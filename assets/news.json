Protesters marched alongside soldiers from the Capsat unit, who drove armoured vehicles, some waving Madagascar flags, from their base in Soanierana in the south of Antananarivo. A Capsat leader, Lylison René de Rolland, then addressed the cheering crowds in front of the city hall in 13 May Square, which protesters had previously been prevented from reaching.

Speaking on state television on Saturday night, the prime minister, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, said the government was “fully ready to listen and engage in dialogue with all factions – youth, unions or the military”. Rajoelina appointed Zafisambo and a new defence and security minister after   in response to the protests. The soldiers’ intervention ratcheted up pressure on Rajoelina, who demonstrators have been demanding stand down. The youth-led protests broke out on 25 September, initially over water and electricity cuts. However, they quickly widened into calls for a complete overhaul of the political system, with the   last week. Earlier in the day, police fired stun grenades and teargas to try to disperse the protesters. The recently appointed minister of the armed forces also called on troops to “remain calm”, at a press conference on Saturday. “We call on our brothers who disagree with us to prioritise dialogue,” minister general Deramasinjaka Manantsoa Rakotoarivelo said. “The Malagasy army remains a mediator and constitutes the nation’s last line of defence.” However, a Capsat leader accompanied by a large group of soldiers called on other military units to “refuse orders to shoot your friends”, in a video that was posted on social media before they left their barracks. “Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters,” he said, also calling on soldiers at the airport to “prevent all aircraft from taking off”. “Close the gates and await our instructions,” he said. “Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades-in-arms, because they will not take care of our families if we die.” Nothing has been posted on the president’s social media accounts since Friday evening, when he was   meeting the heads of 10 of the country’s universities to discuss improving students’ lives. An activist who attended Saturday’s demonstrations said she was concerned about the involvement of Capsat, due to their role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power. She also criticised politicians who made brief addresses to the crowds in front of the city hall as “opportunists”. “That’s why I’m not rejoicing at all, because all of those people gravitating around this ‘event’ are all dangerous,” said the activist, who didn’t want to be named for fear for her safety. A member of Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group of young people that has helped to coordinate the protests, also expressed doubts about what would happen next. “We are very happy, but a lot is happening [and] we don’t want another corrupted person to take the power here, so we will do everything to have the right to choose who to put up there,” he said.", "tags": ["madagascar", "africa", "protest", "news"]},

Youth-led demonstrations on the Indian Ocean island started on 25 September, initially driven by outrage over water and power cuts, but have grown into demands for action against corruption and reform of the political system. At least 22 people have been killed by security forces, according to the UN, which officials denied. On Monday, the president dismissed the prime minister and dissolved the government. However, the   called for more protests, demanding the resignation or dismissal of the president, constitutional court judges, election commission members and parliamentary leaders.

That’s why I tell you to be very careful,” the 51-year-old said, without specifying who he was levying allegations against or providing evidence. Rajoelina, who was installed in power by the military after leading mass protests, said: “Criticism of existing problems does not necessarily have to be expressed in the streets; it should be done through dialogue.” Gen Z protesters rejected the president’s speech. “He said we weren’t real people, that we were robots, accusing us of a cyber-attack on him and mass manipulation … It was very disrespectful actually,” said an 18-year-old activist. He added: “Right now, we still want to protest. It was very peaceful this whole time … But at some point we won’t be able to control it if the young people want to get aggressive, because they [the security forces] respond to us with violence, but it triggers more violence and it makes us even more angry.” Madagascar is one of the world’s poorest countries, despite a wealth of natural resources including precious gems and vanilla.

Since getting married in 2013, Geedi had seen control over Moqokori change hands repeatedly. “Just like how the rain comes and goes, so does control over Moqokori, but this time it was different,” Geedi said. Since launching their offensive in February, al-Shabaab has swept through a swath of Somalia, taking back all the territory it lost to a coalition of government forces and allied tribal militias backed by US and Turkish air support in 2023, and adding more. In July, the fighting had reached within 40km (25 miles) of Mogadishu, the capital. Some observers predicted the capital might fall. “The fear was immense. Word started spreading that [al-Shabaab] were advancing. When the fear got too much to bear, I decided to leave,” said Geedi, who headed for the town of Buloburde, 90km away, with her husband and nine children. In recent weeks, frontlines have stabilised, though government security forces are still on the defensive. There is a construction boom in Mogadishu, and few now believe the capital will be seized by the militants. Though the US has intensified airstrikes against al-Shabaab and other militant groups in Somalia, Washington has signalled it will not send back the hundreds of special forces withdrawn during Donald Trump’s first term. Instead, countries such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uganda have committed troops, training or air support over recent years, while the   continues to field thousands of soldiers. Egypt is now sending a large contingent too. Without this support, government forces would collapse, analysts say. “It’s a strategic stalemate,” said Samira Gaid, regional security analyst with  . “Al-Shabaab are not interested in taking Mogadishu. They have a lot of smaller towns under their control and most of the rural areas. We have been stuck here for a while … and we will be stuck with it for as long as the government has the edge provided by foreign troops.” The success of the recent al-Shabaab offensive has dealt a significant blow to the morale of fragmented security forces and the government of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who pledged   against the militants after taking power in 2022. “I’ve lost 20 friends [fellow soldiers] and have been wounded twice in battle,” said one 42-year-old Somalia National Army veteran in the city of Beledweyne. “I’ve fought in Beera Yabaal, Aboorey, Yasooman, Mabaax, Ceel Qooxle, Adan Yabaal, Masjid Cali Gaduud and Daaru Nicma. In the time since, all these areas have been recaptured by al-Shabaab,” he said. “[Al-Shabaab fighters] believe if they die, heaven awaits them, while most soldiers … want to collect their meagre salaries and return to their families.” The veteran said he was concerned by the rapid gains made by al-Shabaab in recent months but fears worse is to come if nothing is done now to stop the militant advance. “Now [al-Shabaab] are in a position where they can move fighters and supplies [around the country] as result of capturing strategic towns in Hiiraan. This puts many more areas in south and central Somalia at risk of falling. They are moving fast,” he said. Observers point to the government’s weakness as the main cause of the militants’ recent success. “The situation with al-Shabaab on the ground is always determined by the overall political and security environment and that is quite bad at the moment,” said Ahmed Soliman, an expert in east   at Chatham House in London. “There are really big divisions in the country and these make it very difficult for federal government, its forces and international forces to coordinate counter terrorist efforts. Al-Shabaab are taking advantage of a very fragmented political landscape at this time.” Further funding for the $160m a year African Union force in Somalia is also uncertain, which “has an impact on operations”, Soliman said.

Nimo has remained in Beledweyne, which the government has so far successfully defended. “I’m here with family but at the same time nothing is worse then feeling like a refugee on your own soil,” she said. “I want to return home but only time will tell if I ever get the chance.”", "tags": ["somalia", "africa", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "al-shabaab", "news"]},

Five years after the UK quit the bloc, more than a third reported feeling discriminated against by public bodies. One in five said they had experienced difficulties accessing their rights including the right to work, the right to travel in and out of the country and their right to equal treatment in public services. “Five years on from Brexit, the survey results support our current understanding that whilst awareness of rights is increasing, barriers in accessing those rights remain for some citizens. It is also likely that type of issues being faced by EU and EEA Efta citizens will only continue to evolve in complexity,” said Miranda Biddle, the chief executive of the Independent Monitoring Authority (IMA). The IMA is the body set up by the Withdrawal Act 2020 to ensure citizens’ rights to live, work, retire and access health and social welfare were upheld. Brexit was a huge disruption to the 7.1 million people from the EU, the European Economic Area and the European Free Trade Association countries such as Norway, who have either settled or pre-settled status in the UK. When asked what steps the IMA could take to make a difference to their lives, more than half those surveyed cited help to maintain their rights to “travel freely without worry or concern”. They also wanted the IMA to help to ensure adequate access to support when needed and help to ensure future generations were protected. The IMA has been tracking EU citizens’ experiences since 2021, the first full year the UK was outside the bloc. Its citizens’ rights survey 2025 found that the majority of EU citizens were aware of their rights under the withdrawal agreement, a legally binding treaty that formed the basis of Brexit. But the survey exposed some concerning knowledge gaps when it came to children. Almost four in 10 said they had not applied for settled status for their child. Of that group, more than 70% believed their child had an automatic right to British citizenship. There was also a significant number who felt they had been discriminated against by GPs, hospitals, a local authority or the Home Office and Border Force. Only 61% said they trusted public bodies to protect their rights, with distrust higher in the over 65s.

Ever since foolishly calling a snap   which delivered a deadlocked and divided national assembly, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has found himself trapped in a modern political version of the same plot. On Monday morning, the third prime minister Mr Macron has appointed in just over a year became the latest to throw in the towel, after only 27 days in the job. Hours after unveiling his ministerial team, Sébastien Lecornu   following a backlash from centre-right allies, who objected to the number of carryovers from François Bayrou’s previous administration. By Monday evening, Mr Macron had persuaded Mr Lecornu to   a round of last-ditch negotiations to try to resolve the crisis. Should he fail, the president has hinted that the next step will be a second dissolution of parliament and fresh legislative elections. Such dizzying chaos and dysfunction is bringing mainstream French politics into disrepute, at a time when Marine Le Pen’s far right National Rally enjoys a substantial   in the polls. For this ominous state of affairs, Mr Macron bears a heavy responsibility. His centrist alliance   its outright majority in the parliamentary elections of 2022, and was then defeated by a leftwing coalition in the snap poll he called last year. But he has ploughed on as if nothing had changed, pressuring successive prime ministers to   unpopular austerity budgets without a mandate. Persisting with this doomed approach, as bond markets increasingly   the EU’s second largest economy, has been irresponsible. Repeatedly, Mr Macron has called for mainstream politicians to compromise and reach a consensus in the national interest. They have signally failed to do that. But the president himself has been the most obdurate, refusing to make any meaningful concessions. In particular, Mr Macron has failed to acknowledge that the public mood (and parliamentary arithmetic) will not permit deficit-cutting measures that primarily come at the expense of public services and the less well-off. Calls from the left for an annual 2%   on super-rich households, for example, have been resolutely ignored. As the risk of economic instability mounts, with knock-on   for the rest of Europe, France needs to find a way out of the impasse. Even if Mr Lecornu manages to patch things up with the centre-right Les Républicains party, the resulting minority government will almost certainly meet the same ignominious fate as its predecessors. Fresh legislative elections, given the polls, would carry a risk of handing power in parliament to the National Rally, or producing further deadlock. But the present political paralysis and infighting is a gift to Ms Le Pen ahead of presidential elections in 2027. For Mr Macron, who arrived in the Élysée with the avowed intention of preventing the further rise of the far right, the twilight of his second term has turned into a political humiliation. Abroad, he has played a central and   role in shaping Europe’s response to a new era of geopolitical instability. But domestically, a combination of hubris and economic rigidity has left him   and terminally unpopular. It is highly unlikely that he will himself resign, and Mr Lecornu may yet succeed in keeping the show on the road for a while. But France deserves better from its president and its political class.", "tags": ["emmanuel", "macron", "opinion", "france", "marine", "le", "pen", "european", "union", "europe", "tax", "and", "spending", "national", "rally", "editorials"]},

That, at least, was the worrying impression left by a dissonant EU summit in Copenhagen.  last week to build consensus on the top priorities for European rearmament, the meeting was an embarrassing display of the   and hidden agendas that are plaguing attempts to build a coherent European defence. Leaders quarrelled not only about who should be in charge of Europe’s military buildup but also about how to fund Ukraine’s continued resistance against Russian aggression, and how to advance Kyiv’s bid for EU membership. They voiced alarm at repeated breaches of their airspace by drones buzzing European airports and military bases, and Russian fighter jets violating their borders but appeared unsure how to react. Shoot them down? Escort them out? Keep calm and carry on? Or hit back by leveraging frozen Russian assets to provide a giant loan to Ukraine, taking more aggressive steps to choke off Moscow’s oil and gas exports, and  to strike deeper inside Russia? No consensus emerged in Copenhagen, but decisions need to be taken soon. The Russian president,  , must be laughing at the cacophony in the Danish capital and may well draw the conclusion that Europe is weak and divided in response to his mounting provocations. That would be dangerous for all sides. Leaders of the biggest EU powers used the informal summit to slap down the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen’s,   to build a multilayered   for eastern Europe after the spate of Russian airspace violations and incidents involving Moscow’s shadow fleet of sanctions-busting rust-bucket oil tankers. In a paper circulated to leaders, von der Leyen proposed four  : a European drone wall, an eastern flank watch surveillance network, an air defence shield and a defence space shield. She also said the EU executive would monitor member states’ progress in meeting targets to boost readiness by 2030 through a new reporting and assessment process. The French president, Emmanuel Macron,  , saying something “more sophisticated and more complex” was needed. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, slammed overregulation by Brussels and savaged the anti-drone plan behind closed doors. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, complained that Brussels was focused exclusively on protecting eastern countries, and ignoring the southern flank. She also hinted at another objection: this should be Nato’s job, not the EU’s. The row was about power, not drones. National leaders suspected a commission power grab behind the defence initiatives and wanted to put von der Leyen back in her box. It’s fine for Brussels to offer member states €150bn in loans for collaborative defence procurement projects and to ease rules to allow more deficit spending for defence. But big EU governments want to keep control in their own hands, with groups of countries developing different capabilities to meet their   force requirements. These turf wars have been around ever since the EU began to play a role in defence 25 years ago. They have resurfaced more acutely because defence is increasingly the new frontier of European integration. No one can blame Brussels for pressing member states to spend their rising defence budgets more efficiently together rather than duplicating capabilities and failing to build a stronger European defence technology industrial base. That will require harmonising military requirements and buying less from the US.

Besides, the UK remains an indispensable player in European defence despite having left the EU.

Meanwhile, a rival  piloted by the UK, Italy and Japan is moving ahead. Underlying all these disputes is a lack of mutual trust among Europeans, exacerbated by uncertainty over the US commitment to European security under the Trump administration. When countries are not sure how far they can trust each other, their instinct is to fall back on national arms industries and militaries. That is weakening Europe at a time when it needs to project strength and determination towards Russia.

The science secretary, Patrick Vallance, has   that the UK’s spending on new medicines needs to rise from 9% of overall NHS spend, which is below drug spending in the US and many other European countries.

In talks over the summer, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, proposed a deal that would save the pharmaceutical industry £1bn over three years, with billions more promised over the coming decade. But the industry argued that it was forecast to make repayments totalling £13.5bn over the same period and has been demanding about £2.5bn a year extra.

Why? This is the eternal question. When the western-backed,   began in March 2015, I started compiling a mental list of all the ways the war was scorching the concept of childhood in Yemen. How war takes parents away from their children, and our children away from us. How war, not time alone, ages our children. On the streets of Sana’a, I come across pictures of young men who once left childhood for adulthood and then life for death, with flowers and the word “martyr” framing their images. Each time I pass their fading smiles, I think about how many more boys will go from playing in the streets to dying on the battlefields. Those children who weren’t conscripted find themselves fighting another war as hunger leaves their cheeks hollow and eyes sunken. This hunger steals smiles from their faces and breath from their lungs. They become too weak to even cry. They walk around malnourished and vulnerable to preventable diseases. The mothers in Gaza who lost their children to Israeli bombings and genocide had already lost them, because the war machine not only devours flesh, blood and souls but also hopes and dreams. Like us mothers in  , they lost their children when they were suffering without medicine, hungry without bread, imprisoned without justice, tortured, and bearing the psychological pain of losing hope. The same goes for those who may survive bombings in Gaza as it does in Yemen. Survival doesn’t equate to being saved or truly living, just as war is not counted by how many people were killed versus how many survived. All lives are affected, because war has countless ways to turn life into death. What options do those who survive a bombing have when all that remains is a life that feels like slow torture – a life that is worse than death? I know this all too well as a woman living in Yemen: if we are not buried alive, we are living buried, crushed by societal, regional and global judgments and power struggles. The international powers are aware of all of that, from Yemen to Gaza. Many are complicit in the bloodshed and starvation of civilians, profiting from it by arming those who bomb and blockade us. This is the only explanation for their silence and inaction. They don’t want to hear complaints and cries of pain from their citizens, so they silence them, too.

We urgently need a plan to end overfishing, one that follows the science and puts our seas on a long-term path to recovery – ensuring a new generation of coastal prosperity. But this requires leadership. Ministers must act now to redefine the future of fishing, so that those that fish in harmony with nature are prioritised over those that devastate our seabed and empty our seas.” North Sea cod is at critically low levels, yet continues to be overfished. The same is true for Celtic sea cod, Irish sea whiting, Irish sea herring and North Sea and east English Channel horse mackerel. Callum Roberts, a professor of marine conservation at the University of Exeter, said: “These results highlight the gross mismanagement of the UK’s greatest natural asset – its seas. The government has the best fisheries science at its fingertips, and even when data are scarce, the course to restoration is clear. Our seas are already at risk from oil, sewage and agri-chemical pollution; habitat destruction; and the climate crisis. We need to move away from brute extraction, regardless of collateral damage and set a new course to make fishing fair, evidence-based and above all sustainable, so that it works within nature’s limits.” The evidence shows that sensible management can increase fish stocks to healthy levels, sustaining the fishing industry and allowing the wildlife to recover. The UK’s best-performing stocks, including West of Scotland haddock, western Channel sole and North Sea plaice, have remained healthy and sustainably fished since 2020, in large part thanks to catch limits set in line with scientific advice. But there are regional disparities: the Irish Sea is the worst affected, with overfished stocks rising from 27% in 2020 to 41% today, and in the Celtic Sea a third of stocks are overfished to critically low population sizes, and many more overexploited. Western Scotland is the healthiest region, with 62% of stocks assessed as healthy and only 12% overfished. Oceana UK is calling for ministers to deliver a strategy to end overfishing by the end of next year, put in a legal deadline to rebuild fish stocks, and publish an annual parliament-scrutinised audit of fish stocks. Clive Mills, a Sussex fisher, said: “We don’t have another 10 years, I promise you that now. I have seen it since I was a young lad out on the boats, I’m now 66, and I can tell you we are on the edge of a precipice. We’re taking too much, too fast. If fishermen are going to be true to themselves, we’ve got to stop. Fifty years ago, when they brought in fish quotas, we asked ‘what are those for?’ To protect the future of fishing, we were told. And we all thought, that would be good, we need a future for fishing. But we haven’t stayed that course, and now here we are. It’s got to stop.” A Defra spokesperson said: “Defra are working with the fishing industry to promote British seafood and manage stocks sustainably – and have announced a brand new £360m fisheries and coastal growth fund to drive growth in the sector. We are committed to restoring our stocks to sustainable levels and have made significant progress over the past five years, while continuing to support the long-term viability of our domestic fishing industry.”", "tags": ["fishing", "fish", "oceans", "brexit", "marine", "life", "news"]},

The investment bank had previously planned for the registering of biometric data by employees at its new Manhattan skyscraper to be voluntary. However, employees of the US’s biggest bank who have started work at the headquarters since August have received emails saying that biometric access was “required”, according to communications seen by  . Biometric access requires staff to scan their fingerprints or eye to gain access through security gates in the lobby instead of swiping their ID badges. The bank’s headquarters, which cost a reported $3bn (£2.25bn) to build, will eventually be a base for 10,000 employees once it is fully occupied later this year. JP Morgan declined to comment but it is understood that the use of biometric data for access is designed to make the building more secure. There are exemptions for some employees who will still be able to use a badge for access, the Guardian understands, although the criteria for who will use more traditional ID access is unclear. Biometric enrolment is understood to remain voluntary at other JP Morgan offices, including London, where voluntary hand biometrics have been introduced at its Bank Street office. This process involves an employee’s hand print being encrypted so the company does not have access to the data. This system operates in a similar fashion to Apple’s Face ID option on iPhones, where the Silicon Valley company cannot access customers’ facial data. Alongside the introduction of palm and eye scanners, the company has also launched the “Work at JPMC” mobile app, which works as a digital badge and hub for employee services.

From peace and education to health and climate, women are not just affected by crises, they are leading the solutions. It is time for funders, policymakers, multilateral institutions and development agencies to step up, boldly invest and ensure that African women are empowered to lead. Sub-Saharan Africa is poised to be the fastest-growing region in the world. It has a burgeoning youth population, with millions of young people entering adulthood each year. Africa’s destiny will be shaped by those who lead it. And women and girls account for a large and growing share of this demographic rise. Across sub-Saharan Africa there are   adolescent girls, and Africa’s population of girls under the age of 18 is predicted to increase to approximately  . These numbers are not abstract. They mean that for good or ill, the kind of leadership we support today, including that of women, will determine whether Africa’s youth become a source of stability, hope and innovation – or fuel for instability, exclusion and crisis. Around the world, we have seen what happens when young people feel left behind and not fully represented. This is where female leaders come in. Across peacekeeping, education, hunger, health and climate, African women play integral roles. In conflict settings, female peacekeepers, mediators and negotiators are indispensable. African countries such as Ethiopia, Ghana and Rwanda are among   worldwide. These women restore trust, build bridges with communities, protect women and children during conflict and bring gender-sensitive perspectives to negotiations. Security is never gender neutral. In education, millions more girls are attending school across eastern and southern Africa than just a decade ago. Sustaining and expanding that progress requires leadership with a clear eye on equity. Female leaders have consistently pushed for safe schools, invested in teachers and championed girls’ access to science and technology. In health, the story is the same. Where women lead, maternal mortality falls, child health improves and services reach those most in need. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the most effective responses came from female African leaders who mobilised health workers, ensured that vaccines reached communities and demanded global fairness in distribution. While women’s rights worldwide are under attack, Africa continues to show examples of pioneering progress. Rwanda’s parliament, of which  , stands as a global leader. Across the continent, female mediators and leaders of civil society groups have shaped peace agreements and driven reconciliation. These are not symbolic gains. They prove that when women are supported to lead, democracy becomes more inclusive, peace more durable and development more just.

It will be the first dedicated space to nurture, mentor and amplify female African public leaders across the continent. It will build a pipeline: from grassroots change-makers to mayors, from public-health leaders to climate negotiators, from peace mediators to heads of state. This is not charity. It is a strategic investment in democracy, innovation and resilience. The African Women’s House can, and will, serve as a global catalyst where young women are equipped not just with ambition but with skills, networks and mentorship to lead. We are at a critical point as a global community. Climate disasters are worsening, pandemics remain a threat, digital divides are growing and regressive regimes are rising. None of these challenges can be addressed by half of society. When women lead, priorities change: wellbeing is valued and inclusivity prioritised. Focusing on the pipeline of young female African leaders is the best resilience strategy available. It shapes global governance, ensures innovation, deepens democracy and stabilises communities. It ensures that when a catastrophe hits, the response is humane, equitable and effective. To funders and international policymakers, we say: do not wait. Commit now. Invest in institutions that train women as negotiators, mediators, public health administrators, climate scientists and local government leaders. Support policies that remove barriers to women’s leadership. Channel resources to women-led organisations. Elevate African women in your boards, your panels, your missions.

The siege, progressively  , has transformed the city. Trenches cut through neighbourhoods. Civilians move block by block in search of safety, while self-defence groups fight alongside entrenched garrisons. Over these months, El Fasher has become Sudan’s war in miniature, a microcosm where the old tactics of siege and starvation collide with new arsenals, with drones and recently introduced weapons turning the city into a testing ground for modern warfare.  : a laboratory, and a purgatory.  in Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, on 15 April 2023 as an escalating power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime finally turned deadly.  On one side are the Sudanese armed forces, who remain broadly loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s de facto ruler. Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militias who follow the former warlord  , known as Hemedti. The RSF was initially founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia called the  , which quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into the RSF, deploying them to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur. The conflict has plunged Sudan into  , according to UN officials. It has created the  , scattering more than 10 million people internally and 4 million who have fled into neighbouring countries, putting mounting pressure on Chad and South Sudan. Since early October 2024, as the  , civilians have dug trenches in the neighbourhoods to where they were forced to move. Trenches cut through streets, beside houses and around the gathering sites where families now shelter. Shoulder-deep, these trenches flood after rains, becoming what is now the city’s architecture of survival. Since the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) retook Khartoum in April 2025, the RSF has intensified its shelling of El Fasher. “From three or four in the morning, often until late,” one resident says. “We know the schedule now. Each dawn we prepare for it.” Families descend into dark pre-dawn trenches as routine, sometimes sleeping there until the bombardment begins again. Mobile, long-range shelling has become the RSF’s hallmark, more intense every month. The deadliest moments often come in the short sprint between homes and trenches. Ibrahim recalls how two neighbours were killed when they paused to greet each other on their way to their shelters – mere hollows in the ground. Amal describes dragging her grandfather’s body after he was struck by artillery. Pinned down, she sheltered beside his corpse for hours until the shelling eased long enough to leave and bury him. Mohamed speaks of a young man who lay wounded in a flooded trench for two weeks, his leg rotting, before he eventually died. Numerous accounts echo these scenes: frantic descents, long hours underground, tentative returns above; predictably scheduled terror. “The fear never changes,” says Hela, a young woman who fled the city. “If you step outside, something will happen to you.” Sometimes, she says, “when I walked between intervals of shelling and saw someone in the street, I wanted to say: ‘I’m glad we made it, let’s walk together.’” Since last October, drones have brought a new fear. People say they now patrol the skies over El Fasher – erratic and unpredictable – marking one of the first uses of drone warfare in  . For those on the ground, every hum carries the same dread: surveillance or a kamikaze strike. For 17 months, El Fasher has been strangled by the oldest tactics of war: attrition and starvation. As the RSF tightened its grip, it built earthworks to the north, east and south, fortifications that also serve as choke points, blocking nearly every road in and out. The city has been cut off. Only one route remains for civilians to leave, leading west to Tawila, about 60km away. Those who make the journey face checkpoints, ambushes and the risk of disappearing. For men and boys of fighting age, escape is nearly impossible. They either stay and fight, or risk extortion or death on the road. The trek to Tawila – two days on foot or a day by donkey – passes through a series of RSF and allied checkpoints, each demanding payment. “A donkey cart out of El Fasher costs more than a new car, now,” says Leila, who recently escaped the city. An elderly man reached Tawila’s buffer zone after walking from El Fasher, arriving there in the first week of September.   had crammed into the area before him. A volunteer recalls seeing him: “He asked for water, drank, and then collapsed and died in front of us.” If leaving is impossible, life inside is unbearable. After 500 days of siege, the markets are gutted and the city is on the brink of famine. What little food remains is beyond the reach of most. Two kilos of millet sell for $100 (£74), a kilo of sugar or flour for $80, while the average monthly salary, when salaries were still paid, was $70. An estimated  , most relying on four communal kitchens run by volunteers and sustained through community networks. Under fire, with water restricted and supplies scarce, they offer only one meal a day. Like the rest of El Fasher, the kitchens have also been shelled, killing volunteers. The only alternative is the city’s last market, in the Naivasha area, now reduced to a handful of stalls where prices are extortionate. “I get by on one meal if I can,” says Omar. “But during shelling or street fighting, we’re trapped.” Hani, who once worked with smugglers, says the city long relied on them to bring food in, but most are gone. “A few still try at night, but most don’t make it back. It’s suicide now, a deadly gamble.” For many families, the only food available is peanut-shell residue normally used to feed livestock. Civilians with shrapnel wounds are carried into an improvised treatment centre, referred to as the bloc, where volunteers do what they can with little more than salt and torn pieces of cloth. No formal aid has reached El Fasher since the siege began. At Al Saudi, the city’s last semi-functioning hospital, volunteers are often reduced to crude triage, deciding “who will live and who will be left to die”, says Amira, a volunteer. Because of its proximity to the frontline, the hospital has stopped admitting the wounded. SAF soldiers and allied Darfuri fighters are generally treated in separate facilities, one of which was struck and put out of service in the past two weeks. In what is left of their city, most people are confined to the north-west corner. They are crammed into three neighbourhoods and part of an IDP camp, co-located with SAF and SAF-aligned Darfuri groups’ positions. By night, the area falls into darkness and silence. Even solar lamps are kept off for fear of drones. “You can’t even light a cigarette,” says Abdallah, a resident. Alongside SAF soldiers and their Darfuri allies, self-defence groups have multiplied, and armed men fill the streets, as militarisation pervades every part of life. The unspoken reality is that every able man and boy is seen as a potential fighter. And while the blurring of the line between civilian and combatant is not unique to El Fasher, nowhere is it likely to be felt so starkly. El Fasher’s battle has transformed from rudimentary urban combat into sophisticated warfare with weapons Darfur has never known. The siege is no longer just military; it has become political, even existential. The siege endures largely because of external support. Public and private accounts point to UAE military supplies and   that have carried the RSF beyond its capacity.

Before the start of the conflict in 2023, the figures in his photographs were often covered in flowers or holding heart shapes, challenging stereotypes of masculinity. Now, flowing red fabric representing trauma, loss and bloodshed is a frequent motif. Nasr describes his art as “dreamlike” – his project On War and Displacement features a series of striking, surreal images with anonymous figures wearing traditional white Sudanese robes, their identities concealed beneath conical masks. In one of his most recent works, two figures sit in front of a TV, from which a length of red fabric flows out towards them. “Me and my family are always stuck in front of TV, watching news of what’s happening in Sudan,” says Nasr, who now lives in Egypt. But, he adds: “All you get from TV is news of destruction, blood and loss.” In other photos, the red fabric trails from a suitcase or flows between different buildings, representing how war has pushed Sudanese to leave their homes and find new ones. War has also transformed how the dentist turned photographer views his work: from a form of personal creative expression to a tool for raising awareness about the situation in his country, which the UN calls  . “I feel this heavy weight on me to speak up. I need to express who I am and the impact this war has on me as a person [and] my family,” he says. Nasr was on holiday in Egypt in April 2023 when the war in Sudan broke out and has not been able to return. He still struggles to adapt to life abroad, he says, living in a small home knowing that his large family house in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, has been looted by militia fighters. At least 3.3 million Sudanese have fled Sudan since 2023, with 1.5 million arriving in Egypt,  , while the remainder are spread throughout Sudan’s other neighbours. While Nasr’s close family escaped Sudan, many of his relatives are among the 8 million internally displaced people. Within two months of the war starting, an uncle who had been on dialysis died because he was trapped in his home, unable to access treatment. “It was really hard news for us to take at that time because we’d been asking them to go to a safer place, or at least get his medication,” says Nasr. “But anytime they tried to leave there were clashes outside.” Nasr began experimenting with art during the Covid-19 pandemic, when his dental practice was closed, taking self-portraits and using friends as models.

Sylvain Penicaud, MSF project coordinator in Tawila, North Darfur state, said families in displacement and refugee camps often had no choice but to drink dirty water, the main cause of cholera. “Just two weeks ago, a body was found in a well inside one of the camps.

A Guardian investigation into the 72-hour attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on North Darfur’s Zamzam camp, the country’s largest for people displaced by the war, found repeated testimony of mass executions and large-scale abductions. Hundreds of civilians remain unaccounted for. The magnitude of likely casualties means the assault by the RSF ranks only behind   in West Darfur two years ago. The war between the Arab-led RSF and Sudanese military, which broke out in April 2023, has been characterised by repeated atrocities, forcing millions from their homes and causing  . Until now, reports about the attack on Zamzam between 11 and 14 April had indicated that up to 400 non-Arab civilians were killed during the three-day assault. The UN has said  died. However, a committee set up to investigate the death toll has so far “counted” more than 1,500 killed in the attack, which occurred on the eve of a   in London intended to bring peace to Sudan. Mohammed Sharif, part of the committee from Zamzam’s former administration, said the final total would be significantly higher, with many bodies still not recovered from the camp, which is now controlled by the RSF. “Their bodies are lying inside homes, in the fields, on roads,” Sharif told the Guardian. An atrocity expert with decades of experience in Darfur, who has interviewed scores of survivors from Zamzam, believes up to 2,000 people may have been killed. Speaking on condition of anonymity, they added that the levels of violence were striking even when viewed alongside the   of ethnic African groups in Darfur during the 2000s by the Arab militias who would later become the RSF. “Every single testimony from everyone who escaped knew family members who were killed. That’s something I’ve never seen before.” Abdallah Abugarda, of the UK’s Darfur Diaspora Association, said that about 4,500 members of his organisation knew a friend or relative killed in the attack. At least 2,000 Zamzam residents, he said, remain missing. “The massacre at Zamzam, home to displaced people for over 20 years, is one of the most heinous crimes in recent global history. Yet no global outrage has followed,” added Abugarda. Claire Nicolet, deputy head of emergencies for   (MSF), said the attack had targeted “one of the most vulnerable people on earth”. Those who survived, she said, had faced “widespread looting, sexual violence and other attacks while on the road and appalling living conditions in transit displacement sites”. Large numbers of women were abducted and remain missing. Sharif said they knew of more than 20 who had been taken to Nyala, an RSF stronghold 160km from Zamzam. Last month, the International Criminal Court said it had   to conclude that war crimes and crimes against humanity were unfolding in Darfur. In Geneina, West Darfur’s capital,   – mainly Masalit and other non-Arab Sudanese – are believed to have been killed by the RSF and allied militias over two months from mid-April 2023. An episode of fighting during November that year   killed more than 800, according to the UN.

The RSF was initially founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia called the  , which quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into the RSF, deploying them to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur. The conflict has plunged Sudan into  , according to UN officials. It has created the  , scattering more than 10 million people internally and 4 million who have fled into neighbouring countries, putting mounting pressure on Chad and South Sudan. Famous for her gap-toothed perma-grin, the 43-year-old single mother was an El Fasher legend, the survivor of more than 150 battles. If she fell, everyone agreed, so would the city. “But the fighting is getting very dangerous. Their snipers constantly target me,” she says. Reports indicated the RSF was advancing south, deeper into the city, in its push to capture the   military’s final stronghold in the Darfur region. Women were abducted. Others, executed on the spot. “We fight to survive. We have no choice but to protect our families,” says Bakhit. For six hours the battle swung to and fro. Then, abruptly, the RSF retreated to their trenches surrounding the city. Bakhit cheered, but tonight there would be no celebratory feast. Food supplies in the city were spent. Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a   instead. El Fasher had been under siege for  . In May 2024, the UN   it teetered on the “brink of famine”. No aid has entered since. The August battle that wounded Abdelghaffa was the RSF’s 228th attempt to seize the city. The struggle for El Fasher remains the defining showdown of Sudan’s   between its army and the RSF. Victory for the RSF means total control over western Sudan, cleaving the vast nation in half. Somehow, against all odds, El Fasher has not fallen. Its defenders – a hotchpotch of volunteers like Abdelghaffa, rebels such as Bakhit and a depleted infantry battalion – have been shoehorned into a shrinking slice of the pulverised city with 260,000 trapped residents, half of them children. “It’s a medieval siege; something you’d expect in the middle ages,” says Sheldon Yett of Unicef. Yet aid has not entered for nearly 18 months. The reason, according to leaked documents, intelligence sources and senior UN officials, raises profound questions over the international community’s priorities. The evidence indicates a key US and UK ally intervened to effectively derail lifesaving humanitarian aid entering El Fasher. The   (UAE) intruded at a critical stage; hundreds of children are believed to have since died from starvation in the city. The US state department officials have directly implored the petrostate to back a pause in fighting and allow aid into El Fasher. Senior UN humanitarian officials also negotiated directly – to no avail. The UAE,  , denies it supports the group. Informed sources monitoring the crisis claim that one of the longest urban sieges of modern warfare has only been possible because of such backing. “The UAE is the lifeline to the siege. Without its support, the RSF would have called it off.” Intelligence assessments indicate that the RSF is bent on ethnic cleansing should El Fasher fall. Model scenarios forecast thousands will be massacred. The assessments confirmed the RSF wanted to overrun the city during the rainy season, which started in early June and brought cloud, which the aggressors knew would make it harder for satellites to capture war crimes. And as the June skies above El Fasher darkened, Abdelghaffa was summoned to the city’s northern front. RSF reinforcements were massing. The endgame had begun. A convoy trundled across north Darfur’s desert, three hours from El Fasher. Fifteen trucks: each driver as nervous as the next. No truck had reached the city since April 2024. Four thousand kilometres north, David Lammy – then UK foreign secretary – was holding court at a five-star hotel in Marrakech, Morocco. Earlier, he had unveiled the UK’s new approach to Africa, yet one country now held his attention. Castigating the world for its “ambivalence” towards Sudan’s war, Lammy confirmed it as the world’s “worst humanitarian catastrophe”. Ground zero was El Fasher, and the situation was about to worsen. Shortly after Lammy’s speech, the Darfur convoy was  . In El Fasher, the news brought despair. Abdessalam Kitir, 50, who lived near the university with his wife and son, says: “It confirmed we were on our own. Vulnerable people were left exposed to famine, death.” Abdelghaffa had seen what violence did: the   that slaughtered 300,000 of the ethnic African tribes, surviving members of which now crammed into El Fasher for protection.

More fighters were needed. “I had no option. To the front I must go,” she told her friend Ibrahim Ahmed. The RSF, the latest iteration of the  , had embarked on a recruitment surge. Thousands of their fighters encircled the city. Keeping them at bay was getting harder. The attackers wielded hi-tech weaponry which, sources allege, was being flown into Nyala, 120 miles (193km) south. The nearest advancing friendly forces were 350 miles east. Their ranks included Bakhit’s youngest son. “He will come to liberate us,” she laughs. Unlike Abdelghaffa, Bakhit had fought before. She had battled Darfur’s Arab militias as a teenager. Later, they had killed her husband. The RSF was even responsible for her trademark grin: a fighter had jabbed his rifle into her mouth. The 214th attack on El Fasher concentrated on  , the immense displacement camp at the city’s northern edge. It was the biggest for months. “They had new weapons. The whole city shook,” says Adam Mohammed, a resident. Howitzers obliterated homes. Suicide drones approached from the east. Fighters advanced. Abdelghaffa could not let Abu Shouk fall, a safe haven for those who had fled the genocide. Plus it held El Fasher’s final functioning market, Naivasha, where supplies were down to five sacks of millet. At 5pm the RSF withdrew. Abdelghaffa’s unit of volunteers had defended the market – for another day, at least. Kitir heard the guns fall silent. A former official for the UN’s dissolved Darfur peacekeeping operation, he did not abandon the city he cherished. But another long night lay ahead. Staples such as sorghum had almost disappeared. Most community kitchens were closing: there was nothing to cook. Children ate locusts. Well-connected individuals like Kitir sporadically acquired meat, but it was getting harder. The siege was tightening. Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a   instead. Intelligence indicated the attack 24 hours earlier on El Fasher was meant to overrun the city. There were candid warnings of  . An   of the UN security council (UNSC) on Sudan was called. El Fasher was careering towards cataclysm. Malnourished children were dying daily. Some diplomats felt the siege was not being taken seriously. “Where was the action? The urgency?” says one. A UNSC resolution had urged an end to the siege, but that was a year ago. The noose around El Fasher’s neck had since tightened. Concern was mounting over the UK’s approach. As council “ ” on Sudan, it was responsible for galvanising global response. Yet Russia had vowed to veto any UK resolution, negating its influence. A solution was engineered. Representing Africa, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Algeria offered to look after Sudan. The UK refused to cede control. “The UK was providing political cover for the UAE,” alleges a UN investigator. Silencing the security council on El Fasher, they claim, blocked scrutiny of the UAE’s role. Jenny Chapman, development minister, said the UK used its position at the UN and elsewhere to “apply diplomatic pressure”. Another UN security council session on Sudan was called. Internal pressure was growing to secure a reprieve for El Fasher. Inside the city, families had started chewing leaves to survive. Presenting evidence to the council was Sudan specialist  . Days earlier she had returned from the country, enraged. Without naming the UK, Lewis condemned the complicity of states “who continue to prioritise Emirati investments” over El Fasher’s starving families. Where, she wondered, was the council’s conscience? A year earlier, discussions involved UN troops in Darfur forcing their way into El Fasher if needed. States privately discussed sanctioning the UAE. Now, ambitions had lowered. The UNSC settled on pursuing a week-long humanitarian pause. Lewis left the UN’s headquarters deflated. Convinced genocide was impending, she feared the council was “satisfied issuing statements”. The UN’s humanitarian pause was rejected by the RSF. To reinforce this, rockets pounded El Fasher. RSF fighters stormed towards the centre, reaching Tijaniya Mosque. In the north, Abdelghaffa held her position. Bakhit’s artillery helped push back the attackers. Throughout, the mother of three was targeted by snipers. Despite the RSF’s public rejection of a humanitarian pause, internal documents reveal a different story. A secret meeting at an undisclosed location occured between US and UN officials and chief RSF negotiator, Brig Gen Omar Hamdan. The meeting was considered a triumph. Hopes soared that aid would shortly be allowed into El Fasher. Documents state: “While no formal commitment was made regarding the pause in El Fasher, RSF leadership indicated the proposal would be reviewed internally. A response would follow pending further consultations.” Such consultations, said sources, would involve the UAE. Previously, the Emiratis had stated support for humanitarian pauses. Optimism was so high that UN officials felt it was now a question of when, not if. Articulating the mood, one document adds that “in anticipation of the pause in El Fasher,” preparations are to immediately begin to “strategically preposition critical relief supplies across key locations in Darfur to enable rapid deployment”. Convoys laden with aid for El Fasher were readied. A capacity crowd squeezed into London’s Guildhall for a keynote   by David Lammy. Urging a relationship reset, he name-checked 10 countries from the continent. Its third largest, Sudan, was not mentioned. In Port Sudan, “multiple outreach attempts” to RSF leaders were being made by UN officials, desperate to establish how aid might enter El Fasher. Time was tight. Satellites documented hundreds of new burial mounds within the city. The US was vexed at the lack of urgency. It began lobbying Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, the RSF leader   in Darfur. “The US has emerged as the most actively engaged, undertaking direct outreach to the RSF leadership,” observe UN documents. Elsewhere, the UK and others were assigned to drum up diplomatic support for El Fasher. In Nyala, the aid convoy was ready. “We waited for the green light,” says a UN official. Bakhit had never experienced hunger like it. The city’s   – which distributed donated food – closed. It had nothing to share. In Naivasha, a few hardy traders hawked the little they had. “We are close to starvation,” says Bakhit. Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a   instead. People turned to  , an unappetising brown sludge made from pressed peanuts traditionally fed to livestock. Ambaz gave children cramps and diarrhea. Despite it being chronically deficient in essential vitamins and minerals, the demand for ambaz outstripped supply. Abdelghaffa and Bakhit survived on a single daily serving. At this stage, academics believed El Fasher’s population was likely enduring unprecedented levels of starvation. Unpublished provisional data documenting the impact of a  , detected “extremely elevated” levels of malnutrition, higher than ever previously documented there. Daylight heralded another offensive, this time from the south. Lookouts confirmed that the 220th attempt to seize the city was the biggest yet. Bakhit tried forcing the attackers back, but the city’s hungry defenders were outpowered and outnumbered. “So much new weaponry was arriving at El Fasher that even the RSF was overwhelmed by the pace of its arrival,” says an arms investigator. For seven hours the RSF advanced, capturing the cattle market, prison and a military headquarters. By mid afternoon, the attackers were only a mile from Bakhit. Dusk fell; the RSF retreated. Bakhit viewed this as a hollow victory. The attack was the first time the RSF had invaded her city in sizeable numbers since the siege began. In London and Washington, real-time satellites had tracked the incursion. The assessment from analysts was ominous. A security source says: “El Fasher was wobbling. How long could it hang on?” The siege deepened. Anyone leaving or entering El Fasher was apprehended. Traders were whipped and beaten. Some were humiliated: forced to jive to Arab music or “baa” like sheep. Others were simply executed. Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a   instead. Inside the city, Kitir endured the constant shelling. Any fledgling hopes of fleeing with his family faded. All he could do was wait for help that might never materialise. “We will never, ever escape,” he says. Bakhit, meanwhile, insisted victory was achievable. “We will win this!” she told everyone she met. Two decades ago, she had met the then UN secretary-general Kofi Annan   as the west rallied to safeguard survivors of the genocide. Bakhit wondered why the world wouldn’t come to their rescue again. Regardless, she was prepared to fight to the death. She had no inkling that, three hours away in Nyala, help for El Fasher was being assembled. In a central warehouse, 28 trucks waited with medical equipment and food for 100,000 people. A UN source says: “We were all set. What was the hold up?” Finally, the RSF responded to demands for a humanitarian pause. Hopes of a reprieve for El Fasher shrivelled. A written response from the group concluded aid into the city was “not feasible”. A shred of hope, however, emerged from the RSF correspondence: it was willing to open humanitarian corridors to facilitate the “safe exit of civilians”. Was it a trap? Intelligence indicated the RSF believed “no more civilians” remained in El Fasher. It also wanted to kill every fighter. In Nyala, the convoy was partly disassembled. Significant quantities of aid had spoiled: food for 40,000 people was destroyed. Around El Fasher, satellites observed something odd sprouting from the desert. Imposing earthworks – at least 9 miles long – encircling the city. The city was being   by the RSF. Access to El Fasher was increasingly restricted to a 50-yard gap between the berms where RSF guards executed passersby. “It is like a moat. Entering the city has become forbidden,” says Kitir. Even less food was entering the city: ambaz was becoming scarce. The shelling, meanwhile, was getting heavier. His neighbours joined first aid classes in case relatives were hit. While the giant berms stopped food getting in, they also prevented people leaving. People were shot scrambling over the earthworks at night. A “kill box” suffocated the city. “Anyone who leaves is abducted, robbed or worse. We have no choice but to stay,” says Kitir. But staying meant starvation. El Fasher’s fate had been effectively decided at another secret meeting days earlier. UN officials had again met RSF negotiator Hamdan, pleading for a show of clemency. Hamdan’s mood had hardened. Lingering hopes of a humanitarian pause were dashed. Allowing aid in, said Hamdan, was now “untenable”. Attempts to overrun El Fasher became international. Foreign fighters congregated outside its periphery. Bakhit says she witnessed Libyans, Ethiopians and Colombians alongside the RSF. Friends reported they had heard shouting in Spanish. Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a   instead. RSF reinforcements poured in from the Sahel, too. Inside El Fasher, the worst time was the pre-bombardment calm, says Kitir. “Everybody fears the first shell – the bomb of the martyrs. So unpredictable. After, everybody finds cover.” Cover meant trenches. Everyone crouched in them, counting the shells, for hours at a time. Kitir became adept at distinguishing the sounds of the weaponry deployed to kill him: the booming of an AH-4 howitzer, the scream of Katyusha rocket launchers. But it was the suicide drones that most shredded the nerves. Day and night they buzzed above his neighbourhood. It was a trap. The RSF’s promise of safe passage was precisely the opposite. Entire groups who made a break for freedom were murdered. A party of 50 civilians was abducted. Sporadic footage surfaced of atrocities. The most notorious involved a Naivasha market restaurateur, executed by an RSF officer. Kitir knew his neighbour. He left behind a young son. The little food on sale was prohibitively expensive: seven times higher than usual. Priced out, Kitir turned to ambaz. He sent an image of a bowl he shared with his chickens. Bakhit worried where her next meal was coming from. The shelling worsened, running continuously from 10am to 6pm. Kitir waited in the trenches, counting the bombs. “Between 200 and 300 at a time, all targeting civilian areas.” Faced with overwhelming evidence that the RSF was readying to overrun El Fasher, senior UN officials agreed they had to pressure those the RSF obeyed: the Emirates. Documents confirm “intensified” diplomatic pressure directed towards the UAE. The US came fully on board. Senior state department figures, including  , implored officials from UAE’s ministry of foreign affairs to lift the siege. Lord knew what was at stake. Second in command of the bureau of  , his previous role was senior adviser for Sudan. Lord understood the potential for genocide should the RSF take El Fasher. But the US’s efforts – described as “sustained pressure” in documents – yielded no late reprieve. Increasingly exasperated, the US wanted the RSF and army in the same room. A summit on Sudan was arranged for Geneva, Switzerland. There, US officials would meet UAE representatives in another attempt to secure clemency for El Fasher. Far from acquiescing, documents reveal that the UAE appears to have actively intervened to thwart prospects of a humanitarian pause for the besieged city. The UAE declined to comment. Instead of supporting aid into El Fasher, the UAE advocated tying the city’s predicament to the agreement of a series of other humanitarian pauses for besieged towns in  . The plan all but killed off help for El Fasher. The UAE’s suggestion meant a significantly more onerous, complex strategy was required. “UAE informally indicated that there may be more traction if El Fasher and Kordofan were discussed as a set – ie the RSF could be seen as ‘having lost the political game’ if they allow the pause to happen only in El Fasher,” the documents reveal. Digesting the Emiratis’ intervention, UN officials reluctantly began identifying “operationally viable locations” within Kordofan, a process that meant new negotiations with no guarantee of success. Cajoling the Emirates was seen by many as the last throw of the dice. Help for El Fasher had never felt so elusive. Volley after volley of artillery  . Hundreds of residents, many carrying children, streamed south. Abdelghaffa waited near the market. Dozens of RSF pickups sped south, shooting at residents crawling away. Abdelghaffa was injured and had to be carried towards the airport. Two of her children were among 19 wounded. When the RSF withdrew, more than 50 civilians lay dead amid the camp’s ruins. The attack on Abu Shouk – a blatant violation of international law – focused the attention of the UNSC. A council  again urged an end to the siege and confirmed the RSF was deliberately targeting civilians. No fresh sanctions, however, were directed against the RSF’s leadership. In Nyala, the convoy for El Fasher was restocked. Blind optimism according to some, but expectations were galvanised by the prospect of talks in Geneva the following day. Hopes quickly curdled: neither the RSF or Sudanese army  . In El Fasher, Bakhit visited Al Saudi hospital where Abdelghaffa was recuperating. “I offered Mariam my support for a full recovery.” Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a   instead. Bakhit was worried whether Abdelghaffa would survive. With no medicines, not even painkillers, any injury could prove fatal. “We use herbal medicines, leaves – and lots of praying,” says Ibrahim Suleman, who lives in the city. The last functional hospital was bustling. “Constant shelling meant many civilians suffered,” says Bakhit. But the biggest killer did not fall from above. Youngsters were “dying immediately” from starvation says regional expert  . Nutritional supplements for children expired months earlier. Rates of miscarriage were “very high” she adds. Childbirth was becoming a death sentence. Attention turned to the skies. The UN explored using its humanitarian air service to drop aid over El Fasher. The possibility of enrolling the Jordanian air force, fresh from its airdrops  , was floated. The obstacle was anti-aircraft missile systems scanning the skies above El Fasher. The RSF warned that UN aircraft were legitimate targets. “They refused us safe passage,” says a UN source. At any rate, the need was massive. “You can’t airdrop your way out of a situation like El Fasher: a plane holds a fraction of a truck’s capacity,” says the source. Humanitarian officials were frantic. Could the RSF be deceived somehow? An audacious plot was hatched. With the RSF’s consent, aid trucks would travel into Darfur but not to El Fasher. In reality, their cargo was destined for the besieged city. The convoy reached Mellit – 56 miles north of El Fasher – around lunchtime. The RSF must have suspected something. Soon after, a drone thudded into the convoy, destroying three of the 16 trucks. Undeterred, the plan went ahead. A network of smugglers started lugging the surviving aid south. But could they navigate the gauntlet of berms, kill squads and checkpoints that lay ahead? Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a   instead. Inside El Fasher, ambaz was sought after like a delicacy. Residents eked it out with water. Kitir ate grass that sprouted in the streets. Others chanced a foul juice made from leaves called   – “kill me”. Stomach cramps were guaranteed. A family of six died in their sleep after consuming food waste. Naivasha market limped on. Rice hit £50 a kilo. A sack of ambaz sold for £110. Desperation thrived. Abdelghaffa recovered – and immediately returned to Abu Shouk’s frontline. She was busy. The RSF were pushing further into the displacement camp. Targeted relentlessly by drones, the decision was taken to fall back. It was the same story across the city. To the south, defenders retreated from the livestock market, scene of much bloodshed. Units on the eastern axis gave ground. El Fasher’s fall felt inevitable. Five hundred days since the siege began, El Fasher’s nightmare continued to worsen. Inconceivably, the shelling intensified. Between 700 and 1,000 shells fell daily. Bakhit’s neighbour’s home was flattened. Kitir spent whole days in the trenches. To the north, near Abdelghaffa’s position, RSF snatch squads crept closer, abducting dozens of women and children. None were seen again. Much of Abu Shouk was now controlled by the RSF. Outside the city, the RSF kept building berms. El Fasher was entirely encircled. UN humanitarians, though, refused to concede defeat, haranguing the RSF. It was like screaming into the void. One says: “We reached stalemate. Nothing is going to give.” Food unexpectedly arrives in El Fasher. “The situation is suddenly much better,” says a buoyant Kitir. He even predicted prices might fall. Residents were baffled at the influx. But the UN’s secret ploy had worked. It was a brief reprieve. UN officials knew there could be no repeat. From now, El Fasher was on its own. In London, Lammy   an Emirati delegation. It was one of his final acts as foreign secretary. A day later he was gone. Any pretence that help might reach El Fasher was entirely abandoned. Accepting impending annihilation, the military had planted a minefield around its territory. A humanitarian pause was now impossible. “The de-mining you’d need to deliver aid would be massive and time-consuming,” says a UN source. “You need a full ceasefire that no one will agree to.” Inside El Fasher, the mood was remarkably upbeat. Abandoned, its residents invested faith in their own people to save them. Bakhit was convinced her son’s battalion – 300 miles to the east – would arrive to save them. “He will come. Watch!” she laughed. Kitir felt similarly sanguine. “The people are very optimistic for our advancing fighters.” World leaders gathered in New York for the UN general assembly. Several debates on El Fasher are planned. Too little, too late. The city’s defences were  . With the rains almost over, the RSF launched its most ferocious offensive yet. Naivasha market fell. Attackers stormed a key military base, headquarters of former peacekeeping force UNAMID. Abu Shouk, home to 190,000 genocide survivors, was overrun. Families streamed south, desperate for shelter. Backed by newly arrived drones, entire neighbourhoods were devastated. Kitir’s house was struck by a shell, collapsing his ceiling. A mosque next door was obliterated. Bodies of friends were strewn across his street. Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a   instead. Survivors are advised not to venture outside. Starving but unbowed, Kitir, his wife and son retreat into the remains of their home. RSF fighters are 600 yards from their oor. “These days are very difficult,” says Kitir. Nearby, Bakhit is fighting around the clock, hemmed in as attackers advance from three sides.  In the pandemonium, Abdelghaffa disappeared. Repeated attempts to locate her have failed. Last sightings suggest she ventured north, clutching her rifle, to defend Abu Shouk. “It was her duty,” says friend Zubaida Ahmadi. “She knew there was nobody coming to help us.” Maybe, somehow, the grandmother is still out there, refusing to budge, fighting with every last breath for her doomed home.", "tags": ["global", "development", "sudan", "africa", "conflict", "and", "arms", "united", "arab", "emirates", "war", "crimes", "david", "lammy", "features"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/07/moving-the-goalposts-sporting-english-players", "content": "Sporting CP have a rich history of developing prodigious young talents, none more so than Cristiano Ronaldo, and the club’s philosophy is spreading to their successful women’s team. Although Sporting have not broken the domestic dominance of Benfica, no more proof of their development success is needed than  , who was plucked from Canada’s academy system and sold to Liverpool a year later for a club record fee. Now Sporting are expanding into a new market: English players. Their squad contains two players familiar to followers of the Lionesses’ youth teams: the 25-year-old Georgia Eaton-Collins, who joined from the Danish side HB Køge last year, and the Chelsea academy product Ria Bose, who is 19. For two players at different stages of their careers, the move to Lisbon has brought different lessons. “I’ve played in a few different places now and each one has brought different challenges for me,” says Eaton-Collins, who also spent time in the US college system and had a short spell back in England with Leicester. “Sporting in particular has been a big learning curve for me in terms of the technical side of the game because I’m surrounded by very smart, technical players every day and that’s helped bring out a different side to my game.” That is echoed by Bose, who had never experienced football outside the English academy system, having joined Brighton as a six-year-old before moving to Chelsea. “The style of play was the most difficult to adapt to,” she says. “Chelsea and England is near as much the same, as it is across England. There’s a set style of play across the board you become very comfortable with, and here I just had to ask questions to see where I could improve; ultimately it’s why I came here, to add more to my game. It’s been challenging, but I wouldn’t change it for the world.” Bose also has a chance to grow away from the pitch after leaving home in the south of England for the first time. “It’s been a challenging but rewarding process. Coming in and getting injured like I did isn’t ideal, but the rewarding part is being around the senior Portuguese players because you look up to them and you see every day the effort they put into professionalism and helping the young players. “That’s what I’ve learned the most. It’s such a special thing here. If I’m injured, they go out of their way to make you feel included and that’s where you see the effort they put into the whole environment.” Bose and Eaton-Collins had never crossed paths but Bose describes her teammate as a “big sister” and has gone to great lengths to feel at home. “The hardest part was not having a dog, so I got a dog! I’ve never been without one. My mum was surprised, though, when I told her.” On Eaton-Collins, she says: “Having someone to talk to about things and places you know and the experiences you’ve had, I’m really grateful she’s here. When I was injured, she was always someone I could go to.” Bose admits the move away from familiarity was initially tougher than expected. “I didn’t realise how hard it would be at first. I thought: ‘Oh, I’ve been away with England, it’ll be fine.’ But it’s different – but I’ve also never had a closer connection to teammates than I’ve had here. “It’s your home away from home and being able to put my trust 100% in my teammates is something I’ve had to work on, but you have to be comfortable being uncomfortable and that’s been so important for me to mature both on and off the pitch. If you’d told me this time last year I’d be living on my own in a different country, I wouldn’t have believed it.” Eaton-Collins jokes: “The main difference is the later eating times, so I’m still adapting to the late dinners.” More seriously, she says of going abroad: “It’s accepting your path is not the same as everyone else’s, and I’ve developed in so many different ways than if I’d just stayed in England.” It is not hard to understand the lure of Sporting. Aside from the great city and weather, the history of the club is palpable and there is an emphasis on individual development alongside team success. “When I spoke with Sporting, I realised they were trying to recreate that history in terms of developing players,” says Eaton-Collins. “You see players like Cristiano Ronaldo and how well this academy is known worldwide. I came here a bit later in my career than Ria, but it’s the same concept, bringing in players viewed as high potential and developing them to be able to say Sporting identified talent and is successful in doing that over and over again.” Bose, set on leaving academy football for a foreign club, concluded Sporting were the ideal match. “I had loads of calls with teams across Europe – I was never set on coming to Portugal – but when I had the first call with Sporting, it wasn’t just a pitch about football, it was a pitch about a new home. That really got to me because it was different to what everyone else was saying. “I’ve really enjoyed it. It’s a different experience, you’re far away from home, you have to find new ways to connect with people, but it’s become a home away from home.” If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email  .", "tags": ["women's", "football", "moving", "the", "goalposts", "newsletter", "european", "club", "football", "newsletters"]},

That’s whatI missed, the adrenaline and addiction to competing. I spent years trying to find that feeling again. “I ran a couple of marathons and I did all sorts of things trying to hunt that feeling down, but I had to get it into my mind that I’m never going to have that feeling again in the same way. I had to teach myself to say: ‘Listen, you’re not going to get that back, so stop trying to find it.’ Once I got there, then I could move myself forward.” Chapman won a WSL title with Chelsea and two FA Cups before she ended a 22-year career that began with her debut for Millwall Lionesses in 1996 at the age of 14. She was a critical component in Arsenal’s 2006-07 quadruple-winning team, having joined from Charlton in 2006, and won 13 major trophies with the Gunners during two spells before signing for Chelsea. She is lacing up her boots again, for the second time in six and a half months, to take part in   at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, having become the first woman to play for the Blues in the reverse fixture at Anfield. All proceeds from the game will go to the Chelsea FC Foundation and Chelsea Players’ Trust – two wings of the club Chapman is keen to support having found her step away from playing tough. Laura Cordingley, the CEO of the Chelsea Foundation, helps drive the work to support current and former players. “We have a huge duty of care towards those that have come before, not least because it’s really important to the club, but also from a foundation perspective, because our players and past players are so inspirational to the next generation of young people coming through,” she says. “Players can help us support the right narratives with young people too, with those who may or may not make it as professional football players.” The support is wide-ranging and for any player who has stepped through the doors in Cobham, be it for 10 years or one day. “It doesn’t matter when they may need support or what it looks like, we will be there for them,” Cordingley says. “What we really want to make sure is that we’re not overlapping. We work closely with the player care team in the academy and we make sure we’re greater than the sum of our parts. One of the first things we do is go to the PFA [Professional Footballers’ Association] and ask what support they have available. Then we look at how we can be additive to that. It’s about how we bring all the right people together to create the right package of support.” Chapman, who does many things including working as a pre- and postnatal personal trainer and co-hosting a grassroots football podcast, became a women’s ambassador for Chelsea after retiring, which was a lifeline, but she struggled. “It’s really tough,” she says. “I had a mortgage to pay and I had kids to look after and I did need to jump from one job to another. I didn’t have the time to breathe. I was lucky that Chelsea took me on as an ambassador that helped me with that gap between things. “I had a lot of anxiety for many years. When you’re an athlete you don’t show weakness – struggling is a weakness – and it’s hard sometimes for you to put yourself out there and ask for help and ask what help’s available. It took me quite a long time to come to terms with that and think: ‘I do need help, I do need support and it’s not a weakness.’ “I had counselling through the Professional Footballers’ Association when I hadcome to terms with the fact that I was really struggling. Back then there was support available, but did we really know it was there and have access to it? Not really. Did we understand what was available? Not really. I think that’s got better over the years.” Losing the structure and routine of professional football is “a big part of it”, she says. “You know what you’re doing on a daily basis, what you’re doing with your body, what training looks like, what meetings look like. Everything’s managed for you. There’s also an identity piece as well. You come out and you’re like: ‘Who am I?’” Chapman had another part of her life to fall back on. As a mother of three she slotted into being mum instead of professional player. “I dived into that and I’m grateful for that because I could have ended up in a different space,” the former Chelsea captain says. “Regardless of whether we think we’re ready for the next stage or not, the impact is massive. When I talk to a lot of people, not just in football, but around any sport, it’s the same.” The risk is that athletes stepping back from their sports, searching for new purpose and obsession, can find it in dark places. “It can become really dangerous,” says Chapman. “I came out of football and I was like: ‘Oh my God, I understand why people go off the rails and they go in all kinds of different directions and potentially find an addiction somewhere else.’ It is because you’re searching for that adrenaline piece, that feeling you got from competing, and we can all go different ways with that.” That is why she cares about the work being done to support players and is taking part in the legends match. That, and she would struggle to pass up an opportunity to play. “I love it. It makes me feel alive again and puts a smile on my face. It also gives me a rewarding feeling. Finding work that I love and that gives me a rewarding feeling is what matters most.” Old habits die hard. “It’s funny, my mindset is that if I’m going to do these things, I have to be good,” says Chapman. “I train myself to be in the right condition. My mindset hasn’t changed in that sense. TI’m going out there representing women, women’s football. “If I want to keep pushing women’s football forward, I need to be in the right place and the right mindset to go into that game and give the best I possibly can.” If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email  .", "tags": ["women's", "football", "moving", "the", "goalposts", "newsletter", "chelsea", "women", "newsletters"]},

A cracking question, to which we’ve received plenty of answers, so let’s proceed directly to The Insubordination Files. “In the moments prior to the last match of the 1950 World Cup, effectively the final, the Uruguay coach Juan López informed his team that their best chance of surviving the powerful offensive line of Brazil would come through adopting a defensive strategy,” writes David Ekstrand. “After he left, the captain   stood up and addressed the team himself, saying ‘Juancito is a good man, but today, he is wrong. If we play defensively against Brazil, our fate will be no different from Spain [6-1] or Sweden [7-1].’ Varela then delivered an emotional speech about how they should defy the odds and not be intimidated by fans or the opposing team. The speech, as was later confirmed, played a huge part in the outcome of  .” “In 1965,   ignored the instructions of Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty in a second leg European tie against Roma,” writes David Warriston. “El Tel instructed Marvin Hinton to play as a sweeper instead of following the Doc’s plan for Chelsea to play their normal domestic system. The 0-0 result was fine – Chelsea went through 4-1 on aggregate – but within a year Venables was transferred to Spurs with a clash of personalities being a factor.” “There was the famous instance of  ’s half time apology to Matt Busby (‘Sorry, boss’) in a European Cup match at Benfica,” writes Geoff Wignall. “Contrary to instructions to keep things tight, with United protecting a 3-2 lead from the first leg, Best ran riot and United were 3-0 up after 14 minutes. End result: 5-1, 8-3 on aggregate.” “In the 1973 German Cup final, Borussia Mönchengladbach were up against local rivals Koln,” begins Alex von Fintel. “Gladbach and Germany legend Günter Netzer was off to Real Madrid at the end of the season and had been left on the bench for what he had hoped would be a victorious farewell. Despite the fans shouting his name, and his team hanging on with the score 1-1, manager Hennes Weisweiler didn’t bring Netzer on. So before extra-time Netzer went to the linesman and took care of things himself – coming on and scoring the winning goal!” “France were pretty dire in the first two games of the 2006 World Cup, which was probably down to the hapless management of Raymond Domenech,” opines Tom Parternoster-Howe. “Fortunately, just about the only decent thing Domenech did in his time as coach was to persuade Zinedine Zidane, Lilian Thuram and Claude Makélélé to come out of retirement in 2005, ensuring France’s qualification. Draws with Switzerland and South Korea in their first two games in Germany left France needing a win against Togo to qualify. At some point – either before the Togo game or the last-16 match against Spain – the players stopped listening to Domenech and started organising things for themselves. “Zidane was rumoured to be the driving force behind this, and if you see his coaching career, it seems highly plausible. The results and performances improved significantly. Victories over Spain, Brazil and Portugal took France to a final against Italy, and we all know what happened there. It’s fair to say that Zidane used his head throughout the tournament. It worked out pretty well for Domenech too; his contract was extended to 2010. There was another player mutiny there, but that one didn’t work out quite as well, probably because the behavioural matters overrode the tactical.” Manchester United beat Ajax 2-0 in Stockholm to win their second trophy in José Mourinho’s first season at Old Trafford. The second goal, scored by Henrikh Mkhitaryan just after half-time, came as a result of   going rogue. Mourinho had instructed Mkhitarayan to stay 30 yards from goal when United won a corner, mainly because his pace would help stop any Ajax counter-attacks at source. But he had been booked in the first half, so Herrera – whose role was to stand in front of the goalkeeper – told Mkhitaryan to swap places when United won their first corner of the second half. Mourinho started to chunter, wondering what was going on … until Mkhitaryan hooked Marouane Fellaini’s header into the net to make it 2-0. Herrera explained his logic after the game to Mourinho, who later called him “one of the smartest players” he had managed.  begins Ed Warren.  “I am old enough to remember     launching throws into the opposition box in the 1970s with his windmill arm technique,” writes Pete Tomlin. “Chelsea’s winning goal in the 1970 FA Cup replay was scored by David Webb from one of his throws. “Another early proponent of the long throw was  , who played for Wolves, Cardiff and Newport. There are reports of his ‘feared long throw’ in the mid 1960s. In the 1970s the BBC ran a televised competition to see who had the longest throw. Woodruff reached the final but was beaten by Malcolm MacDonald. “However, the earliest reference to long throws that I have found goes back much further. Apparently in the summer of 1933, when   was still a young player, he used to practice throwing balls over a row of houses, asking the boys of the village to retrieve them for him. This helped him to develop what was described as his ‘unique long throw-in’. He later placed great importance on training throw-ins when manager of Liverpool.”  we looked at early-season pitch invasions, with Oldham Athletic (19 August 2023) the clubhouse leader. Not any more! “There was a huge pitch invasion when   scored a late winner to beat local rivals Blackpool in the Carabao Cup in 2013,” writes Jeff Stephens. “This was the second game of the season, played on 5 August.” Amid the chaos   and a number of people were arrested.  asks Pedro Barbieri. We had a similar question in 2021, when   won by the same scoreline against VfB Stuttgart – except all four of their goals were scored with 10 men. Here’s a snippet of what we said back then. We haven’t been able to top Bayern’s 4-0 win, but there are still plenty of examples worth mentioning of 10 men overcoming 11. Let’s start at Stamford Bridge in April 2006. The leaders and champions,   had dropped five points in the previous three games and were in danger of being caught by Manchester United. They were in even more trouble when, after going a goal down, they had Maniche sent off. The response was awesome. With Didier Drogba at his most unplayable, Chelsea’s 10 men  , and went on to win the title at a canter. There are two other comebacks that spring immediately to mind.   were 3-0 down against Slovenia at Euro 2000 when Sinisa Mihajlovic got himself sent off. A fairytale win for Slovenia, who were playing their first game at a major tournament, looked inevitable. Maybe that was the problem: when Yugoslavia got one back, Slovenia started to panic, and the match finished in  . “On Saturday, Jeremy Ngakia scored twice for Watford to take his career goals total to three from 116 senior club appearances,” begins Peter Skilton. “Excluding players who scored only once, has anybody with 100+ appearances managed a higher percentage of their career goals in a single match?” “Mircea Lucescu played for Romania against Cyprus in 1966, and then managed Romania against Cyprus in 2025, 59 years later. Have any other people in football history participated in the same fixture more than half a century apart?” asks Ben. “Two games and 27 days after West Ham won 3-0 at Nottingham Forest, they sacked the winning manager (Graham Potter) to replace him with the losing manager (Nuno Espírito Santo). Has that ever happened so soon after the initial match?” asks David Sims. “Liverpool won seven games in succession and have now lost three in a row.

What a delight it was to learn that Big Website columnist Adrian Chiles   in his house. Spare a thought for the Barnsley fan who took the rest room a little too literally, and was rescued from a deserted Oakwell after   at half-time during a 2015 defeat by Fleetwood. “He had no shoes on and had lost his mobile phone and his hat,” elaborated a Barnsley fire station spokesperson. And who can forget when, at the height of his fame at Manchester City, Mario Balotelli   in 2012. “Balotelli parked his Bentley outside, then came in and was asking where the toilets were, then he went to the teachers’ staff room,” a student told the Manchester Evening News. “After that he was just walking round the campus like he owned the place.” Tuesday marks 25 years to the day that Kevin Keegan resigned as England manager after a brief chat in a toilet cubicle with FA director David Davies in the bowels of Wembley, following that infamous 1-0 defeat by Germany in 2000 – England’s final match at the famous old stadium. As Davies  , he had entered the sodden, beleaguered England dressing room immediately after the match, only to find David Beckham in tears and Tony Adams “fired up”, both of them pleading for the suit to bring Keegan to his senses. Following  , Keegan had trudged down the tunnel with a thousand-yard stare, and Davies found him slumped – just as he was at Anfield in 1996 – in the corner of the dressing room, muttering: “I’m off. I’m not for this.” Collaring Keegan, Davies tried desperately to salvage the situation. “Where on earth could we find [for a chat] that was private?” recalled Davies. “The tunnel? Crawling with television reporters. The dressing room? Heaving with emotional players. The bath area? I couldn’t hold a vital conversation with an England manager as players dived into the water. Only one option presented itself. The toilet cubicles. A dramatic moment in England’s long football history occurred in the ancient loos of a stadium facing demolition. The impending destruction could almost be smelled in the air. Dragging Kevin into a cubicle, I shut the door behind us. We stood there, facing each other. ‘You can’t change my mind,’ Kevin said. ‘I’m out of here. I’m not up to it. I’m going out to the press to tell them I’m not up to it. I can’t motivate the players. I can’t get the extra bit out of these players that I need.’” And so,  , later admitting that he had found his stint as England manager “soulless”.

Wander along the Danube that separates the original cities of Buda and Pest and you’ll come to one of Europe’s most awe-inspiring creations, the  . Neo-gothic on the outside, neo-Renaissance within, this magnificent building sets the stage for Budapest’s captivating collection of baroque and art nouveau structures. Just a short two-and-a-half-hour flight from London with British Airways, the city is ideal for a weekend away, or a longer break, when you can take in the architecture at a more leisurely pace. One of the most enjoyable introductions to Budapest is a ride on the city’s distinctive yellow trams, specifically line 2. This runs all along the Pest embankment, giving you superb views of Buda across the river. Hop off at the 19th-century Chain Bridge and take the cute Sikló Funicular up to the Vár (Castle Hill), home to some of the city’s most grandiose buildings. Visitors can’t resist  , a 19th-century fortress with ornate towers and turrets – not to mention fabulous views of the city. Its equally ornate neighbour, the gothic Matthias Church, dazzles with its intricately patterned tiled roof and soaring spires. In the midst of all this splendour is the enormous Buda Castle, which originally dates from the 13th century and now houses the   and its vast collection of Hungarian and international art and artefacts over the past millennium. Cross the Danube to Pest for more cultural treasures, notably the  , an impressive neoclassical building housing more than 100,000 by European masters and one of central Europe’s most significant collections of Egyptian antiquities. Its setting is just as impressive – right beside Heroes’ Square, the largest in Budapest, which was built in 1896 to commemorate the millennium of the Hungarian settlement of the Carpathian basin. Here in this handsome open space, people gather regularly for cultural events and festivals. It’s also the gateway to City Park (Városliget), which has some of Budapest’s most enticing attractions spread across 121 hectares (300 acres). One not to be missed is the  , whose thermal springs flow into indoor and outdoor pools set within a fantastically lavish neo-baroque complex painted in vivid yellow. Wallowing in thermal baths is a Hungarian pastime as important as stopping for a coffee, a cake and a good gossip in a coffeehouse, and Széchenyi is one of the most delightful places to soothe the body and spirit. If you’re in Buda, you could take in the  , which has a 16th-century Turkish bath as its centrepiece, as well as a contrasting modern rooftop pool overlooking the Danube. Don’t be in too much of a rush to leave City Park, however. In the summer, go boating on City Park Lake.

Under an undulating roof surrounded by trees, it combines a music museum with an open-air stage, concert halls and exhibition spaces – typical of the creative spirit that flows through the city. As you make your way back towards the centre of the city, you’ll walk along Budapest’s grandest avenue, Andrássy Avenue, which combines stately villas with major cultural institutions including the grand  . Shoppers know Andrássy Avenue as the place to browse luxury boutiques such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci. Throughout this district runs bustling Váci Street, the main pedestrianised artery lined with shops and restaurants. Head to the Central Market Hall, whose stalls showcase mouthwatering local produce in a splendid neo-gothic hall. Or, alternatively, make the most of the city’s burgeoning Michelin-starred restaurant scene. You’ll find a two-star venue in modern Hungarian, Stand and six one-star offerings, from Salt to Borkonyha Winekitchen. There are also Bib Gourmand options in Goli (the nickname locals gave to the historic building), with its Mediterranean and Middle Eastern mix, and N28 Wine and Kitchen, where 95% of the wines are Hungarian. In the midst of buzzing Pest is another of Budapest’s architectural highlights, the imposing 19th-century  .

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/10/thomas-tuchel-england-crowd-quiet-football-daily-newsletter", "content": "Not a lot of people know this, but Brian Clough never managed the England football team. Despite winning two Bigger Cups, two league titles and a few Milk Cups, Clough was overlooked for Big Job, largely because the prevailing blazers were terrified of his unyielding attitude regarding the administration of home truths. Clough as England manager is one of football’s great what-ifs. We’ll never know, no matter how many times it comes up on the Stick to Football podcast, but Thomas Tuchel is starting to give us a glimpse into what it might have been like. We know these are different times. Tuchel will never rock a green jumper, and we’re not expecting him to stroll on to the field and start panelling his own fans like Clough once did. But he shares Clough’s disdain for the veneers and unchallenged horse pucky that are fundamental to the preservation of football’s warped self-image. And he has a powerful urge to say the unsayable. Never mind empowering the Three Lions; so far Tuchel has spent his time slaying sacred cows. Not content with calling out – and leaving out – many of his star players, or challenging the media on their sometimes infantile interpretation on his decisions, Tuchel   after Thursday’s  . “The stadium was silent,” he said. “Silent. We never got any energy back from the stands. What more can you give [the fans]? Twenty minutes, three goals. The way we attacked Wales and we didn’t let them escape. If you hear for half an hour [it was] just Wales fans. It’s a bit sad because I think the team deserved big support.” It’s not simply the case that football support was better in the olden days – a cherubic Football Daily was one of only 21,342 who turned up at Wembley to watch Paul Gascoigne book his place in England’s Italia 90 XI, never mind the squad, in a 4-2 win over Czechoslovakia in 1990, and yes this aside is essentially just a gratuitous assertion of our authenticity – but in a broader sense it’s hard to argue there are more libraries in English football than ever before. It doesn’t help that the England supporter songbook could be printed on a few A6 pages, or that the most popular songs aren’t about football anyway. Tuchel’s reluctance to play politics is extremely refreshing – and pretty risky, because it won’t take much for people to turn on a  . It’s barely a month, after all, since the majority were affronted by England’s inability to put a gazillion past Andorra. Tuchel is both exceedingly smart and occasionally spiky – it’s hard to be certain which is behind his unorthodox decision to set up an industrial feather-ruffler in the bowels of Wembley Stadium. Given the decisive matches of his reign will be played in America, the risk:reward ratio for the criticism felt less favourable than the still controversial decision to reward players based on performance rather than popularity or status. Tuchel’s radical honesty has at least enlivened what would otherwise be an interminable lead-in to the World Cup. And though the reality is more nuanced, its success or otherwise will be determined by England’s results next summer. One way or another, when the final whistle is blown in England’s final World Cup game, their supporters will not be silent.

Attendances were in steep decline in this decade. West Brom’s average gate in 1985-86 was 12,164; Villa’s was 15,237. The lock out one hour before kick off was never going to happen. Surely therefore a case of ‘false memory syndrome’ on the part of Mr Davies? Yours in the spirit of Noble Francis” – Richard Worrall.

The clubs would be a focal point for local people to come together and watch football on Saturday afternoons. As money and television have changed the game, supporters have become a secondary concern and Saturday afternoon kick-offs, especially in the Premier League, have become a rarity rather than the norm. In response to these developments, supporters formed ultra groups to ensure their voices are heard. One of the most prominent of these is the Holmesdale Fanatics at  , who are celebrating their 20th anniversary this year. Leaning on the experience of fans of Union Saint-Gilloise in Brussels, Red Star in Paris and St Pauli in Hamburg, they have generated their own brand of coordinated, passionate support over the past two decades. The ultra movement can be traced back to 1951, when the Torino fan group   was founded in Italy. These groups quickly evolved, organised and spread across the continent. The academic John Foot wrote in his book  : “The   have adopted forms of self-organisation similar to those found in political groups and among social movements. The most important have offices, bars, meetings, membership, their own merchandise as well as radio stations, fanzines and newspapers and even their own coach companies.” Mickey Grafton, one of the leading figures of the Holmesdale Fanatics, says more fan groups are needed in the Premier League to create atmosphere in grounds, protect the interests of ordinary fans and preserve the culture of clubs. Soon after the Holmesdale Fanatics were founded in 2005, they partnered with The Panthers, the ultras of Panionios FC, the oldest football club in Greece. The links go beyond just sharing the same red and blue colours, with common values of fan activism and anti-authoritarianism that have led to fans attending each other’s matches. The most visible element of ultras’ activities is the creation of tifos. The Holmesdale Fanatics’ displays at Wembley in the FA Cup earlier this year were impressive in their scale and messaging. The use of the quote from the Palace defender Maxence Lacroix that “Wembley will shake and it will be beautiful” in a banner stretched across the western end of the stadium proved prophetic as the club   in their 115-year history. “The display for the FA Cup final took three full weeks of full-time work to pull together,” Grafton says. “With some lads doing eight to 22-hour days on top of work.   – money that was raised by the Palace support.” A number of Palace players, including Chris Richards and Dean Henderson, contributed. The former club captain Jason Puncheon even made his donation in person. “That highlights the relationship between fans and players that should be the heartbeat of all clubs,” says Grafton. The tifos have proven popular with the Palace squad. “Multiple players and managers have thanked us, several coming down the pub over the years for a pint and a chat with the lads,” Grafton says. “Many have told us the boost it gives them ahead of kick-off, knowing it is their responsibility to match the supporters’ efforts on the pitch. These moments create unbeatable unity and a bond that ultimately reinforces the strength of the club. Everyone is fighting together for the same goals and to push Palace forward.” Planning and creating the tifos can take more than a month. They are drawn and hand-painted in a local warehouse before being transported to the stadium in vans. For the two FA Cup matches at Wembley, the group gained access to the stadium the day before kick-off to ensure everything was in place. One of the tifos for the final was especially poignant. It depicted  : supporter Mark Wealleans celebrating with his two young sons after Darren Ambrose had scored a spectacular goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford in 2011. Wealleans died of cancer in 2017 but his sons, Dominic and Nathan, were at Wembley for the game. Neither knew this iconic image was going to be unveiled. “It was just incredible when we first saw the tifo,” said Nathan. “To celebrate his life with the entire country, it’s really special to us. It means the world.” Running the Holmesdale Fanatics is more than a pastime or hobby. “It is a non-stop, full-time job,” Grafton says. “Merchandise, travel, media, community aid, displays – it’s 24/7. We’re lucky to have our own local pub and the use of a warehouse where a lot of the work is carried out.” Other English clubs have tried to create a similar atmosphere with tifos, but many have fallen short. There was an expectation that Arsenal would unveil a spectacular display before their Champions League semi-final at the Emirates last season, but  . “These are totally synthetic, top-down efforts to try to recreate and commoditise an atmosphere,” says Grafton. “Printed displays are mere lazy consumerism: pretty pictures devoid of any meaning while attempting to trade off the authentic.” Some Palace fans were initially sceptical of the Holmesdale Fanatics and their relationship with the club has fluctuated over the years. “There will be actions the club may not agree with, but this is natural for an ultras group with freedom of expression and speech,” says Grafton. “Some of these may cause the club embarrassment or openly criticise the club’s hierarchy, but the terraces should be places of expression for fans to speak truth to power as well as celebrate their cultures. Ultimately, for the 1% that clubs don’t agree with, they must accept this for the 99% of positives that ultra groups bring.” “We’ve proven the benefits of an English ultras group and that it can be done,” says Grafton. “But it has to be done right and based on deep-rooted principles, not just singing sections looking to buy into the image they perceive happens abroad.” In the last few months, much of the Holmesdale Fanatics’ ire has been directed towards Uefa after its decision to demote  . The founders of the Football League – and the deeply religious McGregor – may not have been keen on the sight of the Holmesdale Fanatics in full flow, clad in all-black singing “Fuck Uefa” to the relentless beat of drums. But he would have appreciated their desire to stand up for ordinary fans.", "tags": ["the", "football", "mine", "crystal", "palace", "conference", "league", "art", "features"]},

To find yourself submerged in a vast rolling wave of information in the course of  . As English football enters   it is a little startling to think we have had only 70 Premier League matches to this point, with 310 more still to go through the slog of autumn into spring. Seven rounds of games? Really? Is that all? If it feels like more, this is to some extent a function of the Bald Fraudification of English football, the acceleration of the narrative arc. Careers must now rise and fall at alarming speed. The dominance of social media has created this relentlessly overstimulated hive-mind, a networked conversation that must always happen, that rewards and promotes the loudest and most scandalised voice. As an example – and in fact the source of the original term – it is now axiomatic that there must always be at least two Bald Frauds operating in the Premier League at any given time, a non-negotiable that created its own lovely moment of synergy   as Enzo Maresca literally passed the Bald Fraud Baton – an actual baton – to Arne Slot in the course of their post-match handshake. One obvious consequence is that nobody seems to like an international break much these days. This is logical. The product is designed to be consumed in constant rotation, an addiction fed to a strict schedule. But it is still a timely moment of cold turkey, with the league frozen at an unusually interesting point. Liverpool are off the top, having dominated since last September. Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Everton, Sunderland and Tottenham are among the top nine. So what is the story of the season so far? At this early stage it is perhaps more useful to identify what isn’t. Some narrative-busting first (disclaimer: narrative may turn out to be true; short-term crisis meter can go up as well as down). Most notably Manchester United are in a terminal state of freefall. Ruben Amorim is no more than a pair of trainers and a spiffy zip-up jacket that has somehow worked out how to do a sexy cackle. Or … Manchester United are also six points off the top. They fielded an actual reliable goalkeeper on Saturday and kept a first clean sheet. Benjamin Sesko has two in two. Exiting the Carabao Cup plus no European games may turn out to be quite handy from here. Other myths that may or may not be myths. Ange Postecoglou is the victim of a media narrative. Reality: Postecoglou is the victim of numbers, mainly losing 30 of his past 49 league games. Bournemouth are doomed‑adjacent, but actually not doomed at all. Brentford were doomed then became not doomed, then may be doomed again, a fitting state of paradox for a club coached by a man with the brow, the curls and the limpid blue eyes of a romantically doomed Celtic poet but who is still called Keith Andrews, rather than, say, Kavan Bismarckius De La Gallway. The main takeaway, and an object of genuine interest, is the prominence of set pieces, not just as a source of goals but as a dominant tactical note. This has become fixed as a story of the season so far, the idea that after several years of ground-level possession fixation the English top tier is embracing the potential of airborne set plays. There was a good discussion about this on the Second Captains podcast recently involving the tactical writer Jamie Hamilton, a high priest of “relational” football as the opposing pole of “positionism”. For those not already engaged with this debate, relationism is the idea of creative, inventive attacking play, a licensed freedom. Positionism is control, strict patterns, eliminating variables in player movements. It’s Miles Davis using musical scales as a platform to noodle versus unsmiling men with quiffs fiddling with synthesisers. There is a theory the prevalence of set-piece moves derives firstly from the increased volume of matches, and a lack of time to implement more complex patterns. And another that it comes from the death throes of Pep-derived positionism, the fact there is simply not much left to control, just some last remaining apples on the tree to dice and slice into orderly shapes. We’ve done 60% possession, which seems to be the human ceiling. What have we got left? Corners and throws? Chuck ’em in the hay bale machine. Is this actually true? Do we really have not just more goals from set pieces, but set-piece-centred patterns in the average game? There are some false notes in this. The touch-finder kick-off routine is surely a gimmick, one that makes very little difference under the eye test. Brentford have been held up as a key driver of this tactical shift. Brentford have also scored one goal from set pieces all season. Manchester City have scored none. But there are obvious shifts. Goals from set pieces have increased overall, according to stats from WhoScored. So far they account for 45 of 182 scored, or 26%, up from 18% last season and 19% the season before. Goals from corners, Opta stats show, are up to 0.49 per game, from 0.36 last season and about 0.41 on average across the three seasons before that. Throw-ins are the big growth area. Last season total goals from throws more than doubled on the recent norm, up to 20 from a flat eight or nine. So far this season eight have been scored, on target to hit a giddy 32 if that rate is maintained. Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion It isn’t hard to see why. Long throws direct into the opposition penalty area are running at two and a half times as many per game compared with the previous four seasons. Will people stop being surprised and work out how to defend them? Probably. Will arms get tired, distances drop, fast bowler-style back injuries become a new problem? Is this even surprising or significant if people are simply throwing the ball into the box more in any case? Is the uplift in goals scored this way really meaningful, given the amount of additional time spent coaching it? Would you just score more in breakaways if you coached that instead? As ever, lumping all 20 teams into the same trend is simplistic. There is variation within any group. And here the overall number is boosted by a few outliers. Of possession‑based teams only Arsenal and Chelsea (seven and five) have really scored a lot of set‑piece goals this season. Had Arsenal and Chelsea scored set pieces at their usual rate the league would be running at 20% of all goals, its usual ratio. These two are, so far, skewing the headline number. But two things do stand out from those seven rounds of games, and the blizzard of maybe-yes-not-sure numbers. The more powerful, top‑of-the-table teams are using this tactic more, which also explains why Thomas Tuchel is so attuned to it. These are the games he watches more, and with which he wishes to associate his England team. More broadly, and the second point here, is that the bigger, more possession-based teams are going long more often. Overall long balls are up after a brief lull, although the combined per-game total of the 20 clubs is 997 compared with 969 last season. City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs and Liverpool are playing on average a combined 226 long balls per game, compared with 203 last season. Anecdotally, on the neck-crick test, less time is being spent staring at the penalty area of the dominant team while a goalkeeper does Cruyff turns, or watching centre‑backs act as playmakers. There is more willingness to go forward quicker, to attempt to score from two or three passes. This is something Brentford really have excelled at, transforming a phase of open play into a set piece in itself, the moment their opponents push on to them the trigger for a sudden long pass in search of quick‑breaking forwards. Erling Haaland is still scoring most of Manchester City’s goals, but doing so from different angles, breakaways, goal-bound charges with the ball at his feet. The addition of more direct transitions is a fun note of variation. It also reflects other elements at the top of the league. The signing of Florian Wirtz has raised some tremors, an apparently ill-fitting player in the current structure. But this is deliberate, as Arne Slot has pointed out, an attempt to find new angles and patterns as the league evolves. So there you have it: what may or may not be happening, a series of maybe-stats and vibe-based hunches on the outline numbers. It remains a key part of the game’s indissoluble appeal that it remains so hard to read, a set of endlessly complex variables that will no doubt have shifted again by the time the next international break swings around. But England’s manager is right in one obvious sense. Even getting it launched seems to have found a fresh angle in the mini-age of the throw-in, the intrusion of the hand, now, into the game of feet.", "tags": ["premier", "league", "features"]},

Crack out the cautiously decanted champagne. This is a game that will perhaps be remembered above all for Enzo’s Run. With 95 minutes on the clock, as Chelsea’s 18-year-old substitute Estêvão Willian scored the winning goal even before the shared intake of air around Stamford Bridge had been transformed into a barrelling roar, Enzo Maresca was off, sprinting down his touchline at astonishing speed, and showing classical form, hands carving the air, knees high, like a small, bald track-suited Allan Wells, then leaping with his players into the crowd. Maresca had been weirdly animated all game, out there in full-figure hugging Galactic Jade club nylons and sculpted quilted coat, bristly, bald, even quite twinkly, like an ageing Jedi on his way to the gym. As Chelsea took the lead in the first half he even tried to conduct the crowd, demanding more noise, more heat, albeit with something oddly accusatory in his gestures. Eventually Maresca returned from the mosh pit. He was sent off for his touchline run, an act of entirely alien positional insurrection from the most deathly of systems-managers. He disappeared, replaced by a generic baldy-beardy man from his stable of back-ups, and didn’t appear again at the end. Perhaps the rumours are true and Maresca just kept running, out of the ground and down the Fulham Road, passing Whitechapel by the time the sprinklers came on. But then, this was momentous game in many ways. Mainly for  . Perhaps there will be relief of sorts. Either way the rabbits that have been rustling in the tree line for the past six weeks have finally come gambolling out into the paddock. Liverpool have lost three games in a row, two on successive league weekends. They are not, repeat not, top of the table. This had to happen some time. It has been over a year now, the morning of 24 September 2024, since the last time last Arne Slot’s team weren’t at least level on points at the top. And by the end   felt like a comprehensive status report on this team, its obvious strengths and its obvious flaws, the fact it seems every week now to be playing both its opponents and the glitches and snags in its own system. Is this a crisis? Playing badly and winning in late season is a thing. Playing badly and winning in early season. Well, then you’re just playing badly. But if it is a crisis it’s quite an attractive one, a team that is still chugging along in the middle lane even as Slot works furiously under the bonnet. What will bother Slot is the way opposition managers are taking it in turns to pick at those holes, to work him out a little in advance,  , and as Maresca did here. Stamford Bridge had been chilly, grey and breezy at kick-off, the kind of day that seems always to be trying to get inside your shirt or up your sleeve. Maresca’s initial success came from playing Malo Gusto in midfield, creating a suffocating central block. Liverpool were squeezed and hurried. Every time Alexis Mac Allister took the ball in deep areas Gusto was all over him, man-marking the fulcrum, choking Liverpool at source. With 15 minutes gone neither team had created a chance. Then something out of the box happened. Moisés Caicedo found time and space on the ball, empty grass ahead of him. He took two more steps. Still nothing. Virgil van Dijk ran to his left apparently reacting to some swarming sense of danger. Presumably Van Dijk hasn’t watched Chelsea much. But it was enough. Caicedo had had time to set himself and shoot right to left into the top corner, a wonderfully pure strike, still rising as it clanged the metal strut that holds the net. After that the system continued to work in the same way. Liverpool had two shots by half-time, none on target. You want to know what really gets to Maresca, what fills his legs with dynamite? Elite stifling. High-end interruption. And Chelsea did it here. Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion If that first half showcased Maresca’s ability to set these traps where there is no urgency to drive the game forward, it also showed why Liverpool signed Florian Wirtz. Slot had spoken before this game about the need for a different kind of midfielder. Wirtz came on at the break and almost immediately found Mohamed Salah with a lovely spinning touch. Salah fired wide, weirdly, as he did often here, so blunt in his shooting you half expected to look down and notice he was playing in flippers. Liverpool were better. Wirtz had a good spell. Chelsea went into random player generator mode, blue shirts hobbling off to the recycling plant to be broken down into parts and sent out again as João Philly-Cheese-Steak, promising non-specific defensive utility shield. Cody Gakpo got the equaliser. Chelsea came on strong at the end. Reece James was supreme, in full defensive warrior mode. And Chelsea deserved to win overall. Liverpool looked muddled, albeit still groaning with talent and trapped energy. It is surely good for the league Liverpool are not top of the table in this state, that it isn’t possible to simply restock your attacking silos and march on seamlessly, that the reactions of your opponents are more nuanced. The question remains. Are they now in crisis? Again, not the worst kind. There is a huge depth of talent to be explored. But there are also creaking parts. Right-back is a problem. Right-back refers pain into the midfield. Wirtz has affected the attacking balance, also the space behind him. This is like a combination boiler where a buildup of flange in your dredge capacitor is causing overheated trex to enter the z-bend via the shuffle valve. Separately, and dating back to last season, Salah has dropped off a cliff. He was fouled a lot here, bounced up, but also couldn’t assert his own energy. He has three goals in 21 games in the league from open play. He isn’t the problem. But he also isn’t the solution right now. This is not quite a crisis. But it is an opportunity for Arsenal, for the rest of the field. And for Slot too, to find answers to the tactical misfires, to fix this team on the hoof. Liverpool are a rejig away from looking like a very potent attacking team, if not perhaps a totally solid one. It feels at least, as we had into anther two-week international embalmment, as though the league is really starting in earnest.", "tags": ["chelsea", "liverpool", "football", "tactics", "arne", "slot", "analysis"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/07/club-world-cup-injury-trail-chelsea-arsenal-real-madrid-fifa", "content": "ole Palmer and Ousmane Dembélé looked great when they were photographed sitting on Top of the Rock on the eve of the   final but it is not being wise after the event to suggest that both might have been better off spending their summer lying on sunbeds. Top players struggling with fitness issues was foreseeable before the first edition of Fifa’s expanded tournament took place. “The worst idea ever,” was Jürgen Klopp’s take, citing concerns over the long-term impact of squeezing even more football into an ever expanding calendar. “Last year it was the Copa [América] and the European Championship, this year it’s the Club World Cup, next year it’s the World Cup. That means no recovery for the players involved.” It was not the wildest of predictions. The schedule was already under strain because of fixture congestion caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2022 World Cup taking place in winter and the Champions League increasing in size. Fifpro, the global players’ union, has repeatedly warned about rising injuries and player burnout. The response, though, has been more football than ever. The authorities do not take players and managers seriously. The danger is that the best have nothing left in the tank when the World Cup – expanded to 48 teams for the first time, remember – takes place in Canada, Mexico and the US next year. Palmer is the obvious example. The 23-year-old was the inspiration for Chelsea at the Club World Cup,   in the final, but he has barely been seen this season. The suspicion is that Palmer has played too much. He has been troubled by a groin injury for a year and although there is yet to be any indication that the forward requires surgery it is hard not to feel that he is, as Arsène Wenger used to say of Jack Wilshere, in the red zone. That should be cause for alarm. A Chelsea or England game without Palmer is a diminished experience. He is an outrageous talent but everyone has physical limits. It is absurd that Palmer has gone three consecutive summers without a proper rest. He helped England Under-21s to win the European championship in 2023, was prominent when the senior side   and was still turning out for Chelsea until the middle of July last season. When is it too much? Palmer played 57 games for club and country in the 2023-24 season, his first full year as an established international and Premier League player. He skipped the league phase of the Conference League last season but was involved in the knockouts and was man of the match when   in the final at the end of May. The PSG game was Palmer’s 55th of the season. He had also represented England in their World Cup qualifier against Andorra at the start of June. So don’t be surprised that Palmer has missed a host of games this season. His is a longstanding problem but it surely could have been dealt with if he had been allowed a holiday last summer. This is not a controversial point. There was no special treatment for Chelsea, who had a compressed, two-week pre-season. The PSG game was on 13 July and Palmer started when a weary, undercooked Chelsea opened the campaign by   on 17 August. Enzo Maresca was at a loss to predict how the extra workload and lack of preparation time would affect his players. By now, though, it is clear that   are struggling. Levi Colwill tore an anterior cruciate ligament on the first day of pre-season. Liam Delap ripped a hamstring against Fulham, Dário Essugo has had surgery on a thigh injury. Tosin Adarabioyo and Andrey Santos are injured. Moisés Caicedo, Enzo Fernández and João Pedro are playing through the pain barrier. Fifpro’s annual   concluded that players who competed in the Club World Cup after completing a domestic league campaign were among hundreds at the top of the men’s game who did not have adequate pre-seasons, hurting performance levels and increasing the risk of injury. Last week Maresca said in relation to the volume of injuries at Chelsea and PSG: “Probably it’s some consequences from the Club World Cup.” Will anyone listen? Arsenal’s Noni Madueke, who left Chelsea after the Club World Cup semi-final, is out for two months with a knee injury. PSG were without Marquinhos, Kvara Kvaratskhelia, Désiré Doué and Dembélé when they beat Barcelona last week. João Neves and Fabián Ruiz have also had injury issues. PSG were back in action in the Uefa Super Cup on 13 August. The show goes on. Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Also not on the stage at the moment, though, are Real Madrid’s Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jude Bellingham. Alexander-Arnold came off a draining title-winning season with Liverpool, signed for Madrid, featured in their run to the last four of the Club World Cup and is out with a torn hamstring. Thomas Tuchel was saying in May that Bellingham should have had surgery on a shoulder injury. The procedure was put off, though, with the demands of the schedule leading another young player to grit his teeth and keep going. Why deny it? Some people have noticed that players not involved in the Club World Cup have also had injuries. This is not an adequate defence for the Club World Cup. Players will get injured. Injuries and fatigue have been on the rise. It still feels inadequate when authorities are shoving in more games, in essence jeopardising the product they wish to sell. The football, remember, is not better if the best players are missing or exhausted. And yes, Igor Jesus played for Botafogo at the Club World Cup and has since looked promising for Nottingham Forest. Yet Botafogo had not played a full season before entering the tournament and went out in the last 16. They were done at the end of June. There is an obvious difference with Chelsea. Igor Jesus was not playing in as intense a league. The striker had not just come off a deep run in the Champions League. Chelsea are even at a disadvantage to PSG, who are by far the richest club in France and are not placed under as much pressure in domestic games. There is a reason why Tuchel tipped Arsenal and Liverpool to have an advantage over Chelsea and Manchester City this season. City have not appeared to be suffering, perhaps because they went out of the Club World Cup in the last 16, but Chelsea look mentally and physically drained. They are a warning to others.

The culinary scene reflects the essence of the Hungarian capital, with its combination of old-world grandeur and modern, pulsing energy. Among the art nouveau spires are opulent 19th-century coffee houses, that really have to be seen to be believed. Think high ceilings, intricate panelling, chandeliers and golden flourishes, where the literati once debated over coffee and sweet treats. Markets and traditional restaurants serve hearty Hungarian dishes, while a new generation of experimental chefs give their take on local ingredients in Michelin-starred restaurants. Budapest is just a two-and-a-half-hour flight with British Airways from London. It’s the perfect excuse to plan a city break and discover the gastronomic delights of one of Europe’s most magical cities. Weaving together influences from east and west, from the Ottoman empire and Austria, Hungarian cuisine is a reflection of the country’s complex history. Rich, homespun dishes are the cornerstone of it all, often flavoured with Hungary’s favourite spice – paprika – and featuring rich meats, seasonal vegetables, cheeses and fresh breads. Any gourmet tour of Budapest should take in the signature dish, goulash. This warming stew consists of slow-cooked beef and vegetables, with the unmistakable smokiness of sweet paprika. And there are stews for all seasons, from summery   (vegetable stew made with peppers, tomatoes, onions and paprika), to creamy chicken paprikash, with sour cream stirred into the gravy – a perfect winter warmer. Don’t miss  , a fiery fisherman’s soup served up in eateries around the Danube and Tisza river regions. Sundays are reserved for breadcrumbed and fried chicken, pork or turkey with potatoes and cucumber salad. Eating on the go is all part of the adventure in Budapest. There are plenty of markets where you can refuel, from the vast, 19th-century  , where stalls serve street food on the third floor, to contemporary, colourful  . One of the best snacks to try is the humble deep-fried, cheese-topped flatbread known as  , slathered with sour cream and garlic. Don’t miss  , a sweet, cylindrical chimney cake, wrapped around a spit to give it that distinctive shape and baked over an open fire. These tasty, truncated treats are coated in caramelised sugar as they cook, resulting in a golden-brown crust. For meaty snacks, try Budapest’s beloved   (sausage), best washed down with a local beer. You’ll also find   (liver sausage) and   (blood sausage) at street vendors around the city, usually served with mashed potato and sauerkraut. Budapest has a strong cafe culture, with traditional coffee houses offering a glimpse into the city’s glamorous past. Often adorned with dazzling frescoes and chandeliers, they form quite the backdrop for Hungarian coffee and decadent desserts. Don’t leave without trying  , a layered sponge cake or Hungarian trifle filled with chocolate sauce, walnuts, and whipped cream, or  , a multi-layered chocolate and buttercream sponge topped with caramel brittle. Prefer something a little lighter? Try   (strudel), a flaky pastry that comes in a variety of sweet fillings including steamed apple and sour cherry. While traditional Hungarian dishes hold a special place, Budapest’s culinary scene is far from being stuck in its ways. The city is experiencing a dynamic trend towards innovative fine dining, driven by a new generation of Hungarian chefs pushing boundaries with imaginative takes on classic Hungarian gastronomy. The city is home to seven Michelin-starred restaurants – from   with its central European influence and wine pairing focus to the modern European   – and a liberal sprinkling of intimate dining venues that combine rich Hungarian flavours with the best of international cuisine. Expect sophisticated flavour combinations, artistic presentations, and contemporary twists on classic ingredients, showcasing the city’s evolving style and increasingly refined palate. The perfect pairing for Hungarian cuisine is one of the country’s award-winning wines, and Budapest is well stocked with vintages from vineyards just beyond the city limits. Hungary’s rich winemaking tradition stretches back to Roman times, while the diverse range of indigenous grape varietals and fertile landscape make for some exceptional vintages. Try the country’s most famous wine, the sweet and complex white Tokaji, or combine a rich meat dish with one of the country’s full-bodied reds such as those from the Eger and Villány regions. For something a little different, Unicum is a traditional Hungarian liqueur made from more than 40 herbs and spices, blended and aged in oak casks for at least six months.

Style Of Our Own (SOOO) London – a first-of-its kind store on Regent Street – opened its doors on 5 June. Built with fans at its core, SOOO London is a space to shop, support and engage with the biggest events in the sporting calendar. For players and supporters of women’s sport, this is the space we have been waiting for. For too long, women in sport have been treated as an afterthought and expected to be grateful. SOOO London flips that perspective on its head. Bringing together more than 20 women-led businesses, the aim is to finally address the unmet needs of athletes and fans. Backed by Mastercard and founded by Laura Youngson of   – a sports company that creates football boots specifically for women – the initiative aims to celebrate the stories, style and impact of women’s sport’s biggest stars, while trying to dismantle the barriers that have historically kept them on the sidelines. “This is the summer of women’s sport in the UK,” says Charlie Carrington, senior vice-president of marketing and communications at Mastercard. “From the Euros to the Rugby World Cup, fans are coming together to support their favourite teams and being inspired to take to the pitch.” While 2023 still tops the all-time viewership figures for women’s sport in the UK – no surprises perhaps given that it was a World Cup year – 2024 remained strong, and was actually the most watched year for  , with 44.7 million viewers tuning in. And while the success of the Lionesses may have sparked a new wave of enthusiasm, the boom in popularity stretches across football to rugby, netball to golf, and everything in between. At SOOO London, you can catch every unmissable moment this summer with screenings that foster a sense of community – and the vibe is already kicking. In June, the Eurobasket watch party for Team GB women hosted by Sneaker Sisterhood moved 200 free tickets in 48 hours, and SupportHers Collective held a lively screening of the Lionesses v Jamaica for female and non-binary fans. The SOOO events programme is also packed out. In June, Maggie Murphy recorded the first live episode of her podcast Expected Goals, then Brighton & Hove Albion player Fran Kirby spoke on a panel, and young tennis fans got to question the legendary Billie Jean King. At the end of July, She’s a Baller teamed up with Mastercard to host   – an event that encouraged fans to try out a new sport, with a station to personalise sports gear. At SOOO you can shop your entire kit bag all under one roof, from football boots designed for women to the latest Lionesses shirt, aesthetic lifting gear to activewear, sports bras to period underwear. There’s even somewhere to get your caffeine fix, with   – a charity that employs adults with learning disabilities – setting up a pop-up coffee shop in the store. Created with the support of Westminster city council and The Crown Estate, SOOO London was selected from more than 1,000 applicants as part of the   project, with the council granting funding and relief on business rates, while Mastercard provided help with the fit-out and marketing to make this dream a reality. “The space helps small businesses thrive,” says Carrington. “It gives fans a place to find their community and makes it easier than ever for women to play the sports they love in gear which is made for them.”", "tags": ["style", "of", "our", "own", "powered", "by", "mastercard", "advertisement", "features"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/style-of-our-own/2025/aug/20/female-founder-revolutionising-football-boots-and-fandom", "content": "“We have teenagers coming in asking to get Leah Williamson printed on the back of their football shirt, and then we have women in their 40s getting their first ever fitting for a sports bra,” says Style Of Our Own (SOOO) London founder Laura Youngson. She’s speaking about the new hub dedicated to women’s sport that opened its doors in June. “You just don’t know how it’s going to be received until people start walking through the door, so seeing how women are interacting with the space is just amazing,” she adds. The immersive pop-up venue on Regent Street, which was provided by The Crown Estate, is a hub for women’s sport merchandise, kit and equipment, featuring a three-a-side football pitch, dedicated spaces for events and workshops, and screens to watch all the biggest moments of an electric summer of sport. Youngson says a space like this – in which women’s sport is the primary focus, rather than a hastily tacked-on afterthought – is long overdue: “Some of this stuff seems so obvious in hindsight,” she says. “Even if you use just a few examples from the last couple of years, like the Women’s Euros packing out huge stadiums, or the huge number of tickets that have been sold for the Rugby World Cup in September, or Mary Earp’s jersey selling out in record time. These things tell us that a space like this should already exist.” For football enthusiast Youngson, the journey from concept to reality has been both a test of endurance and a race against the clock. She says she didn’t even have a space until mid-March, she only got the keys to 245 Regent Street on 1 May, and its doors opened to the public just over a month later on 5 June. “It has been a phenomenally fast turnaround to build the space, but it really shows the agility of women’s sport,” she says. “It’s already an incredible store, but it’s also changing every week. The more we learn, the more we are changing, we are constantly speaking to consumers and tweaking things. It has been really rewarding to roll into it with that entrepreneurial mindset of – ‘it’s never done, it’s never perfect, but we’ve started, and now we’re making it better.’” Selected from more than 1,000 applicants for Westminster city council’s   project – which grants access to prominent retail space alongside rate relief, store design budgets and retail consultancy – SOOO was brought to life with the help of Mastercard, providing support with funding and marketing, which Youngson says was invaluable. “Mastercard agreed to power the whole thing,” she says. “They supported us with the fit-out and making this a reality. And honestly, we couldn’t have done it without them. Their commitment to supporting women in sport, especially in the rugby space, is fantastic.” Youngson’s background is firmly rooted in gender equality in sport. In 2017, she led a group of women to the top of Kilimanjaro to play a record-breaking high-altitude football match with  , a grassroots initiative to challenge gender inequality in sport. Three years later, she launched  , a sports company that creates football boots specially engineered for women’s bodies. “Women generally have differently shaped feet,” says Youngson. “We tend to have narrow heels, higher arches, and a wider toe box. So when we are wearing shoes made for men, it begins to create all these problems.” In fact,   found that more than 80% of female players at top European clubs suffer regular discomfort because of their boots, and incorrect footwear has also been linked to an  “We changed the shape of the shoe to be more comfy, and the next thing we did was look at performance,” says Youngson. “Women’s hips are farther apart, so how we interact with the ground is different. So we changed the outsole and the stud configuration of our boots in order to better work for the female body.” Beyond the innovative science that powers their shoes, IDA also offers women a wide range of choice in terms of design, colour and style. Female athletes – from the top flights right down to the weekend warriors – are used to walking into sports shops and sometimes not even being able to find the women’s sport section. “I remember walking into so many stores and seeing men’s, kid’s, and that’s it,” says Youngson. “I would have to ask if they had women’s boots and then they would look at me like I was crazy.” For Youngson, providing choice is about more than having fun colourways to pick from, it’s about validation and finally feeling seen. “It’s so important to feel like you matter, and that you have value as a player,” she adds. “The industry approach traditionally has been ‘shrink it and pink it’, but we have been listening to female consumers and designing for what they actually want.” Branching out into the retail space feels like a natural progression for Youngson. Her ethos is community-driven and the aim with SOOO is to foster a sense of belonging for women and girls. This comes through in the details of the venue, from the intimates area – offering sports bra fittings and a space to learn about leak-proof period underwear – to community watch parties, to one of Youngson’s favourite features: the miniature indoor pitch shoppers can use for a casual kickabout, or to test out their new gear. “There’s a big thing about boys dominating the space on football pitches, and how that presence can be intimidating and offputting for girls,” she says. “At SOOO I wanted girls and women to feel that they were not only welcome, but invited.” Youngson has already seen the impact of this sense of inclusion: “People walk in and they breathe out with this sense of relief,” she says. “It’s like they’ve found their home.” SOOO has already attracted the likes of Mo Farah (with his teenage daughters in tow), and Serena Williams’s husband Alexis Ohanian made an impromptu visit during Wimbledon. For Youngson, celebrity endorsement is encouraging and exciting, but it’s the grassroots element of the women’s sport ecosystem that she cares about the most. “Ultimately, it is a place to inspire, and to get inspired,” she says. “A place to try something new and a place to find your people.”", "tags": ["style", "of", "our", "own", "powered", "by", "mastercard", "advertisement", "features"]},

When its governing bodies let go at last, handing the reins to the horses. When the last line holding against the sport’s self-immolating avarice collapsed and all were free to just do whatever they want. When crotchety pundits were finally right and the game was fully gone. Or maybe we’ll know precisely when it was: 6 October 2025, when the Uefa executive committee   that it was opposed to domestic league matches being played abroad – while allowing two of them “on an exceptional basis.” Barcelona and Villarreal will stage an ostensibly domestic La Liga game in Miami in December. Milan and Como are to play a Serie A match in Perth, Australia – a mere 20-hour flight from Italy – in February. In their statement, Uefa took pains not just to express its opposition to the measure, but also to lay the blame for it at the foot of Fifa, whose rules it said were “not clear and detailed enough” to merit a rejection. Uefa said it wants to work with Fifa to create new rules to curb league games played abroad – presumably in a way that will not run afoul of Relevent Sports, the sports promotion company whose antitrust suit got Fifa to drop its statutes. Relevent   from the suit without prejudice, meaning it can be reopened at any time if things aren’t to the promotion company’s satisfaction. “While it is regrettable to have to let these two games go ahead, this decision is exceptional and shall not be seen as setting a precedent,”   president Aleksander Čeferin said. It’s hard to see how that can be true. This is not how precedents work. The floodgates are open. The toothpaste has been squeezed from the tube. The foundation upon which professional soccer is built, structured primarily as a series of domestic circuits, is cracked. Any game can now theoretically be played anywhere, wherever the highest bidder happens to be. Once the Spanish league – or any league – is no longer a thing that can only be played on home soil, there is no going back. We have been on a long, unrelenting march to this place for decades. And the forces that carried the sport there were powered at least partially by American money and methods. We have to be frank about that. The La Liga president, Javier Tebas, spent more than seven years working to put a Barça league game in Miami in an effort to keep up with the Premier League – a cash-churning colossus created through the American model of sporting monetization. He and others have done this because all of soccer   with no pin number, luring one competition after another. In this effort, Tebas was abetted by Relevent, an American promoter. Clubs will now be free to chase after revenue anywhere they can find it. People may try to get in their way on account of the sport’s – or the players’ or the fans’ – best interests, but they stand little chance of actually stopping anything with so much money at stake.  \n  Villarreal will play 18 home games this season, to every other La Liga team’s 19. Their fans will get one fewer match in their city,   with offers of free flights to Miami. Barça and Villarreal players – not to mention those of Milan and Como – will have travelled substantially more for their domestic competition than their rivals have this season. The impact of this in-season barnstorming on title races, relegation and promotion is inevitable. A great many people were clear-eyed about the ramifications downstream. Real Madrid – co-instigators of  , authors of the sport’s   era that kickstarted the financial arms race – sounded like the improbable voice of reason here. “The integrity of the competition requires that all matches be held under the same conditions for all teams,” the Spanish club wrote   “Unilaterally modifying this regime breaks the equality between contenders, compromises the legitimacy of the results and sets an unacceptable precedent that opens the door to exceptions based on interests other than strictly sporting. If this proposal is carried out, its consequences would be so serious that they would mean a before and after for the world of football.” The Spanish Professional Footballers’ Association  .   the   group. So has Čeferin been, who before Monday’s announcement said  : “Football should be played in Europe, and fans should be able to watch it at home. They cannot travel to Australia or the United States to see their teams.” Sign up to  Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer after newsletter promotion The European Union’s commissioner for sport, Glenn Micallef,  , argued that “strong, community-based clubs are the heart of the European sport model. Moving competitions abroad isn’t innovation, it’s betrayal”. Ah well, nevertheless. Ultimately, Uefa did not make this decision alone. The leagues made it. Fifa made it by agreeing to change its policies when it was  . Soccer’s professional ranks made it a long time ago, when they started playing domestic super cup competitions far afield, in China and in the Gulf and the United States. Whoever you want to blame, European soccer has now become fully Americanized, opting for unfettered capitalism, bound by no border or tradition.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/09/disney-plus-womens-champions-league-coverage-analysis", "content": "There was a new look and feel to the Women’s Champions League this week as live matches on Disney+ arrived. With the streaming platform embarking on a five-year deal, the tournament is in intriguing territory with a paywall, and audiences will be hoping for some   magic to justify their subscriptions. Football-wise, whether it was Barcelona’s masterpiece,   or Melchie Dumornay’s second goal  , the entertainment level was thankfully more Mulan than Mulan II, but could the same be said about the coverage? In terms of broadcasting the on-pitch action, there was a noticeable uplift with a minimum of six cameras covering every match, double the minimum under the previous rights deal with Dazn. It is some way off the dozens of angles often available for men’s Champions League ties but a step in the right direction. It meant that when Cecilia Salvai headed Juventus level against Benfica in the first half of Disney’s first game replays showed four angles, accompanied by the words of a polished Jacqui Oatley and Anita Asante. That commentary duo were among several good examples of what Disney appears to have nailed. It has chosen on-air talent with knowledge and professionalism that give the coverage credibility, with experienced broadcasters such as Lucy Ward, Lianne Sanderson and Vicki Sparks on a long list of strong names. Seeing Jeanette Kwakye, the lead presenter of BBC Sport’s world athletics championship last month and another top operator, presenting live from Leigh Sports Village added to the feeling Disney has recruited well. That said, it looks rather jarring when these presenting teams are standing pitchside with a fairly meagre-looking table rather than in a shiny, newly designed studio that some might have hoped for in this new dawn. For the Arsenal v OL Lyonnes game at Boreham Wood, for example, Alex Scott and Fara Williams – another top-tier presentation team – had people repeatedly walking behind them during their analysis. Some may feel it adds to the sense of “being there”, but to others it will have looked somewhat tacky. It feels as if the casting crew secured Tom Hanks and Ellen DeGeneres as voiceover artists, but the animation does not quite match that calibre yet, although it is understood Disney will have a studio show for December’s programme in match week six, when all 18 teams will play simultaneously. The scale of Disney’s task on match nights is vast and the ambition is to be applauded. Every game has a pitchside presenting team, with 20 minutes of buildup and half an hour of post-match reaction. It is not hard to understand why that would have been an appealing message of equality for Uefa; the same resources given to every league phase fixture, whether it is St Pölten or Barcelona. Viewers around Europe may have been a tad disappointed that the pitchside presentation was only in English, but there will be multi-language pitch presentations for the knockout stages. An impressive array of languages is already served. For example, from a device in the UK, Barcelona’s 7-1 win over Bayern Munich can be rewatched – in full – in English, Spanish, German, Danish and Polish and Lyonnes’ 2-1 win over Arsenal can be watched in Dutch, Norwegian and Swedish as well as English and French. A big tick. Sign up to  No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football after newsletter promotion Whether fans of so-called bigger clubs become frustrated at not having an hour’s buildup may become apparent across the league phase. The short buildup for a huge game such as the defending champions hosting the eight-time winners felt a slight shame. It meant there were no recorded packages, no Gabriel Clarke-esque voiceovers, no dramatic montages. No deep, meaningful sit-down interviews filmed in a dark room with Chloe Kelly. CBS has set an impressive bar on the other side of the Atlantic. Its slick coverage had a world-class look and feel akin to its men’s Champions League coverage, in a great studio where it can get the best out of guests such as Kelley O’Hara and Jen Beattie. It would be harsh to accuse Disney of cutting corners. Sending presenting teams to every match will not be cheap, but with commentary teams off-tube it feels as if its priorities are the wrong way round. Also, the lack of a dedicated post-match interviewer meant that Scott was doing the interviews at Arsenal away from the presenting table, leaving Sparks to vamp for an unusually long time after the final whistle – she held the fort well. At other games there were momentary glitches or slightly awkward pauses. The pitchside duo covering Tuesday’s opener at Turin’s Allianz Stadium, Ben Haines and the former England striker Ellen White, were slick, insightful and knowledgable in their half-time analysis – but only once the feed joined them. At half-time viewers were initially treated to a view of the pitch sprinklers and replays of the goals without commentary, before Haines’s and White’s analysis. Those were teething problems the technical team will surely resolve before the second round of matches next Wednesday and Thursday. The biggest long-term gains may come through other means: social media   forgetting the stars of Grey’s Anatomy while trying to do keepy-uppies provide the kind of cultural crossover Uefa will hope attracts more fans and grow the sport.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/09/jim-ratcliffe-ruben-amorim-fails-to-remedy-manchester-united-flaws", "content": "he word from Manchester United insiders is that Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s headline-hogging declaration that   to judge Ruben Amorim is merely Sir Jim being Sir Jim, the self-made billionaire showing his anti-PR, maverick streak. While the debate rages on TV, radio, social media, and in drinking parlours about the sagacity of his words, what Ratclifffe did not say or allude to intrigues as much. Because, like an anti-Rafael Benítez, Ratcliffe chose not to discuss the “facts” when assessing Amorim’s beleaguered incumbency, as the head coach’s tenure approaches the first anniversary early next month. Instead, United’s largest minority owner reached for the easy punchbag of the media to opt out of facing the hard truth of the team under Amorim. Discussing the 40-year-old’s position, Ratcliffe said: “You can’t run a club like   on kneejerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.” Fair enough, except Ratcliffe would struggle to name any football scribe who leads United’s training sessions, selects the XI and sticks to a rigid 3-4-3 that has drawn a desultory 20 wins and 21 losses from 50 games, as Amorim has. Or who turned up for the opening fixture of the season against a serious title contender (Arsenal) in a pickle over who should be his No 1 goalkeeper despite signalling discontent last April with the incumbent (André Onana). Result: Altay Bayindir, in for the Cameroonian, was culpable for  . And, also, failed to recruit an elite No 6, leaving Casemiro’s ageing legs and Manuel Ugarte’s untrusted ones to service the United engine room until the winter window, at least. Amorim is being scrutinised by the media, pundits, United fans and other enthusiasts because of his track record at United. What will influence Ratcliffe is the financial bottom line – the lingua franca of the Ineos billionaire and the six Glazer siblings who collectively are United’s majority owners. So far, so bad.   by Tottenham meant no Champions League football this season and the loss of about £100m from competing in the blue-riband tournament. The all-time Premier League low finish of 15th yielded £136.2m from the cash-soaked competition, but that was a near £50m – or the best part of a Matheus Cunha – less than Liverpool’s £174.9m cash prize for taking the title. If this trend of failure to claim a trophy and plunging league form continues the plug will surely be pulled on Amorim by Ratcliffe, the head of football policy, far sooner than three years. After a summer net spend of about £170m (signing Cunha, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Senne Lammens and Diego Léon) United were supposed to hit the ground running. Instead, three losses (to Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford), three wins (against Burnley, Chelsea and Sunderland) and a draw at Fulham can be characterised as a faltering start, at best, and the 12-11 Carabao Cup penalty shootout   was a farrago, the poorest/most unprofessional United display witnessed by these eyes in 13 years as the club correspondent. Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion On the back of all this, the question keeps coming: are there signs of a revival; of the odd green shoot that can be clung on to by Amorim, Ratcliffe and United supporters? The answer, politely, is: how can there be until two consecutive league matches, at least, are won under him for the first time? After   before the international break, United go to Anfield. Do not bet the farm on him finally breaking that barrier against the champions. Consider Amorim’s run in the league. In 34 top-flight outings, 37 points have been accrued. Amorim has won 10 matches. In the same interview with The Business podcast, Ratcliffe said: “Football is not overnight. You look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.” The Spaniard did, but he had the FA Cup triumph of 2020 (his opening season) as ballast and he did not finish 15th then. Instead, the Gunners placed eighth and have since been eighth, fifth, second, second and second. Ratcliffe is said to find piloting United “stressful”, an insight into how, while everyone expects him to have answers to every question, he is human too. Maybe the job’s stresses explain why he offered three years as a mark of when Amorim can be judged. No one knows where Amorim will take the United train. But another annus horribilis – or even a poor next few weeks – and the head coach can surely not survive.", "tags": ["manchester", "united", "ruben", "amorim", "jim", "ratcliffe", "comment"]},

Winning when not at your best is, after all, a sign (™) of a title-winning side, Clive. But then   continued playing not particularly well and started losing. At the same time the perennially second-placed high-performance cowards Arsenal have an excellent defence and at least two very good players in every position. Arise Sir Mikel. It is almost as if things can change during a season. It really would be better all round to wait until it is finished and review everything then. But that would be a very long podcast. Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher might get through a couple of pairs of thick white-soled pundit shoes by the time they had broken everything down on the one episode of MondayTuesdayWednesday Night Football at the end of May. Do three defeats in succession constitute a crisis? As with any football debate it depends entirely on your definition of the key word in the sentence. Is Paul Scholes world class? What do you mean by world class? Are Aston Villa a big club? What does big mean? Are Manchester United back? OK, well, we know the answer to that one. But for a club of Liverpool’s size, given how good they were last season, mini-crisis seems about right. On TalkSport last week before  , I asked their former striker Neil Mellor how many defeats in a row before he starts panicking. He replied six. For the record, we are halfway towards a Neil Mellor panic. How that manifests itself we will have to see. But if you see a genial blond 42-year-old man running around Alderley Edge Waitrose (just an educated guess) screaming at a Charlie Bigham lasagne, you’ll know Liverpool have lost to Manchester United, Eintracht Frankfurt and Brentford. There are clear problems. Trying to incorporate Florian Wirtz, who you can tell is such a delightful player, has imbalanced the midfield. Those who watch a lot of the Bundesliga (ie Archie Rhind-Tutt and Lars Sivertsen) will tell you that Wirtz is a touch player, who makes those around him better. He links the play effortlessly, as opposed to “grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck”. This is clearly more difficult if you’re not used to the players around you. Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong are different footballers to Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold. There are also a number of players who shone last season who are not performing as well: Mo Salah, Ibrahima Konaté, Alexis Mac Allister, Conor Bradley. In fact, almost all of them. There is one glaring thing all these people have endured in the very recent past –  . It is just over three months since they lost their friend. While the news cycle moves on so fast and our pie chart of compassion that we reserve for beyond our own bubble focused on that for a few days before going back to Gaza, Ukraine, ICE, the Manchester terror attack, etc, etc, all the while these guys are going to work and their mate isn’t there. It is impossible to know how each Liverpool player and staff member is feeling on any given day and there is a great deal of projection. Perhaps Salah didn’t track back against Chelsea because he couldn’t be bothered or he was tired. But possibly his form is just a few per cent down because he misses his pal. It was interesting to hear Enzo Maresca talking before the Chelsea-Liverpool game about the loss of his teammate Antonio Puerta at Sevilla, who had a cardiac arrest on the pitch in a game against Getafe in August 2007 and died in hospital three days later at the age of 22. “The way they are doing this season is fantastic,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “Especially after Jota’s tragedy. I live exactly the same when I was a player 20 years ago. Sign up to  The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion “It’s not easy for the players, it’s not easy for the club, it’s not easy for the manager when you arrive at the training ground and you see every day that place empty. So you have to be very strong. And this is the reason why for me they are doing not good, even better than good. Because they are trying to deal with a problem that is not easy.” On The Anfield Wrap, Craig Hannan summed it up very well: “They’re still going to be reminded when they hear the song on 20 minutes, when they walk into the dressing room and there’s no one under his hanger. Even during games there’s going to moments when they play a ball and think: ‘Ah well Diogo …’ If Salah’s cried six games ago in front of the Kop it means that just everything isn’t all right now.” I have come to believe over the course of covering football for a couple of decades that there is a fundamental superficiality to everyone’s analysis of the game. We do not know how any individual is feeling at any given time and what effect that is having on their performance. Jota’s death is one of the starkest examples. We know something terrible happened and we understand what grief is. Beyond that is the intangible level to which this is affecting different people at the club. There is a high chance some of the players themselves don’t really know its effect at any given time. How the media cover this and how fans dissect performances are clearly not hugely important. At a practical level, if you bring up Jota’s death, it is hard to do it in 10 seconds and then move on to Dominik Szoboszlai’s difficulties at right-back. Beyond this tragedy and beyond Liverpool, it would sound bizarre to caveat every criticism of every player with an admission that we know so little about them, be it their relationship with their parents, if they are going through IVF, if their marriage is breaking down or whatever. The Guardian Football Weekly regular Nedum Onuoha was on Radio 5 Live the other day talking about how his mother’s death halfway through his career affected his love of the game. “I didn’t enjoy football as much. Some of the highs and the lows that come with it didn’t really feel the same any more.” And that’s half a career; with Jota and Liverpool right now, it is three months. So whatever they achieve, if it’s something or if it’s nothing, even if we don’t mention it every time we discuss their games, even if it isn’t the reason they go on to do whatever they go on to do, we should not forget that a few weeks ago they lost not just a brilliant footballer, but more importantly, they lost a friend.", "tags": ["liverpool", "diogo", "jota", "comment"]},

The two countries have been handed home advantage for the games in the two mini-groups by the AFC (Asian Football Confederation) with the winners of each qualifying. The decision, announced in June without revealing any selection criteria, left their opponents understandably upset. Indonesia, Iraq, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) expressed interest in hosting themselves or requested neutral venues and also called for transparency and fairness in the decision-making process but to no avail. In addition both home teams have six days between their games while opponents have to play within 72 hours of their first game. Oman, outsiders in Group A, have never made it to the World Cup and in July hired Carlos Queiroz, a man who definitely has. The 72-year-old has qualified with South Africa, Portugal and Iran twice but doing so with Oman would be his biggest achievement yet. “It would be a miracle in this complicated situation,” Queiroz tells the Guardian and goes on to question the decision to give   home advantage in the group. “Are there no stadiums in Japan or Kuwait where we could play? Maybe the people who organised this have a different vision of football.” There had been rumours that   and Qatar were going to be chosen even before the AFC made the announcement in June. Talk to officials around Asia and there is general disbelief that the Saudis were not told to play in Qatar and vice versa. The Guardian has approached AFC for comment but they have not responded. “I knew the situation when I took the job,” says a phlegmatic Queiroz. “What can we say? We have to play at the home of one of the teams that is competing. They put the Saudis in Saudi and Qatar in Qatar. If they can’t see that something is wrong with this, then who are the players and coaches to make comments?” The schedule is another point of contention. Oman have to play Qatar on Wednesday and UAE on Saturday whereas the hosts have almost a week to prepare for their second game. The situation, remarkably, is mirrored in Saudi Arabia where the hosts have six days between their two games. “We play Qatar and we play again three days later, Qatar play six days after, and they already know the result and what they need to do,” says Queiroz. “This has never happened before. The people that made the regulations didn’t think about this and did not pay attention. “When there is a World Cup, there is always a host and that we can understand: they pay for it, build the stadiums and all the rest. But to do this in the middle of the competition, it is strange that the people in charge don’t feel uncomfortable with this.” Oman, meanwhile, have another disadvantage with five players based overseas. “We have players in Bangkok who play Sunday but the Fifa days only start Monday so they travel then, arrive on Tuesday and play Wednesday,” Queiroz says. “I have been asking the chefs here how to make an omelette without eggs.” Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Geopolitics are also playing a part. Indonesia have written to Fifa and the AFC after learning that their game against Saudi Arabia will be officiated by a Kuwaiti. “We want a referee who is truly neutral, possibly from Europe or elsewhere, someone who has no stake in the region,” the national team official Kombes Sumardji told reporters. In addition Indonesia were due to play Kuwait in a friendly on 5 September but that was – say Indonesian officials – cancelled without a reason. Queiroz will come up against another former Real Madrid manager in Julen Lopetegui, who took charge of Qatar in May. The coaches are an eclectic mix with Hervé Renard back in charge of Saudi Arabia, Patrick Kluivert leading Indonesia and Graham Arnold, who started the previous round of qualification in charge of Australia, now with Iraq. Six teams have already qualified from Asia – Japan, Iran, South Korea and Australia as well as the two debutants, Uzbekistan and Jordan. The likelihood is that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are about to join them.", "tags": ["world", "cup", "2026", "qualifiers", "saudi", "arabia", "qatar", "features"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/08/gibraltar-luca-scanlon-james-scanlon-interview", "content": "t was almost a perfect night for the Scanlons when the 16-year-old Luca came on for his elder brother, James, to make his   debut last month against the Faroe Islands, but there was a nagging problem. “I told him the night before not to play my position,” the older sibling jokes. Only 57 days after Luca’s sweetest birthday, he became a full international. His plan was to be there to support James, alongside a plethora of other family members, but Gibraltar’s head coach, Scott Wiseman, invited him to train with men twice his age to see what he was about and saw enough to promote him from the under-21s. James is a right-footed winger who plays off the left and Luca is the opposite. “It was a shock because I wasn’t expecting it,” says Luca, who is in the Burnley academy. “I came on for him, which he wasn’t too happy about.” But James, a   Under-21s player, has recovered from the upset. “I knew he’d be fine,” James says. “The players all liked him. They all knew what he was about as a player. I knew he had the backing from everyone.” James has been a role model for Luca on the pitch, his 16 caps earned before he turned 19 last month and his international debut coming at the ripe old age of 17. He has played the Czech Republic and Croatia, whom he is set to face again on Sunday after Wednesday’s friendly against New Caledonia, and played in a momentous draw against Wales. James has gone toe‑to-toe with Luka Modric, who is more than twice his age. Gibraltar is the smallest member state of Uefa, making the diaspora extremely important to the talent pool of a country whose first official match was a goalless draw against Slovakia in November 2013. The Scanlons were identified very early and held talks with Gibraltar’s then head of youth development, Jansen Moreno. James attended an England camp but always knew there was a prospect of representing his mother’s country. “Playing men’s football was an important factor in me playing with them so young,” James says of his first call-up. “To do things that not many players ever have managed to do, play so many games internationally so young, it’s been really valuable for me.” The brothers were on United’s books together for a number of years until last summer. James joined from Derby in 2021 and Luca moved from Nottingham Forest at a similar time when the family relocated from the East Midlands, where the brothers were born and brought up. Not since playing for Sutton Bonington primary school have they been in the same team and the wait is unlikely to end this month, Luca having been placed back with the under-21s, but it could next happen in a World Cup qualifier. Childhood holidays were spent in Gibraltar, enjoying the beaches of the British overseas territory. “I nearly got snatched by a monkey as a baby,” says James with a smile of the Barbary macaques. When he plays home games for his country, about 30 family and friends usually attend. Sporting pedigree is in the family: the boys’ mother, Gabriella, holds a Gibraltarian sprint record and their father, Rob, was a British Universities 1500m champion. It is a close-knit family and sibling rivalry helps to get the best out of the brothers, who have also benefited from parental sacrifice. Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Being full internationals is the headline for the teenagers but they acknowledge club football is the bread and butter. James has made the United first-team bench once, in the Europa League  . The next step for him is likely a loan and he and the club are waiting to learn of potential January suitors. His experience with Gibraltar will make him more desirable because he has proved he can compete in adult football. International colleagues regularly want insight into what it is like working with the United first team, and there are plenty of requests for signed shirts or tickets. Luca is rare as a full international who is still growing and may need a bigger shirt the next time he represents his country. He will get his name on the   honours board at Turf Moor, joining some of the club’s most esteemed players. There is a wider picture of Gibraltar progress under Wiseman, who is making them more attractive, trying to win games rather than keep the score down. “I think it’s very exciting actually, to see how it’s changed, even whilst I’ve been in it,” James says. “I think you can see they’re always looking at how to improve as a whole organisation.” A joy of starting early for a relatively new international team is that there are plenty of records in sight. Liam Walker has Gibraltar’s most caps (88) and goals (eight) but, at 37, does not have long to go. Luca will not reach that age for 21 years and there is sibling rivalry when it comes to accumulating caps. “I think one of us is just hoping the other is going to be 40 and can’t move,” Luca says. “I think we’ll both be gutted if we get an injury because we might miss a couple of games.” James chips in: “I’m going to need all the ones I can get to,” aware his brother is in the rear-view mirror. “You’ve got a nice head start,” Luca says, “but I’m younger. I don’t like to compete with him too much, though.” Gibraltar may hope otherwise.", "tags": ["gibraltar", "burnley", "world", "cup", "2026", "qualifiers", "manchester", "united", "features"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/08/malaysia-football-rocked-naturalisation-scandal", "content": "here hasn’t been that much to smile about for Malaysian football fans in recent years, so there was real jubilation among the 60,000 home spectators upon the final whistle in Kuala Lumpur on on 10 June. A 4-0 win over regional rivals Vietnam not just kept the  Malayan Tigers) on course for the 2027 Asian Cup but well and truly confirmed they were dining back at the top table in southeast Asia. Four months later, they are still the talk of the region of 650 million people, but not in a good way. The story starts, as it does increasingly in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) football these days, with naturalisation. In January, the crown prince of Johor, Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, the owner of Johor Darul Ta’zim football club, and former president of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM), wrote on social media: “We have identified 6-7 heritage players … and hope the Malaysian government could assist in the process of obtaining Malaysian passports in order for them to play in the Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers.” Seven players from Argentina, Brazil, Spain and the Netherlands with a grandparent from Malaysia were naturalised. All seven played against Vietnam; two scored. The day after, we now know, Fifa received a complaint about their eligibility and started investigating. On 22 September, came sanctions. All seven players were hit with a 12-month ban from all football, which came as a shock, not least to La Liga club Alavés as their defender Facundo Garcés had played in all six games of the current season before that. Fifa also fined FAM $438,000 (£325,000). Details weren’t given, but the charges were that the federation “had submitted eligibility enquiries to Fifa, and in doing so, it used doctored documentation to be able to field the above players”. The reaction in Malaysia was split. Many were appalled, others took offence, suggesting the sanctions were a result of jealousy from rivals. The crown prince questioned the timing and said Malaysians should not bow down to “those individuals who are worried about the rise of  . Fight on. Be brave for being right”. Conspiracy theories blocking the rise of a team ranked No 123 in the world seem a bit far-fetched, especially as Malaysia has more political clout than its regional rivals with a member on the Fifa council. The general secretary of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) is also a role historically reserved for a Malaysian as the organisation is officially based in Kuala Lumpur. On Monday evening came Fifa’s full 19-page report. It arrived as Malaysia slept and was some wake-up call, described by a source close to the organisation as “sensationally damning”. The highlight is a table in the document consisting of three columns. The first has the name of a grandparent, the second is headed “Birthplace (doctored documents)“ and listed states of Malaysia – Penang, Malacca, Johor and Sarawak – where FAM’s documents claimed they were born. The third column headed “Birthplace (original documents)” listed cities located in Spain, Argentina, Brazil and the Netherlands where Fifa said they were actually born, namely the same countries as their grandchildren. “Presenting fraudulent documentation with the purpose of gaining eligibility to play for a national team constitutes, pure and simple, a form of cheating, which cannot in any way be condoned,” stated Fifa’s report. “Such conduct erodes trust in the fairness of competitions and jeopardises the very essence of football as an activity founded on honesty and transparency.” In response, FAM said it would launch an appeal. “Claims that players ‘acquired or were aware of fake documents’ are baseless as no solid evidence has been presented so far,” read a statement, the governing body adding that while there had been an administrative error when submitting documents: “FAM would like to assert that the heritage players involved are legitimate Malaysian citizens.” Fifa has said it is confident in its ruling and so it remains to be seen what evidence FAM produces, if any, as part of its appeal. Sources close to Fifa say they believe the appeal will be aimed more at lessening the sanctions rather than overturning the decision. And there’s more: the AFC has said it will wait until Fifa’s action is resolved before involving its own disciplinary committee. The body runs the Asian Cup and, if Malaysia’s guilt is confirmed, there is a possibility of them not being at the 2027 tournament. The players should try to make the most of Thursday’s qualifier against Laos as there may not be many competitive games in the near future. After the full Fifa report was released, the reaction at home was fierce, not least because for people in most walks of life, acquiring Malaysian citizenship is a long and frustrating process. As the writer Haresh Deol put it when calling for heads to roll: “This fiasco goes beyond FAM and football. It strikes at the nation’s integrity. It’s a national embarrassment.” It certainly does not do any favours for a country that has for a long time been known more in football terms for match-fixing and betting syndicates than anything on the pitch. For a while it looked as if that was going to change.", "tags": ["football", "malaysia", "features"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/08/nolberto-solano-pakistan-national-football-team-head-coach-interview", "content": "olberto Solano has become accustomed to firsts. He was the first Peruvian to feature in the Premier League after he joined Newcastle in 1998, and the first to play in an FA Cup final the following year. In April 2001 he became the first Premier League player to be sent off by Mike Dean. Now, in the latest stop on a peripatetic coaching journey, the 50-year-old is hoping to lead Pakistan’s men to their first Asian Cup. After taking the lesser trodden path from Lima to Lahore, Solano faces crucial back-to-back qualifiers for the 2027 tournament against Afghanistan, beginning at home on Thursday. Then, in November and March, come visits from Syria and Myanmar, who won the reverse fixtures. Solano, who replaced the Englishman Stephen Constantine as Pakistan’s head coach in July, is clear on his ambitions. “My first step is that we have to be competitive and not [have] everybody thinking about playing against Pakistan: ‘Three points in the pocket.’ No! We will try to be very competitive. We have to face every challenge in front of us. We have these couple of games – we’re working really hard to get Pakistan qualified for the Asian Cup. That will be fantastic for everyone. “I would like to play like [Jürgen] Klopp, I like [Pep] Guardiola’s style, but you need to be realistic. My philosophy is trying to build a very good team, very good team spirit. That’s very important to survive, especially when you play in the high level … We want to work really hard and with all the issues we have got we have to be together. No excuses, Pakistan this, Pakistan that.” Those “issues” are very real. Pakistan has no domestic league structure and the elite facilities Solano has seen during his professional life are not there. In 2001, a private company proposed constructing football stadiums and starting a franchise league with tie-ups to English Premier League clubs. The former England striker Michael Owen acted as its ambassador. “ ,” – football will happen – Owen said in Urdu. But that project never fully materialised and perhaps “ ” – football didn’t happen – would be more appropriate. None of this bothers Solano, who says he will select from Pakistan heritage players, mainly from England, Denmark and Norway, and by scouring Pakistan for homegrown talent. “If you search a little bit, especially in England, there’s a lot of young boys in League One and League Two in the under-21s, at teams like Blackburn Rovers and Mansfield. A lot of boys [have called or messaged, saying] they want to come to Pakistan. We will try to select the best players from around the world. “The players who represent Pakistan always say the level of the football is really tough, especially in Asia. You have giant national teams around like South Korea, China, Australia, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. So Pakistan needs to improve a lot to, first, get into this competition, and to try to compete. In Pakistan I hope the time is right so we can start working together. We like to use the phrase the people say here: ‘ [God willing].’” Over the past four years Pakistan have incurred three Fifa suspensions, two for “undue influence from third parties” and a more recent one, lifted in March, related to concerns over “a transparent election process”. That has led to a wasted generation of talent. Solano, who has an initial one-year contract, says the positivity of Mohsen Gilani, the federation’s president since May, convinced him to take a job he feels “so proud” to have been offered. “He wants to change football in Pakistan,” Solano says. “Of course, everything takes time, a few years, but at the same time he told me he has belief that Pakistan can be competitive in the short term because we have a lot of young talented players around the world. It’s completely different, but I like the challenge. I like the belief, the people calling me, to trust me. We can do it. We will see what we can do in a year.” Solano’s coaching career has taken in Peru, Canada, Sweden and England’s non-league circuit (with Blyth Spartans) before this latest assignment. He wants the level of professionalism in Pakistan to improve and says that has to come from the top, with a domestic league a priority. “We hear about Cambodia, Oman, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia – they go professionally. It’s a lot of young [players] who I’ve been training for two and a half months. You have a lot of good talent. But unfortunately, these young lads don’t have the opportunity to became professional footballers. So it’s very important to Pakistan to engage with the responsibility to give opportunity to these guys.” Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Solano’s remit has included the Pakistan Under-23s, who played three games under his guidance in September. There was an 8-1 defeat by Iraq which Pakistan finished with nine men after a red card and an injury and during which Solano was also sent off. Consecutive 1-0 defeats by Cambodia and Oman followed, representing something of an improvement. Solano and his Argentinian coach Jorge Castañeira were impressed with the fitness of their players, who had no pre-season or club football. Solano, a national hero in Peru and a legend on Tyneside, spends his time shuttling between Lahore and Islamabad. He speaks of the kindness of the people in Pakistan and has become accustomed to his anonymity there. He keeps an eye, too, on his beloved Newcastle and followed the Alexander Isak transfer saga with interest. “People loved him,” Solano says of Isak at Newcastle. “He engaged very quickly into the club when he arrived. But I think he’s probably said: ‘OK, I’m going to Liverpool. I want to win trophies. Maybe I’ve got more chances to win trophies.’ … So, we need to respect in that way.” As Solano and his staff prepare for the Afghanistan games, they have put their Pakistan-based players through a short pre-season to get their level near to that of the squad members who will arrive from England and Scandinavia. Solano wants his players to express themselves on the ball and remain disciplined without it, “because the only way you get results is to be solid – don’t concede goals, and from there, anything can happen”. If Solano feels the weight of the expectation of a nation of more than 250 million people, he doesn’t show it. There is talk of La Liga helping the PFF to start a league in Pakistan, where Atlético Madrid previously had a Lahore-based academy. Solano wants to build on the potential of Pakistan and also has an eye on his legacy. “We will try to play good football, to enjoy. It’s a massive responsibility for everyone, because we represent Pakistan. I’m looking forward to working with the senior team, to see what we have. I would like to do something, something for the people, [so] when I leave Pakistan, people will remember me.”", "tags": ["football", "interviews"]},

Few would have predicted that a manager searching for redemption and a club looking for direction would come together and produce one of the most complete teams in English football. As we go into the October international break, Coventry are the only unbeaten professional side in English football. They are the top scorers in the   with 27 goals and they have the third best defensive record in the division, having conceded just seven goals in their first nine games. If anything, they seem to be getting better; they have won their last three matches 3-0, 4-0, and 5-0. Under Lampard, Coventry have become one of the most balanced and clinical teams in the league; he has turned relegation candidates into promotion challengers. When Lampard arrived at the club in November 2024 he inherited a side that was struggling to find their rhythm. They had managed just four wins in 16 games under Mark Robins that season. After seven and a half years under his management – a period that brought two promotions, an   and a   they also lost on penalties – the team appeared to have finally hit a wall. Robins left the foundations of a top side; Lampard’s job was to steady the ship and restore momentum. In his first few months he tightened up the defence, increased the attacking tempo and, most importantly, injected belief and passion into the team. The results were clear to see: Coventry went on their best run in the league for 55 years, winning nine of their 10 games between mid-January and mid-March, and finishing the season in fifth. Despite losing to Sunderland in the playoff semi-finals –   – Lampard had laid the groundwork for the incredible team we are seeing this season. Lampard likes to take risks and his attacking philosophy is paying off. Coventry are bold in transition, moving the ball vertically and with intent, prioritising fast progression towards the goal rather than patient possession. Lampard also encourages his team to play with freedom: wingers drive at defenders, midfielders attempt incisive passes, full-backs push high to deliver early crosses, and players are told to test goalkeepers. This approach has created one of the league’s most direct, exciting sides; they lead the Championship for shots (158), shots on target (52) and chances created (92), and they have taken the most touches in the opposition’s final third and penalty area. They have scored more goals this season than second placed Middlesbrough (12) and third-placed Leicester (13) combined. Crucially, they have struck the right balance between attack and defence. “We’re playing with the perfect mix of detail and freedom,” says the Coventry midfielder Matt Grimes. Before Lampard took over, the team were conceding 1.5 goals per game; that figure has dropped to just 0.78 goals this season. They have kept clean sheets in five of their nine games this season. “We weren’t compact enough, we weren’t aggressive enough, so we tried to really prioritise our off-the-ball work,” said Lampard towards the end of last season. That shift has clearly paid off. Lines became tighter, pressing more coordinated and individual errors reduced. Bobby Thomas and Liam Kitching have been rocks at the back; between them they have been dribbled past just five times this season. Lampard has built this side with just a £3.5m summer spend. Holding on to midfielder Jack Rudoni, despite interest from Southampton and Newcastle, has proven as valuable as any new signing. He leads the team in progressive carries, shot-creating actions, take-ons and tackles in the final third. Only Haji Wright – the top scorer in the Championship with eight goals – is taking more shots per game than Rudoni. Keeping Milan van Ewijk has been just as important. The right-back, who nearly moved to Wolfsburg for £10m in the summer – has five assists this season, as many as anyone in the division. Lampard has a history of developing players, having brought the best from Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori while in charge of Derby in the Championship. We are seeing the same at Coventry. Wright, Brandon Thomas-Asante and Victor Torp scored 22 goals between them last season; they have already scored 18 this season. Grimes, who was signed for £3.5m in January, is also thriving as the engine of the team. He has created 20 chances and attempted the second most passes in the division with a massive 83.6% completion rate. There is confidence and belief wherever you look with this team. While Lampard has been careful to temper expectations, saying: “We worked hard and had a good startup, and it’s important we keep our feet on the ground,” fans can’t help but be excited by what they are seeing. Coventry’s next four games are against teams that are 21st, 14th, 18th and 24th in the league, so that unbeaten run could continue for a while. It is still early doors but, as the season progresses, the ambition might just move from the playoffs to the title.", "tags": ["coventry", "city", "guardian", "sport", "network", "championship", "frank", "lampard", "features"]},

In football, this is especially true. Such wistful recollections can bring together all types of people. A couple of seasons ago, on a Saturday night train back to London from reporting for the Guardian a match between Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, I thought I had landed in the sanctuary of an abandoned carriage on the train home. I thought wrong. Just as the station guard’s whistle sounded for the train to depart, the carriage was suddenly filled with loud, boisterous and visibly refreshed young Palace fans. Occasionally, these situations can turn nasty but after a couple of songs dedicated to their beloved Eagles, the leader of this cheerful group started up a guessing game. Reading off Wikipedia on his phone, he bellowed out a series of clubs, challenging his pals to guess the player who had played for them. Within a few turns, most of the carriage was involved. Surrounded, I’d kept my cap down over my eyes, hoping to go unnoticed, but couldn’t resist when the Palace fans started to struggle with “Millwall, Blackburn, West Ham, Galatasaray, Al Jazira …” “Lucas Neill,” I said out loud, greeted by approval. The rest of the journey passed quickly in a blizzard of football trivia and chat. As we disembarked at London’s St Pancras, the young Eagles even invited me to a rave in Croydon. I politely declined.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/10/emily-heaslip-referee-wsl-footballer-to-official-abuse-interview", "content": " player will play a worldie of a pass or make a stunning challenge and that’ll end up on social media,” says the Women’s Super League referee Emily Heaslip. “That doesn’t happen for us. There’s never going to be a clip of a referee, talking about a fantastic decision that’s been made. Football doesn’t work like that, and that’s fine, it’s right. We understand that the game is not about us, but it means we’ve got to find our own ways of being happy with performances while also blocking out the noise when people are quick to judge when things don’t go so well.” Being a referee is extraordinarily difficult, a mental and physical challenge akin to the niche sport chess boxing, where a round of boxing is followed by a round of chess. Then, there is the scrutiny. Make a mistake and the spotlight can be brutal. To be a referee you have to be made of strong stuff, embodying mental toughness on the pitch and maintaining it off the pitch. To mark Friday’s World Mental Health Day, the Guardian joined Heaslip, one of Professional Game Match Officials’ (PGMO’s) women’s select group officials and a member of Fifa’s international list, for a walk with her four-year-old dog, Bonnie, on Felixstowe beach, to look behind the whistle and explore what it takes to be a referee. Heaslip is in her second year as a full-time professional and that step was “a complete game changer,” she says. She had not considered a future in refereeing. Heaslip was a player, including in the second tier with Watford, and referees were an irritation. She was convinced she could do a better job. Then the captains of each WSL2 club were asked to be a manager in a five-a-side tournament between different stakeholders in the game. “I was a manager on the day and there were female referees there,” she says. “I had a little chat with them and they said: ‘You have to get into refereeing, it’s so good.’ All I was thinking is that referees annoy me and they don’t even know what a foul is these days.” Soon after, her local county Football Association put on an all-female refereeing course and Heaslip signed up: “The rest is kind of history.” Heaslip was juggling, refereeing on a Saturday, playing on a Sunday, picking up the whistle again on Tuesdays and Thursdays and sometimes playing on Wednesday nights too. “It was overlapping and intense,” she says. “At the time, I wasn’t really enjoying playing any more – it became a bit of a chore. Eventually I stopped playing and my weekends filled up with refereeing opportunities.” What is so good about it? How does refereeing overtake playing as the passion? For many that would seem an alien and confusing concept. “It’s a really strange thing,” Heaslip says. “It’s not one of those things that you look at and you go: ‘What a fantastic career or great opportunity,’ but it really is. Once you get in it, it’s quite addictive. The camaraderie is one thing, but I think the thing that draws me in is that every game, every 90 minutes, is an unknown. Then there’s the satisfaction you get from making the right decisions.” Part of that satisfaction comes from the planning that goes into ensuring they are in the best possible place to get the right outcome. As well as preparing physically, referees review clips to spot themes, errors and positives. Then there is the research into the teams: positions, styles of play, types of movement, favoured formations, how players do and don’t react to different things, and more. They have to process incidents with that context in mind while being ready to disregard it. At the same time they are communicating with the rest of their team of officials and with players, interpreting the rules and implementing them. “You’re working under pressure all the time … trying to identify clues and information that help me make the right decisions. The brain is constantly spinning and you’re always thinking about what decision you’re going to make and whether it is right for the game. What’s expected in this moment? Am I fatigued? Am I having to work hard? Am I in the right position? It’s endless.” Coming together as a group, be it in camps multiple times a year or online more regularly, is important. “There’s always going to be an element of vulnerability involved in that,” adds Heaslip. “We’re strong enough to recognise if that’s us on the screen being shown making a poor decision it’s only going to benefit others and ensure that decision is not replicated somewhere else. It’s not comfortable but it becomes part of the job and we’re all supportive and respectful when we start talking about and dissecting the clips.” The key is “parking it and moving on”. An Instagram account for family and friends is Heaslip’s only social media involvement, but even then the digital wall she has built can be breached. That happened after Heaslip’s well-documented second yellow card for Alex Greenwood for time-wasting,  . Lots was said in the media and on social media. “The amount of people that checked in on me at that time was quite alarming really,” she says. “It was because so much was being written. I don’t follow accounts that will expose me to what people are saying on social media so it was only the checking in that alerted me to how big it must be getting. I do have BBC Sport on Instagram and they posted screenshots of multiple quotes from different people about my decision.

The problem with new or firmer rules is that referees cannot prepare for every scenario in which they should or shouldn’t be enforced. Sometimes, inevitably, and likely regretfully, there will be some level of trial and error. “My interpretation in that moment ended up with that card being given,” Heaslip says. “What people don’t seem to realise is that there is context behind decisions like that and guidance that we’ve been given, but they react and forget there’s a human being involved.” When these storms around decisions blow up, referees have to focus on controlling how they respond to it mentally. PGMO’s department of sport psychology has grown to help and there are numerous ways referees can reach out for support within the organisation. Heaslip’s main escape from living and breathing football is walking Bonnie. “You remember that there’s more to life than people running around a bit of green, kicking the ball and blowing a whistle,” says Heaslip. “What fans have got to realise is we don’t make errors deliberately. None of us go out to intentionally make an error – it feels rubbish. The drive home is so much longer and worse when there’s errors in a game, and it’s hard to come around from them. We reflect, we learn, we look at why we’ve got things wrong and we need to remember that it’s human nature to make mistakes. It will happen, regardless of how much work you put into preparation.” The subjectivity of refereeing decisions is also part of the beauty of the game. “It’s an opinion sport,” says Heaslip. “That’s never going to change and I think that’s healthy; it’s what fans want, it brings people together, gives them something to connect over, to disagree over, and almost every decision will split a room.” What about accusations of bias? “No referee is biased. It just doesn’t happen – the brain just can’t work that quickly. I couldn’t process what colour is what or which team is which quickly enough to be biased. I’ve got too much else in my head to be able to process that. I’m just looking at where the leg goes, where the ball goes and whether it is a foul or not.”", "tags": ["referees", "laws", "of", "football", "women's", "super", "league", "women's", "football", "interviews"]},

South Africa have been a force to be reckoned with in global women’s cricket of late, reaching the final of the T20 World Cup last year and the semi-finals of the last 50-over competition, so this was a baffling and embarrassing display. Only one batter, wicketkeeper Sinalo Jafta, made it into double figures, and six of their lineup were clean bowled on a good pitch which rarely behaved unpredictably. In reply, England’s new-look opening partnership of Tammy Beaumont and Amy Jones made short work of the chase, wrapping up the match with 215 balls remaining – their first World Cup win secured in just under three hours. Perhaps more importantly in what could be a tight round-robin competition, England’s net run rate is now a more-than-healthy 3.77. Linsey Smith, who won the player of the match award, described England’s start to the tournament as a “confidence booster”, adding: “We’re not going to get too carried away, but we’ll take it to the next game for sure.” Smith, who broke into England’s ODI team only in May this year, admitted she had felt the pressure after an eve-of-game conversation with the coach, Charlotte Edwards, in which she was told she would be opening the bowling. But after England won the toss and inserted South Africa, it was Smith’s opening spell that set the tone, the left-arm spinner achieving a remarkable return of 4-2-7-3 in her first 50-over World Cup match. She took a smart return catch to see off South Africa’s captain, Laura Wolvaardt, before drifting the ball in to rattle the stumps of Tazmin Brits and ­Marizanne Kapp. “We kept it simple today,” Smith said. “I’m not your most traditional spinner. I’m not going to get the turn and bounce that Sophie [Ecclestone] gets, which is why we work together well in the team. I’m not the tallest, so I won’t get much bounce. “ The conversation I had with Nat [Sciver-Brunt] and Lottie [Edwards] was about doing what I’ve done well over the years in domestic cricket, and that’s try to hit the stumps and put pressure on the batters that way. That paid off well today.” Sciver-Brunt, the captain, brought herself on as first change and enjoyed a dream return to international bowling, trapping Anneke Bosch leg-before with her first ball since January’s Ashes series. In her next over, Chloe Tryon sent up a tame leading edge to Alice Capsey at ­mid-on, as South Africa sank to 38 for six within the opening 11 overs. Given Sciver-Brunt’s slow return to bowling fitness over the past nine months, there had been some debate as to how many overs she might manage in this match, with England opting to play both Capsey and Emma Lamb partly to ensure there were back-up bowling options. Sign up to  Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action after newsletter promotion But three overs were all that was required of Sciver-Brunt, while Capsey and Lamb both went unused, a combination of Ecclestone and Charlie Dean neatly finishing off the South African tail. Heather Knight, returning after a lengthy battle with a hamstring injury, looked raring to go. She was not required with the bat on this occasion, but did hold on to a sharp shoulder-height catch at slip which put an end to Nadine de Klerk. Wolvaardt looked shellshocked after the match, telling Sky Sports: “This team has shown a lot of resilience in the past. We’ve got a long tournament ahead of us, and we’ll be looking to put this behind us as quickly as we can. In a tournament like this, you’ve got to have a really short memory.” England’s fielding – so often under the spotlight these days – was barely tested here. Instead it was South Africa who fumbled the chance to run out Jones early on, while Masabata Klaas put down a straightforward return catch proffered up by Jones on 31 – South Africa’s best chance of taking a wicket. Instead, Jones continued to loft the ball down the ground, finishing unbeaten on 40.

It also featured an unscheduled 15-minute interruption when swarms of insects descended on the pitch.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/07/heather-knight-england-bangladesh-womens-cricket-world-cup", "content": "England survived a nervy wobble with the bat to beat Bangladesh by four wickets in Guwahati and go top of the table at the World Cup. Bangladesh reduced England to 103 for six chasing 179 but a watchful 79-run partnership between Heather Knight and Charlie Dean steadied the ship, helped by the absence of Bangladesh’s key strike bowler, Marufa Akter, for the last 15 overs of the chase. Nevertheless, the performance will raise questions as to how far England have overcome the issues which dogged them under their previous coach, Jon Lewis, notably their ability to focus in pressure moments. Bangladesh are a nation who scraped through the qualifiers for the World Cup back in April, have played no international cricket since then, and whose domestic structure is still almost entirely amateur; their coming within a whisker of slaying the giant of the No 2-ranked side in the world was never in the script. England were extremely fortunate to be on the right side of two controversial TV umpiring decisions, which handed Knight lives on nought and 13. The rules surrounding use of the decision review system state that in the absence of any definitive evidence to the contrary, the initial on-field decision should stand. Here, though, the third umpire chose to overturn an on-field “out” decision against Knight, ruling the batter had not edged Marufa behind the stumps despite the fact that UltraEdge appeared inconclusive. Then, Bangladesh celebrated Shorna Akter’s diving catch at cover in the 15th over and Knight walked towards the pavilion, but the on-field umpires were unsure and the third umpire, after a lengthy review, deemed the pictures were inconclusive as to whether Akter had grounded the ball in breaking her fall. In between, Knight used DRS to overturn a leg-before decision for Marufa, somehow surviving the scratchiest of starts – at one stage she was 14 from 44 balls – to bring up the half-century that enabled England to stagger across the finish line. “I certainly had a little bit of luck today but the year I’ve had I deserved it,” Knight said. “I just tried to ride that and make it count. “It’s my first innings in an ODI since January, so it was always going to take a bit of time to find my feet. The hardest thing sometimes coming back from injury is rhythm. It can take a bit of time to get back, so I’m delighted I was able to spend a bit of time out there and get through that pressure.” The match has put a substantial dent in England’s net run rate, which had been healthy after last week’s astonishing  ; they sit above Australia only by virtue of the reigning champions’ washout against Sri Lanka at the weekend. This should have been an easy chase for England after a leisurely batting performance by Bangladesh, who scored just 178 despite batting for all but two balls of their 50 overs. The tempo of the innings was typified by Sobhana Mostary, who – seven years on from her one-day international debut – celebrated a maiden half-century, but took 92 balls to reach the milestone. Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont both fell victim to the hooping inswing of Marufa, before the leg-spinner Fahima Khatun reduced England from 69 for two to 78 for five, removing Nat Sciver-Brunt, Sophia Dunkley and Emma Lamb. The left-arm spinner Sanjida Akter Meghla then curved one in to Alice Capsey, rapped her on the back pad and sent her packing lbw. After her own early dismissal for a duck, popping up a soft catch to Dean at short extra cover, Bangladesh’s captain, Nigar Sultana, had been seen encouraging her players from the dugout to up the pace. “I wanted them to play until the last ball,” she said. But Bangladesh’s innings only came alive at the very end – 48 runs coming off the final seven overs, thanks to an exciting, unbeaten 43 from 27 balls from the No 9, Rabeya Khan.

It was the type of uninformed query that ordinarily prompts eye-rolls in cricket’s complex spheres. But the match situation – 60 for one, chasing a victory target of only 86 – made the response quite simple on this occasion. Besides, he was just a kid; an American one, at that. How was he to know that cricket’s ebbs and flows rarely render it condensable into such binary terms? Buoyed up by the engagement, the child began asking further questions, thrilled by every minor detail he was able to obtain: the ball, the bat, the scoring process. His name, he told us, was Jake. He lived in New York and he was 10 years old.   had been his English father’s favourite sport until dying in a car crash three years ago. Since then, Jake sometimes watches cricket clips on YouTube to try to understand what it is all about. Now, in the unlikeliest of locations, while on holiday with his mother in Corfu, he had stumbled across real-life cricket in the flesh for the first time. His father’s passion played out in front of him. Jake was entranced. His were, in fact, just a few of all manner of inquiries asked by confused spectators over the course of the Sunday afternoon – from English families wondering why they had unexpectedly stumbled across a scene reminiscent of home, to baffled east Asians taking photos of a strange sporting spectacle, the likes of which they had never witnessed before. We were rather difficult to avoid. The match between the tourists, Octopus Cricket Club, and our hosts, Anagennisi Cricket Club, occupied the most prominent of spots in Spianada Square, the green buffer separating the picturesque cobbled Old Town streets from the Old Fortress holding guard over the shimmering Straits of Corfu. Anyone seeking an outdoor spot for some food in the autumnal sun unwittingly became cricket viewers from their vantage point of the dozens of restaurants and cafes that lined one side of the pitch. Spectators – if that is the correct word for an engagement span that ranged from brief glancers to entranced starers – numbered hundreds. Over the past few years, Octopus have embarked on season-ending trips to a raft of unlikely European cricketing locations. From France to Croatia, and Malta to Montenegro, a common denominator tends to be the expat-heavy makeup of the opposition. By contrast, Corfu’s unique cricketing history ensures their teams are overwhelmingly homegrown. The first fixture on the Spianada’s sward took place in 1823 between officers of a Royal Navy ship moored nearby and a team of British soldiers from the local garrison. By the end of the 19th century – with the island no longer a British protectorate – the sport had been taken up by natives and Corfu swiftly became the home of Greek cricket. These days, the Hellenic Cricket Federation is based on the island, alongside eight of the country’s 11 clubs (the remainder are located in Athens). Enduring Anglo-Corfiot relations ensure a steady stream of English sides make the trip east to sample the local cricketing fare. One of those was crucial in reinvigorating the sport when it was in danger of dying out on the island – a high-profile fixture between a Corfu XI and a Lord’s Taverners team consisting of celebrities (John Cleese and Nicholas Parsons among them) and former England cricketers (Ken Barrington the most distinguished) in 1978. The match was immortalised in the short film Mad Dogs and Cricketers, narrated by Eric Morecambe, showing the two sides, replete in full whites, arriving at the ground to extraordinary pageantry before taking the field behind a marching band. Our entrance was rather less ceremonious, although pre-match discussions in 2025 differed little from that 47 years earlier, with the Octopus captain, Sam, informed – just as his slightly more illustrious counterpart Barrington had been – that, in lieu of any visible markers, the boundary would begin “where the grass ends”.

The tourists gratefully exploited it, easing to a nine-wicket win that made up for our earlier narrow defeat in the tour’s opening fixture at the island’s equally scenic Gouvia Marina ground. As our unbeaten batters walked off the Spianada pitch, and hands were heartily shaken and pictures taken, Jake remained in our midst, absorbing all he could of his father’s treasured sport. Seeking an opportunity to offload his distinctly worn pair of cheap batting gloves that had contributed to a career average of 8.91, our wicketkeeper Ben offered them to the eager young American, even pulling out a pen and adorning them with an autograph to further reduce their nonexistent value. Jake was elated; an otherwise routine holiday lunch had turned into an unforgettable occasion. When we passed him on the way back to our hotel a while later, the old gloves with a new lease of life were still firmly strapped to his hands and he was proudly displaying them on a video call to a family member on the other side of the Atlantic, his wide smile showing no sign of fading.

And this is a plan that Australia need to work. Usman Khawaja has one century in his past 44 innings. Sam Konstas looks less like a Test opener and more like the handsome actor who might play a Test opener in a Bollywood epic. None of the alternatives has made a cogent case. Nathan McSweeney looks cooked. Marcus Harris is still inexplicably hanging around the place, like moths or damp. Meanwhile   and suddenly this feels like a weirdly lightweight side, short of authority or balance, the kind of effortless self-assurance that has often put Australia 2-0 up before a ball is bowled. Enter Marnus: a world No 1 Test batter as recently as 2023,  , the perfect character to restore order to a brittle empire. And we are told this is a calmer and more meditative Labuschagne these days: a pared-down, back-to-basics Labuschagne, no longer as maniacally obsessed with technical minutiae. “I feel like I’ve really stripped it back,” he said after his century. “Not really too technical, just what I need to score runs.” Of course, nobody truly believes this. Most likely this is a rebrand that exists entirely in Labuschagne’s own head: still furiously stripping down that technique from dawn to dusk, going more back to basics than anyone has ever dared to go before him. You want less technical? Marnus will spend months in the nets with coaches and video clips, exhaustively remoulding himself into the least technical batter that has ever existed. This is simply the nature of the addict, and the trait that has always made Labuschagne one of the most wildly absorbing cricketers in the game. Perhaps before this inscrutably unpredictable Ashes series, there is even a kind of pleasing dissonance to Labuschagne’s unquenchable obsession. In England we have a team for whom any kind of analysis, let alone self-analysis, is a kind of dangerous taboo. Feel the flavours. Be where the ball is. Smell the now. In the other corner you have a player such as Labuschagne, a man terminally obsessed with cricket and magnificently unbothered by who knows about it, who sees cricket even in the spaces between the cricket, who treats this absurd sport with exactly the level of absurd reverence it demands.

During his shamanic phase – from the moment he strode out to replace a concussed Steve Smith at Lord’s in 2019 to around the end of 2022 – Labuschagne somehow managed to   the game more deeply. To access it – through sheer intensity of will – on a higher, weirder, more frenzied level. During his days playing Kent league cricket, teammates would find him on the morning of a game sitting on a park bench in a trance-like state, literally visualising every single ball of his innings. According to Cricviz, during the first few years of his career a statistically unfathomable proportion of catches were dropped off his bat. Somehow Labuschagne had intuited what would happen before anyone had a chance to influence it. Perhaps this was why his career began to disintegrate the moment he reached the summit. There were no worlds left to visualise, just a boundless, uncharted void before his eyes. Also – to be fair – he stopped trusting his cover drive, got stuck in his crease and seemed to forget where his off-stump was. But it’s all the same thing, really. Meanwhile his coach, Neil D’Costa, reckons a focus on white-ball cricket started to erode confidence in his alignment. Good news: he’s just been dropped from the 50-over squad. Surely it matters, too, that Labuschagne is a man of deep religious faith, an evangelical Christian who believes that this is all basically written out in advance, who thus sees his job as one of accessing this state of flow, however enigmatic and inexplicable it may appear to the mortal of us. This, to my mind, has always been the main point of difference between him and Smith, a more naturally gifted player and a similar character to Labuschagne in so many ways. Smith tries to know the game; Labuschagne tries to harness the unknowable. Smith wants to define what’s coming; Labuschagne simply wants to be there, because it’s already happened. And because we can all access this flow state, you will surely have foreseen how we were going to finish. Why does Labuschagne want his cheese toastie cold? I have two theories. One comes down to visualisation. He wants to spend time seeing the sandwich in his mind before he eats it: trusting the process, relishing the process. But also, I think, there’s something in the sandwich itself that appeals to him. You can cool melted cheese, but you can never put it back to the way it was. You can put toast in the fridge, but it remains toast. Something in their shared journey has changed them fundamentally and for ever. We are all pebbles in a river, products of a current and, as much as we may wish it to be, the river never flows upwards.", "tags": ["australia", "cricket", "team", "australia", "sport", "cricket", "the", "ashes", "comment"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/10/harry-brook-admits-pat-cummins-absence-could-boost-england-ashes-cricket", "content": "\n  Harry Brook believes   would play into English hands but warned that Australia’s depth in pace bowlers means any replacement should not be underestimated. With only six weeks to go until the first Test in Perth, the fitness of Cummins remains a major talking point following the detection of a lower back stress injury earlier this year. According to some reports his entire series could even be in jeopardy. Andrew McDonald, Australia’s head coach, looked to temper those fears on Friday but conceded that, with his captain needing at least “four, four and a half weeks” of bowling in the nets to get ready – something that is yet to get under way – it is getting “tight”. For Brook, whose England white-ball side fly to New Zealand this weekend in advance of the Ashes tour, the loss of a quick who has dominated recent encounters – including notable success against Joe Root – would clearly be significant. “Obviously he is an amazing bowler and has been for many years; he bowls at high pace with high skill,” said Brook, speaking at the Toyota Professional Cricketers’ Association Awards on Thursday. “With him out of their side for the first game, from [the reports] we’ve seen, hopefully that plays into our hands. “But they have a hell of a lot of good, quick bowlers out there. Guys who can come into the side and, when their tails are up, they can plough through teams. So we can’t take anybody lightly.” Scott Boland is the likeliest quick to replace Cummins and, having claimed 49 Test wickets on Australian soil at an average of 12.6, any drop-off with the ball should in theory be minimal. Thereafter Australia’s fast bowler stocks are untested, reflecting close to a decade of dominance by Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood. Jordan Cox and Emma Lamb were the big winners at the Professional Cricketers' Association annual awards in partnership with Toyota, whille Davina Perrin and Rehan Ahmed were also recognised as rising stars of the game. After a prolific season with Essex and Hundred winners Oval Invincibles, Cox beat Test star Joe Root, Dom Sibley and Ed Barnard to be named Toyota PCA men's player of the year in a ceremony at London's White City on Thursday night. Cox, who is preparing for England's T20 series in New Zealand later this month and will also shadow the Ashes squad with the Lions, said: \"It's an honour for the players to vote for me, when it's your peers and your team-mates that really means the world. On the Lions trip I want to show the selectors I'm capable of playing Test cricket. \"I've got a crazy busy winter and there's a T20 World Cup coming up so hopefully if I continue performing I might get a chance.\" Lancashire batter Lamb, currently in Sri Lanka at the World Cup, claimed the Toyota PCA women's player of the year ahead of her captain, Nat Sciver-Brunt, as well as Georgia Elwiss and last year's winner Kathryn Bryce. Speaking at the PCA Awards in partnership with Toyota, she said: \"It was nice to find out I had won after our second game in the World Cup, so it was great timing. I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of weeks to see what we can achieve.\" The young player prizes went to Perrin, who lit up the Hundred with a stunning 42-ball century for champions Northern Superchargers, and Ahmed, whose career-best season helped Leicestershire to the Division Two title in the Rothesay County Championship. \"It's almost surreal, I'd never played in front of crowds as big as in The Hundred and when you've got a great team around you it makes it even more special,\" said Perrin. Ahmed, who took his batting to a new level with five first-class hundreds, also set his sights on higher honours after missing out on Ashes selection. He said: \"My red-ball season was great and I want to be a regular in the England team - it's more important to me than the white-ball stuff, so being given the opportunity to perform and then repaying the coaches with my form for Leicestershire has been great.\"  While Australia sweat on Cummins, England are growing increasingly confident that Ben Stokes will be ready from the start of the series following the shoulder injury that ruled him out of the fifth Test against India. The all-rounder has now returned to full training and has been building up his bowling both with Durham and at Loughborough. The question of Stokes’s fitness is particularly acute for Brook, having replaced Ollie Pope as vice-captain for this tour and thus an injury away from leading the team for the first time in an away Ashes Test. Part of his role as consigliere will be to step in when Stokes is attempting one of his marathon spells and potentially prevent this from happening. Brook said: “It’s an honour to have any leadership role. But it’s not something that I’m biting at the bit to do. If you want it too much, then it’s not a good thing. And I see Stokesy playing all five Tests, if I’m being honest. I think he’ll power through even if he has a little niggle. “Everybody in the world knows what he’s like, his character and the way that he just cracks on. That is the way that the team is built now; everybody keeps going. If you do have a little niggle, just power through – and that is what he does so well. “Because he wants to bowl long spells, that can sometimes be to his detriment. But he told us last year as a group that if he gets into a position like that again, then go up and have a word with him.” Sign up to  Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action after newsletter promotion Brook was offered the role in the most casual of ways, the head coach, Brendon McCullum, adding “‘by the way Brooky, you’re vice-captain’” at the end of the phone call to confirm his place in the squad. The 26-year-old suspected it was coming his way and says he and Pope have been in contact since. “I dropped him a couple of messages a couple of weeks ago, talking about golf mainly,” said Brook. “I don’t think he’s too bothered; he’s just happy to still be in the squad. He is a vital part of the team, batting at No 3, and we all know how valuable his runs are.” As regards his own runs, once six white-ball internationals in New Zealand are out of the way, Brook will be playing his first red-ball cricket in Australia. A spell with Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League in 2021-22 returned only 44 runs from seven innings – an experience Brook described as going “horrendously” and one he is “trying to erase” from his memory. Brook added: “I haven’t had too much experience of the pitches out there, so I have to stay in the moment as much as possible and play what’s in front of me. “I don’t know what I’m stepping into. I know [an away Ashes] is a massive thing but I’m still trying to get over that India series. To play 25 days out of 25 days was mega. That was the most intense series I’ve ever been part of. If the Ashes tops that, I will be a very happy man.” Asked if England will be returning home with the urn, Brook replied: “I bloody hope so”.", "tags": ["ashes", "2025", "-", "26", "harry", "brook", "england", "cricket", "team", "australia", "cricket", "team", "the", "ashes", "cricket", "australia", "sport", "news"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/10/long-throw-in-premier-league-brentford-dave-challinor", "content": "ou are always looking for a super-strength,” says Dave Challinor. The Stockport manager has a tactics board in front him at the club’s training ground, offering a potential cure to the pain he inflicted on opponents for years. Long throws are back in fashion and causing panic across the Premier League as coaches once again see the merit in chaotic scenes. Brentford are becoming the masters of the long throw under Keith Andrews, specifically via the arms of Michael Kayode, but face stiff competition, with numbers on the rise across the top flight. Missiles are being launched from touchlines to consistently great effect, bringing with them a headache for defenders and an extra weapon for attackers. Last season there was an average of 1.5 per game in the Premier League; that has risen to 3.7 this campaign. There have already been six goals as a direct result of long throws, compared with 15 in the entirety of last season. Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Tottenham, Newcastle and Sunderland have joined Brentford as the most regular users of the long throw. Wrexham’s Ben Tozer proved particularly problematic for Stockport during their battles up the leagues. Challinor moves the pieces around his tactics board and explains how he sought, and seeks, to curb the threat. “What we’ve tried to do is have a mixture of zonal markers and whether you have two zonal markers or three,” he says. “When we played against Wrexham we put a spare player – a good header – in the near-post area, a spare player in the middle zone and a spare player in the back zone; it means you’ve got three free players. “We might be giving up the edge of the area but, ultimately, one thing you do know with a [long] throw-in is the ball is going to go into this area [around the six-yard box]. What you want to try to do is make the first contact by having three aerial threats defensively – that gives us the best chance of doing that.” The option has always been available to coaches but, seemingly, snobbery has got in the way, with many coaches possibly not wanting to be associated with a concept used most notably by Rory Delap during Tony Pulis’s time in charge of Stoke. It is also the case that many others simply could not find a player capable of reaching the distances required. There is bad news for those who want to make long throws part of their team’s strategy. “There needs to be a natural technique around doing it,” says Challinor, and few know that better than the 50-year-old. In the 1990s and early 2000s the former centre-back hurled his way into the Guinness Book of World Records, reaching a distance of 46.35m at his peak while playing for Tranmere, in the process becoming a thorn in the side of opponents in numerous cup upsets. “I knew I could throw the ball a long way when I started playing at eight years old,” says Challinor. “You can increase distances over time but it’s a little bit genetic. My youngest son, Ellis, who’s just turned 20, can throw it a fair old way.” Considering how set-piece coaches are de rigueur in the Premier League, it would be remiss of them to discount the impact of human catapult. Having the propensity to deploy this weapon gives opponents something else to plan for. “The majority of goals are scored in a second six-yard box within the width of the goal,” Challinor adds, before making the point that, for him, it was never a case of throwing in hope. Rather, he had the ability to choose his target, helping him land the ball exactly where he desired. “In games you could see where keepers were potentially coming, so the ability to be able to throw it beyond him when he was maybe anticipating it at the near post caused more chaos,” he says. “Different trajectories were also important; Rory [Delap]’s throwing tended to be really flat, but some were looped, some were high, depending on what you were coming up against really. Different things in terms of distance and trajectories to try to cause different problems is important”. Stockport have the former Blackburn and England Under-21 forward Matt Jansen on staff. The 47-year-old started his career at Carlisle with Delap and attributes his former teammate’s success down to being a high-quality javelin thrower. A rhythmical run-up and being able to generate power on release helped Challinor and Delap become synonymous with threatening long throws, with the former having had the advertising hoardings at Prenton Park separated in order to allow him space to build momentum. The first contact of the ball and man in the box is the butterfly flapping its wings. No one heads home directly from a long throw, with the real danger coming after the initial phase. Often, in Challinor’s Tranmere days, Nick Henry would be primed on the edge of the box for the half-clearance, pouncing to great effect. Tranmere reached the final of the League Cup and quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 2000 with Challinor’s rockets integral to upsetting West Ham, Sunderland and Middlesbrough along the way. “It definitely detracted from the other players in our team because people became obsessed around [my] throwing and what they could do to try to stop it,” says Challinor. “It was goalkeepers coming miles out, it was moving advertising boards closer, it was wetting the pitch, it was ballboys wetting ball, it was all them things. It did become a little bit of an obsession [for opponents] and definitely gave us an edge going into a game.”", "tags": ["football", "features"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/10/martin-zubimendi-arsenal-spain-interview", "content": "ikel Arteta knew and so did Win. Dogs just do. “Well, of course,” Martín Zubimendi says, cracking up. The July day he walked through the doors at the   training centre, the club’s resident chocolate labrador – a therapy dog the head coach had brought in to bring the kind of calm wanted from the new signing too – was the first to welcome him. “It was lovely. I arrived with my parents, my agent, a small group, and she came straight to me, sat by me, rolled on the floor at my feet; that was very nice.” It was also the way he would have wanted it, part of the plan. “She’s a bit like yours,” the sporting director, Andrea Berta, offered as Win lent against the midfielder’s legs. Zubimendi’s dog, Lea, hadn’t made it to London – he’s hoping she will soon – but this was a good start. There was a letter from Mikel Merino and a video call from Martin Ødegaard, teammates at Real Sociedad, yet no friendlier face than this. That can help when you’re departing the city you were born in and the club where you have been since you were 12. “I hadn’t left home yet; going was a radical change,” Zubimendi says, and there is a glimpse of that here, at Las Rozas with the   team, preparing for World Cup qualifiers against Georgia in Elche on Saturday and Bulgaria in Valladolid on Tuesday. When you’re away, he admits, you appreciate these moments even more. “The climate, the language, and above all it’s lovely being with these mates – the atmosphere is great,” Zubimendi says. “But the change was what I was looking for. I didn’t have too many doubts.” Not any more, not by this summer. A year earlier, Zubimendi had chosen not to leave home, where he has had the same mates since he was three or four. Arne Slot admitted that Liverpool had   and he had listened but, unlike his teammates, friends and fellow European champions Robin Le Normand and Merino, he didn’t take the final step. Twelve months on, he did. Why wait? What changed? There is a pause. “When any proposal comes, the first question has to be whether to stay at la Real,” he says. “And it wasn’t the right moment [to go]. I stayed and it was a hard season but I learned a lot. I wanted to step forward, take that weight after others went.” Fans appreciated his staying. “Well, until you do decide to go,” he says, smiling. “But I’ve always tried to choose the right time and I’m happy with how it happened in the end. “I had watched Arsenal and I liked everything I saw, in terms of passion, youth, the feeling you got watching them. And when Mikel Arteta called me … Well, if you’ve ever spoken to him you’ll know that he can be   convincing. He’s mad about football, crazy about having everything under control, trying to get something from every little detail. He’s very clear on everything and the proposal he had was the best for me.” The leap wasn’t so great, not once he got the initiation out the way. “The worst thing in football,” he calls it; by his own admission, he is quite reserved, after all. “I had to sing: I did La Bachata, by Manuel Turizo.” And how was it? “Horrible, horrible.” Otherwise, it has gone well, although he misses Lea. Merino and Ødegaard are there. A footballer’s life is similar anywhere, Zubimendi believes, adaptation not so hard. He lives less than 10 minutes from the training ground, north of the city but with London only a train ride away. And he had studied English, even if it’s one thing to  you understand the language and another to turn up and test that. On the pitch, the  , going to a different league good for him. There is a confidence about him too, born of continuity at the highest level: a stability, a maturity, recognition now too. He will be at the heart of the Spain team this week. He came on at half-time in the final of Euro 2024, with everyone fearing that Rodri’s injury was a disaster – in the directors’ box, one Basque member of the delegation rounded on Spanish colleagues unable to believe that they didn’t have more faith – and ran the game. He scored the champions’  . And he has started 10 of Spain’s past 11 games. “I always felt that Luis [de la Fuente, the Spain coach] trusted me but when you’re on the pitch [regularly], when you can contribute, you feel more involved in everything. And I do feel that. At half-time, there were nerves for sure. But doubts? None. It also happened so fast, and was so unexpected that I didn’t have time to think. Often the issue is [mental]. There are players who have the level but the hardest thing is taking that step, finding a way to be yourself.” Zubimendi may be the best in the world in a position where even what it is called says something about how it is conceptualised: the defensive or deep midfielder is a   in Spain, the piece upon which it all hinges. When Rodri got injured, De la Fuente said the City midfielder was the   but, not to worry, he had the second best too. If few followed him then, the debate now may be only about the order. Inside the game, it had already been seen. Slot had little doubt; Arteta had even less. Arsenal’s manager, after all, is from the same city and played for the same team as his new signing: not just Real Sociedad but their  . Arsenal, Premier League runners-up three years in a row, a feeling growing that this year   to be their year, were determined to build strength in depth. “From what teammates have said to me, the problem was the injuries, that when someone got injured, the team came undone,” Zubimendi says. “This year the club has invested a lot in having two players in every position.” In having different types of solutions, too. As for the 26-year-old, he was the central piece, a qualitative leap towards a title challenge, his profile one they didn’t have. “Actually, I don’t agree with that,” he says. “Because the midfield there was already very strong.” As for the demands of his position, he says: “The pivot has to be someone who is very complete; he has to have the best qualities with the ball and without it, plus the physical capability. He has to be able to do everything. It completes you [to move]. It would be easy to stay in my comfort zone. But I wanted to leave that environment where I was with Real Sociedad and grow in a personal sense, to see another culture, another football. The more you come out of that, the more you develop. Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion It’s in those situations where you are pushed to the limit that you get the best out of yourself. I think I have a lot to learn in the Premier League, a lot to improve, but I think I can do that.” Well, if he can learn to  , as he did against Nottingham Forest last month … Zubimendi laughs. “Just my thing,” he says. Is it as brutal as it looks? “Yes. The mentality is: be a man. Go into clashes hard. It’s more direct. In Spain when you get the ball, it’s more about keeping it; [in England], whenever you win it, it’s straight on to the attack. Transitions are unavoidable, it’s harder to control. But [handling] that is not about ability as such, it’s getting your mind used to it. That’s different to La Liga but the thing that has most struck me is the dead ball, how important it is. I’m seeing loads of goals from that and they’re often what opens up the game. We have a set-play coach and we work on that practically daily. “But I choose a team on the basis of my qualities too: what they wanted from me. I have to adapt my play a bit in terms of playing faster, more direct. I’m a pivot, but in this structure I have the chance to take that step forward and Arteta insists a lot that I can play that final pass and make the difference. But I think my profile doesn’t change much. If they have signed me it is because they like what I do. They know this is what I can contribute to the team. If I changed my profile it would be an error.” Brought, like Win, to make everyone else feel better, putting them at ease. “Totally reliable,” in De la Fuente’s words, someone who “thinks more about his teammates than himself,” according to Xabi Alonso,  . It’s in the person, and the player. The son of teachers, a little less timid as time passes, he is engaging, warm company but there is no show, no desire to be noticed, just to help. As Spain’s coach put it: “Martín doesn’t get nervous, even if he’s walking along a high-wire without ropes. He’s always so calm, so in control.” “Well, I look like it, at least,” Zubimendi replies, laughing again. Inside, you’re terrified? “No, I try to be calm because I think in that emotional state I’m going to make better decisions. When it comes to the ‘caffeine’ level I’m cautious. Overstimulation isn’t good. I’m naturally calm. Away from football, too, it’s unlikely you’ll ever see me out of control or overexcited. But it’s also the confidence and trust I have in my teammates that gives me the tranquillity to know we’ll be fine.”", "tags": ["arsenal", "spain", "interviews"]},

But a cricket fan might go a little earlier, perhaps as soon as next Saturday at about 7.15am. Leaves might still be clinging to trees as yet unbothered by frost, but that is when the national side is scheduled to play its first fixture of a hectic touring schedule, and by the time it all ends the Ashes will have been decided, a World Cup will have been won, and it will be spring. For the players involved in all formats, these moments will bring a combination of excitement and perhaps also a bit of dread. The T20 squad departed for New Zealand on Friday, with the four men among them who have also been selected for the Ashes – Harry Brook, Jacob Bethell, Brydon Carse and Zak Crawley – knowing that only injury will bring them home within the next three months (and even then for no more than 10 days, before they depart again this time for Sri Lanka and from there a T20 World Cup in India). Four more members of the Ashes squad will follow along with the other ODI players not already there 10 days later, accompanied by a few Test bowlers, Mark Wood, Josh Tongue and Gus Atkinson among them, who are not due to play any white-ball cricket but want to work on their fitness. A full month before the Ashes starts in Perth most of England’s squad will be in New Zealand. There is only one official warmup game in Australia, against the Lions at Lilac Hill in the Perth suburbs, but by then few of the players should have any rust to work off. It is a formidable commitment, but not a novel one. Back in 1986 the players left one day earlier, on 9 October, and did not get home until 16 February. In the Guardian Matthew Engel raged that “the itinerary is an outrage … Lord’s have meekly agreed to a tour that treats the players as little more than air freight.” Graham Gooch, their best opener, took one look at the schedule and made his excuses. “My wife and I have just had twins, and my family commitments mean I can’t go away for four and a half months,” he said. “I studied the itinerary to see if I could get them out there but … I couldn’t make it work.” By the time the tour ended, Mike Gatting, England’s captain, was pleading with the authorities to learn and change. “We knew at the beginning it was going to be hard,” he said at the time. “We had an itinerary to fulfil and we’ve done it as best we can, but now the lads are tired.” When they landed at Heathrow, Gatting warned “too much cricket will kill a few players before they are ready to be killed”. Four decades later not a lot has changed, and if the state matches that used to pad out tours of Australia have been abandoned plenty T20s have sprung up to replace them. “That was a long, long trip,” Gatting says now. If today’s players don’t have it much easier, Gatting says those closest to them do. “It was the wives, looking after kids on their own, who struggled,” he says. “The families are looked after so much better than when we played. If they came out we had to pay for them, pay for their flights and their hotels, and quite rightly that’s all changed. Before it was horrible. There’s so much of a better atmosphere now. And there are probably only four or five players who will be involved in all of England’s games this winter, when we used to play all the competitions.” England played 30 games on that trip, including state and ceremonial matches, and Gatting appeared in all but four of them. Of the 19 full internationals across two formats and three competitions – the Ashes, the Perth Challenge (a four-team ODI tournament arranged to mark the America’s Cup and the completion of some new floodlights at the Waca) and the World Series Cup (another ODI tournament involving three of those same four teams), Gatting was one of six players who appeared in every one and eight who were picked at least 17 times. Miraculously, and against most expectations, England won the lot. “Playing for your country is what you aim for, always,” Gatting says. “It’s something you want to do. And in this day and age it’s made slightly easier because of the way families are treated and that’s so important. We struggled to make phone calls, we had to write letters home. It’s a hard trip, but going to Australia for the Ashes, it’s fantastic. As an England player it’s the one series you want to be involved in.” There are no repeats now of the experience of Worcestershire’s Don Kenyon, who returned from England’s tour of India in 1952 to meet for the first time a daughter who was already four months old. And compared with some past tours this is but a blink: when England boarded a train for Tilbury at London’s St Pancras on the morning of 18 September 1920 it started an unbroken period of 462 days – a little over one year and three months – in which either they or the Australians, who played in England the following summer, were on an Ashes tour.

Patrik Hrosovsky’s 18th-minute own goal rewarded Northern Ireland for a strong start but, after wasting two outstanding chances to double their lead either side of the break, they endured some nervy moments before Hume lifted the ball over the stranded Martin Dubravka with 10 minutes to go. “The keeper has come to clear it, and I just had to guide it towards the goal and thankfully I did,” Hume told BBC  . “It was a great night, good performance and the most important thing is the three points. I think we deserved it.” The victory was reward for a strong performance, particularly in the first half, but the man at heart of it, captain Conor Bradley, picked up a cheap late yellow card that rules him out of Monday’s visit of  . Bradley had looked like a man on a mission from the start as Northern Ireland played with energy and desire and it was the Liverpool man who sparked the move for the opening goal. He picked out Ethan Galbraith in space inside the box, and the Swansea midfielder pulled back a low cross which the hapless Hrosovsky turned into his own net.  \n The second came on 80 minutes when Dubravka, unconvincing in commanding his area for much of the night, punched the ball weakly and it landed for Hume to lift it back over him and into an unguarded net. Michael O’Neill had refused to call this a must-win, but the reality was they needed all three points to keep pace in European Group A, in which Northern Ireland,   and Germany now all have six points from three games. Joshua Kimmich netted twice to power   to a 4-0 home win over   after the visitors went down to 10 men in the first half. The opening two goals came from dead-ball situations. David Raum curled in a free kick after 12 minutes and Kimmich converted a penalty nine minutes later after Luxembourg’s Dirk Carlson was sent off for handball in the area.

The visitors kept out everything   could throw at them in a near 90-minute siege. Belgium attacked almost from the start, with Jérémy Doku continually trying to open up the defence from the left flank and Kevin De Bruyne probing from the edge of the area. But their efforts were thwarted by a committed defence and when it was breached, goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski came up with some key saves. North Macedonia lead Group J with 12 points from six games, one ahead of Belgium and two ahead of Wales. Belgium and Wales, who face each other on Monday, both have a game in hand over North Macedonia. Kylian Mbappé was the saviour as   closed in on qualification with a lacklustre 3-0 home win over   in Group D. The Real Madrid forward opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time and set up Adrien Rabiot for the second, with substitute Florian Thauvin adding the third to put Les Bleus on nine points from three games and give Didier Deschamps’ side a chance to secure qualification on Monday when they travel to Iceland. “We got the result we wanted but not the performance – especially in the first half,” said Deschamps. “Our ball circulation was too slow, it was all a bit too flat.

Isak struck the foot of the post for the hosts in the 26th minute before teeing up Lucas Bergvall for their best chance of the game, but the 19-year-old somehow managed to get the ball caught under his feet with the goal at his mercy. That miss proved costly when Switzeland took the lead in the 65th minute after Alexander Bernhardsson sent Djibril Sow sprawling in the box with a push in the back. Xhaka blasted the resulting penalty straight down the middle. A frustrating night for Sweden was finished off when Swiss substitute Johan Manzabi’s tame effort was deflected past keeper Viktor Johansson in second-half stoppage time, condemning them to a second defeat in three games that leaves their qualifying chances in tatters.", "tags": ["world", "cup", "2026", "qualifiers", "northern", "ireland", "slovakia", "germany", "luxembourg", "north", "macedonia", "belgium"]},

The head coach made radical selection calls for this camp, placing the collective above individuals and introducing the possibility of star names not going to next summer’s World Cup by   despite both attackers being fit. Tuchel’s stated aim is to build the best team, not collect the best talents, and his hand was strengthened by ­England excelling without Bellingham, Foden and the injured Cole Palmer in their   on Thursday. The German’s rationale is clear: he loved the spirit during last month’s camp and has seen no reason to make sweeping changes. At the same time, though, Tuchel is not ruling out the possibility of those who missed out this time returning next month for qualifiers against Serbia and Albania. “At the moment, it is only about the players who are in camp,” he said. “The competition is on. They deserve it also. And I am still ­absolutely ­convinced the guys who were in Serbia and against Andorra last camp deserve to be in this camp. This is where the focus has to be. They deserve the respect and they put out another great ­performance. “The door is always open for ­anyone to jump in. [Against Wales] we had four changes from the match in Serbia. We were forced to do four changes but it was seamless and ­everyone who started played with the same energy. We only had one and a half days to prepare so I am happy with the camp. Happy that we can prove another point. Next camp is the next nomination.” It was put to Tuchel that his logic in rewarding those who are ­performing for him now will make it hard for outcasts to earn recalls. “Let’s play a second game and then we decide,” he replied. “The nomination comes and then there is always an open door for top quality, top characters. We are in October now so we go step by step.” Tuchel was asked whether he could imagine putting Bellingham, Foden and Palmer on the bench at the World Cup. “You think too much,” he said. “You imagine too much. I am sorry but I don’t follow that mindset. With all of this I would say: ‘Let’s cross the river when we are at the river.’ It does not help anyone if we think in bubbles about what can happen and about what cannot happen.” Declan Rice, the captain against Wales, believes the big names will return. “Every time you play for ­England, you want to grab the shirt, you want to grab your chance,” the midfielder said. “But we do miss Jude, for sure. We miss Phil, we miss Cole, we miss loads of players for ­reasons that the manager’s ­obviously said.

Tuchel sought to play down his comments about England’s fans   during the Wales game.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/10/flag-alert-gary-neville-orwell-english-patriot", "content": "t the far end of the food counter a group of men were pledging allegiance to the flag, with trays balanced in one hand, in order to be allowed to take seats at the table. A group that had arrived earlier was singing The Star-Spangled Banner in order that they might use the salt and pepper and ketchup there.” Welcome to our own Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade, another real-time demonstration of the fact every satirical absurdity described in Catch-22 has become, yeah, pretty much totally plausible. The nation is now fully hostage to bad actors and phoney rage. And as ever football must act as a key amplifier of all this, a public echo chamber for the anxieties of what we must, out of a sense of duty, still call the real world. It took eight minutes for the crowd at Wembley on Thursday night to demonstrate that they have finally moved on from chanting Keir Starmer is a wanker. Instead they chanted   is a wanker. Two days earlier Joey Barton, who exists in the public consciousness solely because of football, published a video to his 2.7 million X followers in which he said he would punch a disabled person in a wheelchair if they suggested a union flag should not be flown over a building site. To be fair, this does seem an unlikely scenario. Perhaps there could be an interim stage where the two of them try to have a chat about it first. But no. Joey would rather cut straight to the real business of violently vetting disabled people for patriotism, out there furiously overturning wheelchairs like Indiana Jones weaving through the souk looking for Marion inside a laundry basket. Sometimes, you just get the heroes you need. Here are two pretty sound ideas. First, if anyone ever asks you to take a flag seriously, they’re immediately to be distrusted. A flag is just some colours. A flag has no inherent fixed meaning. Flags are groupthink, a suspension of independent thought. The civil rights movement wasn’t defined by a flag. The fall of the Berlin Wall didn’t have a flag. The peace movement didn’t have a flag, just flowers, hair and chauvinistic sex. And second, there are few things more un-English than brandishing the flag like a weapon. For this reason alone I am proud of Gary Neville for  , for trying to make the point that it is un-patriotically un-English to go around insisting on English patriotism. Neville is of course an easy target for accusations of luxury hypocrisy. He can be a doofus and a chop, the   who will also work for the state broadcaster at Qatar’s propaganda World Cup, a Lineker-level degree of cognitive dissonance. And yes, in his speech Neville rambled widely, exposing the contradictions of pretty much every fixed position you may choose to take right now. He should also have condemned acts of Islamic terrorism, something people on the left often seem unable to do. He shouldn’t have focused solely on “angry white middle-aged men” in the wake of a double murder at a synagogue. It is also a ducking of what he seemed to want to say. Which was to talk specifically about  , who does need to be challenged openly, who is a deeply cynical threat to the public discourse, a campy and theatrical nihilist posing as a Real Person, who uses fear and division to manipulate people into voting for him. But I am still proud of Neville for speaking up. It is good that a sportsperson is addressing this, an actual issue in his hometown, and doing so with genuine feeling, unafraid of the violent reaction that will follow. This is his parish. He is an angry middle-aged white man, and has spent a lot of time around flags. For all his easily gotcha-contradictions Neville feels it, is well-intentioned and is worth a million Farages. And while it is easy to say Stick To Sport VAR-boy, the reality is this has everything to do with sport, a place that has been aggressively flag-draped and militarised, where even a radio interview in midweek with the deeply mild Chris Woakes ended with the phrase “Thank you for your service” as though Woakes has been out there killing the Taliban for the last 10 years. Above all the reaction to Neville’s video message proved he was on to something. Before long a Traitor Scum banner had appeared outside Old Trafford. On the internet Neville was pilloried over old video clips of him not singing God Save the Queen, a genuine moment of salt and pepper flag-pledge madness. The Daily Telegraph has had a permanent hate-erection for the last four days, and can only be a small step away from giving away Gary Neville wicker dolls for your children to burn with its weekend editions. Rumour has it four leader writers have already been hospitalised by rage. Most tellingly the same paper published a response from Farage that suggested Neville should be fired by his private sector employer for not wanting to fly a flag, an idea so absurd, so unpatriotic, so wilfully ignorant, it seems impossible nobody inside this mighty engine of English free speech didn’t feel uneasy about projecting it as a serious political message. Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion It is worth looking at what Neville actually said. He said the messaging is getting dangerous. He said Brexit has had a terrible effect (see: the steel industry). He said we shouldn’t be pulled right and left. He said we must stop promoting abusive hate speech. He said he had ordered one of his building sites to take down a union flag because they had never previously flown one, and, like, it’s also just a building site. The best thing he said was that “the union flag being used in a negative fashion is not right”, something that is, intentionally or not, very George Orwell in its understanding of patriotism. Orwell gets marched around the place in a headlock all the time these days, dragged randomly into every debate. But he knew about symbols and flags and about Englishness and its values. In The Lion and the Unicorn, a love letter in support of the war against German fascism, he writes that a lack of reflexive flag-wagging is a key ingredient of English resilience and character. He speaks with pride and affection of the fact “the working man’s heart does not leap when he sees a union jack”, that “the patriotism of the common people is not vocal or even conscious”, and that   is above all a compromise, “a strange mixture of reality and illusion, democracy and privilege, humbug and decency”. Neville is groping for something similar, the fact the best kind of freedom is the freedom not to give two hoots about a square of fabric, or browbeating notions of patriotism. Pointedly, Orwell also preaches vigilance, the need to let your heritage grow and change, that England “has to be true to herself”, and that “she is not being true to herself while the refugees who have come to our shores are penned up in concentration camps”. Famously Orwell also hated sport because of its weaponising of nationalism, its glorification of physical victory, and has been proved right in this now more than ever before. England football didn’t traditionally have flags in it right through to the 1980s, when they would occasionally appear daubed with National Front slogans. Right now the last two hosts of the men’s World Cup, and also the next one, are involved in a bloody conflict of some kind. Orwell was half right. Sport is now war plus the shooting. There are two last things worth saying. Neville may be correct in his sense of a more nuanced idea of traditional English patriotism. But he is also out of time. The hive mind, shout-politics, algorithm life have trampled over lots of things. The idea that the best kind of Englishness can stay separate from this seems out of date. Britain itself is more than ever like a strange, small, damp archipelago marooned at the jumping-off point between the continents. On the other hand, it doesn’t mean this is fixed either. In Catch-22, The Great Loyalty Oath Crusade comes to an end when the largely silent Major de Coverley walks into the mess hall, scowls at the absurdity of flag-hugging and anthem-singing, and says three words: “Give Everybody Eat.” At which point the whole thing evaporates in its own absurdity. Someone has to say something, and keep saying it, however garbled or easily shot down. Neville may not be our George Orwell. But he is, for all his contradictions, a very English type of patriot.", "tags": ["gary", "neville", "england", "joey", "barton", "nigel", "farage", "comment"]},

Intensity? Tracking back? Not for us, thanks. Too many wanted to do their own thing and it  . The German is a coach who wants structure, identity, sacrifice and energy. At PSG, though, he saw how individualism can bring a dressing room down. How could Tuchel make his mark when he had players who would moan if a teammate looked at them the wrong way? And so to the question of England, celebrity and the power of the collective. It was with a good sense of timing that Steven Gerrard analysed the failures of the   this week. Club rivalries were a problem and the English obsession with star names was a hindrance. It is not a surprise that Tuchel, unafraid to risk bruising the odd ego or two, wants to create something different as he plots how to end England men’s long wait for a trophy at next summer’s World Cup. “We are building the best team” has been a regular refrain from Tuchel over the past week. There has been no backtracking  , Jack Grealish and Phil Foden. “The radical statement is that we don’t collect the most talented players,” Tuchel said before   on Thursday. “We collect the guys who have the glue and cohesion to be the best team.” Tuchel’s career offers pointers about his apparent power play with Bellingham. Having Neymar, Kylian Mbappé and Edinson Cavani at his disposal did not make PSG stronger in the crunch Champions League games, and there were problems at Bayern Munich with certain key players. At Chelsea, though, Tuchel’s greatest triumph –   – came with a counterattacking and defensively brilliant team. The key player during that run was N’Golo Kanté. Thiago Silva, a model professional, and the selfless, counterpressing Mason Mount were also vital. Chelsea were defiant, unflinching. With  , Tuchel’s mission is to forge a brotherhood. He shrugged off questions about whether leaving out his best creative players before the Wales game was a gamble too far. He backed his calls and was rewarded when England destroyed Craig Bellamy’s side with goals from Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins and Bukayo Saka during a brutal first half. We are starting to see Tuchel’s England take shape. Dynamic full-backs overlap, there is pace on the flanks (a crucial element if Harry Kane is to thrive at the World Cup) and balance is provided by Elliot Anderson’s emerging midfield partnership with Declan Rice. “We are getting there,” Tuchel said after the 3-0 win. “In Serbia it looked like club football and today it looked like club football.” Leaving aside whether England will be able to replicate the physicality of a Premier League style in the heat expected at many of the venues in the US, Mexico and Canada, it is worth considering the role of Rogers in the position usually occupied by Bellingham. “A humble player, a physical player … a very talented player,” was Tuchel’s verdict on the 23-year-old. More talented than Bellingham, though? Obviously not. Nobody doubts Bellingham’s ability. The 22-year-old is one of the best in the world. How do you leave out a player who, with disaster fast approaching, can keep his team in a tournament with a  ? The answer lies in looking at the wider picture; in remembering that Bellingham was often playing his own game at Euro 2024. Tuchel calls him a special talent. But while he has  , he has not taken back what he said about Bellingham needing to channel his edge towards his opponents and not to intimidating teammates or referees. None of this feels accidental. Pointing to Bellingham only just returning from shoulder surgery is convenient. Tuchel has talked about players needing to accept “the hierarchy within the team”. After the Wales game he said the door is open for “top quality, top characters” to return. Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Any return will be on his terms. Bellingham can come back but if he does there will be no special treatment. It is a fascinating situation. The smart money remains on Bellingham going to the World Cup but Tuchel has created a world in which he stays at home. The challenge is balancing the pros and cons. Bellingham would undoubtedly be an asset if he accepts Tuchel’s tactical demands and does not try to win the tournament on his own. But this is not going to be the Bellingham team. If anything this is still the Kane team. The captain reports for duty every time, fulfils his media duties without complaint and leads by example. Vincent Kompany, Kane’s manager at Bayern, talks about the forward’s work ethic off the ball. The goals are inevitable; the effort out of possession sets the standard for others to follow. This is what Tuchel craves. He would not be drawn into imagining whether he could possibly leave Bellingham, Foden and Cole Palmer on the bench in a World Cup game. He threw the focus on to the players who are performing for him now. England have played well without Bellingham in successive fixtures. Tuchel is fashioning a team, with Rogers as an updated version of Mount.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/11/clive-tyldesley-reader-interview-commentary-tv-media", "content": "I was never good enough at any sport to kid myself that I had a career at elite level. My parents would have told you that from an early age any sporting ambitions I entertained were in the area I ended up in; describing and commentating on top-level sport. I always resist any grading of goals or players or matches because I have a belief that sport belongs in its moment. Sport creates memories – we can recall vividly where we were, who we were with, what we were thinking, when our team won a trophy or an athlete won an Olympic gold medal … or  . Those moments are very personal, and the job of the commentator is to try to add something to the memory of those moments. And those moments are unique and should remain separate from one another. Preparation for a commentary is partly about researching information; in the modern era that includes statistics and data. But more importantly, preparation is a journalistic process, asking yourself: “What’s the story here?” “What does it mean for Blackburn Rovers to win this match or for Leicester City to win this match?” In cup finals the commentator gets extra air time after the final whistle – during the celebrations, during the presentation of the trophy – to reflect on what they have seen, and in preparation for that I often draw up a sheet which will have, in this case, Blackburn down one side and Leicester down the other … you can’t script lines because you don’t know what the story of the game is going to be, but you can write bullet points which highlight the significance of victory or the repercussions of defeat for the two teams involved. That’s a useful reference point in those very emotional moments after a game such a playoff final. It’s then a case of finding the right words to fit the moment, and that can really only be done in the moment. That’s a very good question, actually, because in saying what I said I broke the cardinal rule of commentary, the Devon Loch rule: never wave the winner across the winning line until they’re there. And if Bayern [Munich]  gone down the other end and equalised and the game went to penalties, they would have definitely won the shootout, and then there probably would have been an effigy of me hanging on a lamp-post at the Arndale Centre by midnight. I would have been blamed for Manchester United not winning the final. When I recall that game there was a definite change in momentum when the equaliser went in; it was as if the Bayern players and fans had witnessed some sort of awful human tragedy. There was a disbelief that it was difficult for them to recover from. And therefore, when Ole [Gunnar Solskjær] reached out and diverted the ball into the roof of the net, the heart overruled the head and  : “That’s it, that’s the winning goal.” Sounds like you lost it yourself! I do have a box of memorabilia but I’m pretty sure a copy of that cassette is not in it. Apologies Stephen, can’t help with that one, sadly. There are certain stadiums that create an atmosphere of their own; you wouldn’t be surprised to hear me say Anfield or Celtic Park on a Champions League night. But for the commentator that’s no good if you can’t see the pitch properly. And so in terms of favourite places to broadcast from I tend to make my selection based on the height and access of the commentary position. Some of them are a long way away from the pitch, some of them are too close to the pitch … some of them are too low, some of them are too high. For many years the commentary position at Goodison Park involved walking past the roof of the Bullens Road Stand and then shinnying down a vertical ladder, none of which is preferable in preparation for a football match! At modern stadiums, like the Emirates and the Etihad, you are provided with a commentary position that is at a perfect height. Also, I was fortunate enough to commentate on a couple of Cup finals in the Cardiff era, when Wembley was being renovated, and I always felt the commentary position there [the Millennium Stadium] was what I would call a “no-excuses commentary position”. I always struggle with this question because in my job I’m always trying very hard   to be speechless. I’ve got professional standards and hate it if I make an error, and getting lost for words would very much be an error. My great mentor   used to say: “Silent moments are not lesser moments; instead they are times during a television commentary when you don’t need to add anything and instead ask yourself what  you add next.” So silences are part of good commentary. The trend in contemporary sports media is towards conversation. We’ve seen the rise of the podcast and before that the rise of the phone-in. Even the main rights holders for live sport embroider their coverage with long discussions and debates. It’s the way we’ve consumed sport in classroom and barroom arguments and in recent times those arguments have become content and created stars, people who are genuine influencers and influence the way people consume sport. So there was an inevitability of that trend spilling into commentary; it’s become more conversational, which has been reflected in recent years with the rise of more than two people commentating on live football and other sporting events. The first priority of a commentator is to consider your audience and who your audience are. The audience for, say, a World Cup semi-final on terrestrial television is different to that for a Conference League game on TNT Sport. You need to commentate to your audience, and the danger when you have more than two people working on a live commentary is that they start talking to each other rather than to the audience. And, as the audience, you feel as if you’re eavesdropping into a conversation. That doesn’t serve an audience because it doesn’t engage and include them. A lot! It’s a phrase Andy Townsend first used regularly and [Ally] McCoist has taken to a different level! In all seriousness … the relationship between a commentator and a co-commentator is traditionally, and essentially, a trained broadcaster who can recognise the players and the drama and someone who has gone across the white line and can provide an informed, professional opinion on what we’ve just seen. I always bow to the experience of a co-commentator, and so if I said something and Andy looked at me and said “Not for me, Clive”, I fully took it on board. And ultimately it was a really good friend in a really gentle and sympathetic way saying: “Shut up! What do you know?!” If I was having one of those dream supper parties that people are often asked to put together, Andy and Ally would definitely be there. Both are great pals and wonderful co-commentators to work with, on and off the mic. As a kid I was fond of Manchester United; I’m from Bury, my dad took me to Old Trafford when I was five and throughout my youth there was only one team in the world for me. But when I started to work that feeling became diluted by the fact I was commentating on my mates; my friends were out there, people I had met through football. It’s a different feeling when you’re commentating on people who you know. In regards to that period, from basically 1999 through the noughties, Premier League clubs were among the regular contenders to win the Champions League and I guess it would have been nice to see Arsenal get over the line. I had no affinity with the club but I always had a huge amount of respect for Arsène Wenger; he was never dismissive of any inquiries, he always tried to be helpful, and that team during that era, with the likes of [Thierry] Henry, [Robert] Pires, [Dennis] Bergkamp, were certainly good enough to win a Champions League final, and in Paris [in 2006] they  . As previously touched on, I entertained ambitions of being a commentator from an early age; I wasn’t the only kid who chased a football around the park and commentated to himself, but I meant it. I wanted to do that. It was my one and only ambition. English was my favourite school subject; I was that kid who loved to write essays and poetry, and wrote the match reports for the school magazine. So English teachers were a big part of my school life and I can remember two or three who had a big influence on me. Mick Clarkson was certainly one of those. He died this year and I was fortunate to have some contact with him, after years and years and years with no contact, before he passed away. That was lovely. I’ve only been truly drunk twice in my adult life and once was with the England women’s football team in Sweden in 1995. It was after they lost [to Germany] in the quarter-finals, I was staying in the same hotel as the team and thought I could drink the likes of Clare Taylor and Kaz [Karen] Walker under the table; I was wrong! Nobody who follows women’s football needs telling the game had a very different profile in 1995 than it does in 2025 and some of the pioneers of the success England have enjoyed in recent years were in that team. So I look back fondly at being there, especially as it’s the only women’s football I have ever covered.   ­I’ve got pretty eclectic musical tastes; I like a bit of everything and make a point of listening to contemporary music, and more than anything I’m in awe of anybody who can write words that take my breath away. Make me think. Make me cry. Joni Mitchell certainly had that ability, she was one of the truly great songwriters of my youth. More than anything I admired how she could – can – take men apart in two lines. She knows us much better than we know ourselves.", "tags": ["football", "sport", "reader", "interview", "interviews"]},

Bleak, you might say. That is why their current new-manager bounce and burst of positivity is such a breath of fresh air, not only for the club but for the WSL as a whole. Under Martin Ho, Spurs have won four of their opening five WSL matches of this campaign, putting them third in the table, four points better off than neighbours Arsenal, and they could even go top on Sunday if they were to pull of a shock win at leaders and champions, Chelsea. A team that conceded the joint-second highest number of goals last season has kept three clean sheets out of a possible five in the league, and that has come in tandem with much-improved performances from the Australia defender Clare Hunt, who has barely put a foot wrong alongside an early contender for the division’s young signing of the summer, the 19-year-old Japan centre-back Toko Koga. Tottenham fought off Champions League clubs’ interest to sign Koga from Feyenoord and, with her maturity awareness and maturity of defensive positioning, you could be forgiven for mistakenly thinking she is, at the very, least, in her late twenties. At the other end of the pitch, Spurs’s other summer signing – yes, they only made two signings this summer – Cathinka Tandberg, has scored three times and could become only the third Tottenham player to score in three or more consecutive WSL games. There is   about Ho, the former Manchester United assistant manager who has handled his media duties with conviction alongside a relaxed tone that seems to be rubbing off on his team. He is also refusing to get carried away with his side’s early form. “There is still a lot of work to do; we’re only five games in,” he insisted in the buildup to the Chelsea game. “The players’ feet are very well grounded. We always look for things we can do better and we have to keep improving.” It is understood Tottenham had a shortlist of about 30 candidates for the head coach post this summer before eventually interviewing seven, and it was Ho’s obsessive passion for the role, combined with what were seen as glowing references, that led to him being appointed after a two-year spell at Brann in Norway. So are Tottenham the real deal or is their early success under Ho a temporary hot streak? The watching world may well find out on Sunday as they take on the toughest assignment in the WSL: facing Chelsea away from home. Sonia Bompastor’s side have won all 11 of their previous WSL meetings with Tottenham and are unbeaten in 30 consecutive league fixtures. Sign up to  No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football after newsletter promotion There was a boost for Tottenham’s followers this week when the club’s owners injected £100m into the club. The Lewis family trust want the cash to “continue the focus on driving long-term sporting success”, and while no specific breakdown has been provided publicly regarding how much of the extra finance will go to men’s football, women’s football or the academy, Ho has spoken positively about the owners. “I’ve met them numerous times at the games. We are very well supported,” he insisted. “They are doing everything they can to make sure we evolve and we grow. I have no doubt they’ll continue to support us in the next window and beyond that; they have some really ambitious plans for this team.” This week the club also confirmed the appointment of Lawrence Shamieh, formerly Manchester United’s analyst, as first-team assistant coach. That followed September’s appointment of Adam Jeffrey as first-team coach, while Sara Cullis, who joined from Manchester City in June, is Spurs’s new head of analysis, leading on talent identification and recruitment. “You have to have people around you that you can trust and it enables the players to grow also, not just me,” Ho said. “I believe we can be pioneers in those departments which we have really strong colleagues in. It’s a really big step in the right direction.” Tottenham also won four of their first five WSL matches in 2021-22, a campaign when they went on to achieve their highest ever top-flight finish of fifth. They also started the 2023-24 campaign brightly under Ho’s predecessor, Robert Vilahamn, and the challenge now will be stretching the run. Opta predicts Spurs only maintain a 1.1% chance of finishing third but they are now deemed more likely to finish in the top half than any of the other sides outside of the WSL’s established ‘big four’.

It also found that rates of intimate partner violence were 2.5 times lower in countries that had introduced comprehensive measures on violence.

By 2050, under a worst-case climate scenario, up to 158.3 million more women and girls globally may live in extreme poverty (subsisting on less than $2.15 a day) as a result of climate change. Nearly half could be in sub-Saharan Africa. “When systems are in place that really put women and girls at their heart, we see very concrete progress,” said Sarah Hendriks, director of UN Women’s policy division. “But what the gender snapshot shows is that progress hasn’t been fast enough – there is both stagnation [and] regression,” she added. The proportion of women and girls living in extreme poverty has hovered at 10% since 2020, the report found, and on current trends more than 351 million will remain in that status by 2030.

Those in the most important positions are five times as likely to have attended private school than the general population, showing it is still possible to “buy advantage”,  . Since 2019, the number of privately educated elites has barely changed and in some fields is growing, the report found. The social mobility charity said it was a “disgrace” that most of the country’s top jobs were still dominated by privileged people. Overall, senior armed forces personnel were the most likely to be privately educated, with 63% of officers of two-star rank (major generals and equivalents in other services) and above attending a fee-paying school, a rise of 14% compared with six years ago. This was true of a similar proportion of judges, at 62%, followed by male cricketers at 59%, despite independent school attendance being 7% across the population. In business, of the FTSE 100 chief executives who were educated in the UK, 37% attended private school, while this was true of 68% of their chairs after those who were educated abroad were stripped out, making it the most privately educated profession in the report. This represented a 15% rise in six years. Nearly a quarter of MPs and half of the House of Lords were privately educated, and that was also true of half of newspaper columnists – up 7 percentage points since 2019 – 47% of political commentators and 45% of podcasters. Only three categories were below the national average – male professional footballers at 5%, female professional footballers at 4% and the Northern Ireland assembly, where nobody attended a fee-paying school. The report also revealed stark figures on the proportion of the elite who attended Oxbridge, with three-quarters of senior judges attending either Oxford or Cambridge, compared with only 1% of the population. Those institutions were also dominant among senior civil servants, with 66% of permanent secretaries being Oxbridge graduates. About a third of charity chief executives were privately educated and a fifth attended Oxbridge, showing that even the third sector is not immune to elitism. Nick Harrison, the chief executive of the Sutton Trust, said: “It’s a disgrace that most of the top jobs in Britain are still dominated by those from privileged education backgrounds, representing a small fraction of the wider population. “Little progress has been made in opening up positions of power, with those from private schools maintaining a vice-like grip on the most important roles. “In 2025 you can still buy advantage, massively increasing your chance of getting into the most powerful roles in the country. This is grossly unfair, and a waste of talent on a huge scale. If we want a fairer country and a stronger economy, employers and policymakers must take responsibility for levelling the playing field, where privilege is no longer a passport to power.” The charity is calling on the government to make it compulsory for organisations with more than 250 employees to report their class pay gaps to tackle access and progression problems. The Sutton Trust said in order to find talented individuals and “build a better pipeline of leaders”, employers should also look at education achievements in the context of disadvantage, including attending underperforming schools and less advantaged neighbourhoods, as well as looking beyond a narrow range of universities. Carl Cullinane, the director of research and policy at the Sutton Trust, said “too often, social class is not included” in the diversity conversation. He added: “Making the most of talent, wherever it comes from, means employers can move beyond a narrow cohort of candidates from the most advantaged backgrounds.

It seems clear that the British media has a social mobility problem. And despite some recent efforts, it’s not a problem that is going away anytime soon. A high proportion of leading figures in the British media are from private school backgrounds. While only 7% of people attend private school nationwide, our report found half of newspaper columnists are privately educated, along with 47% of political commentators, 45% of leading podcasters and 38% of   executives. What’s more, the proportion of privately educated newspaper columnists has actually increased since  . In the case of BBC executives, it has jumped by 10 percentage points. It’s striking and somewhat depressing that so many of those providing commentary on the issues affecting British people’s lives – columnists, talking heads and podcasters – are from a private school background, much more so than those whose role is to report news. Furthermore, more than 40% of columnists and political commentators attended Oxbridge, a significantly higher proportion than the rest of the media. Even amid a rapidly changing media environment, these roles have great influence over the perspectives that are shared daily and help to shape the national conversation. They also play a crucial role in holding the government and others to account. But they continue to come from a very narrow segment of society. Even the emergence of podcasting as a new medium does not appear to be translating to an increased diversity of voices. Many of the most popular podcasts are owned by the big media players and populated with familiar voices from the existing media and political firmament. This report should also raise serious questions for the BBC, at a time when it is under frequent political attack and trying to justify its licence fee. To see those at the highest levels becoming less representative of ordinary Britons is of significant concern. To its credit, the corporation is recognising the issue and has in the past  .

Of course, editors in all media will be acutely aware of the need to reflect the audiences they serve. Encouragingly, many media organisations – the Guardian included – are now trying to address these structural inequalities and to introduce schemes  , including class diversity. However, there are serious headwinds against wider change. The industry is rapidly changing, and as   and specialist titles have dwindled, so have many of the entry-level positions that traditionally served as a springboard. It is harder than ever to break into media for those without connections, for example, or opportunities to complete unpaid work experience. Even once in the door, it is a precarious industry, which may put off many of those without a financial safety net. Long-term contracts are becoming rarer, and it is increasingly difficult to make freelancing pay. Addressing these issues will be extremely challenging, but crucial if the industry is to develop a more representative pipeline of talent for the future.

The findings from the EU’s Agency for Fundamental Rights,   were based on responses from 1,920 people in 30 countries across Europe. All of them identified as intersex, an umbrella term referring to those with innate variations of sex characteristics and which can also include people who identify as trans, non-binary and gender diverse. It found that since 2019, the rates of violence and harassment against intersex people have sharply increased – particularly among those who identify as trans, non-binary and gender diverse – far outpacing   by others in the LGBTQ+ community. One in three surveyed, 34%, said they had been physically or sexually assaulted in the five years prior to the survey, up from 22% in 2019. Between 2019 and 2023, the rate of reported hate-motivated harassment had almost doubled, from 42% to 74%. The survey also found that more than half, 57%, of respondents said they had been subjected “without their informed consent” to surgery or other medical treatment to modify their sex characteristics, while 39% said they were put through so-called conversion practices aimed at changing their sexual orientation or gender, compared with a rate of 25% among all LGBTQ+ groups. The Vienna-based agency linked the rise to a wider climate of “increasing or persisting intolerance and bigotry, as well as intense online hatred campaigns” that had “instrumentalised” the LGBT+ community. “Disinformation campaigns fomenting intolerance and prejudice are often waged by foreign and domestic actors acting to undermine European and western democracies and core values, such as dignity, equality and diversity,” the agency noted. The result was a “weaponising” of the fact that many people know little about those who identify as intersex, trans, non-binary and gender diverse, allowing these campaigns to spread disinformation and “fuel hatred and violence against them”, it said.

The figure was notably higher than the overall rate of 37% reported across all LGBTIQ groups.

The reality is, when we talk about representing working-class women in Britain, we’re usually only talking about a narrow few.

These are real-life women and girls from working-class communities, whose sexual abuse has been cruelly packaged into the most convenient of political footballs, now kicked daily to justify racist abuse. These calls have prompted violent disorder in Rotherham, Epping and now the streets of central London. Those who sanction or ignore this encourage cruel racial scapegoating of ethnic communities. It is women with nothing, seeking asylum in the UK, who are placed at the greatest risk. Those who claim to march in the interests of materially disadvantaged young women fail to mention that they are only interested in protecting white women.

We must broaden our understanding of what it means to be a working-class woman, beyond the white, conventionally socially mobile faces that dominate and artificially define. Politicians are not the only ones with a role to play. White women from working-class communities must not let their identities be weaponised. We must push back and stress solidarity born of material struggle. The phrase “working-class woman” refers to all kinds of people, united by inherited, systemic economic disadvantage.

Forty-eight per cent growth in its business compared with the same quarter last year, including 93% growth in its US commercial business. These elephantine numbers are maddening – and, in large part, a result of the company fully embracing artificial intelligence (AI). The AI revolution is here and as its proponents   us daily, it will remake our world, making every company and government agency more efficient and less error-prone while helping us unlock hitherto unheard of advances in science and technology. Not only this, but if we play our cards right, big tech’s latest explosion could yield unprecedented economic growth. Though, we might ask, growth for whom? Consider  , the technology giant behind ChatGPT. In a promo video announcing the latest upgrade for their flagship software, its CEO, Sam Altman,  : “It can write an entire computer program from scratch.” Three days later, the New York Times   that computer science grads “are facing some of the highest unemployment rates” among their peers. And it’s not just coders and engineers. AI-powered automation promises to swallow up jobs at the low end of the labor market too, with McDonald’s, Walmart and Amazon all clamoring to integrate AI tools to automate everything from service interactions to warehouse picking and sorting. As ex-ante reward for all these cost-cutting layoffs, the fortunes of AI entrepreneurs have ballooned beyond all comprehension. So far, if the AI revolution has succeeded in anything, it is in making very rich people even more rich. Rallies on Wall Street have seen AI stocks surge at a record pace for hundreds of so-called “unicorns” – the nearly   AI startups that are valued at more than $1bn each. According to  , 29 founders of AI companies are now newly minted billionaires. And remember, nearly all of these firms were founded in the last five years. Why are investors so bullish on the AI boom? Partly because this technology promises to lay off more workers, more rapidly, than any innovation in recent memory. The ludicrous valuations of AI startups are predicated on the idea that this technology has the power to eliminate the very need for human labor. And the business of layoffs is very  . In that sense, the AI boom could represent the most efficient upward redistribution of wealth in modern history. To be sure, some AI wizards insist the fallout from all of this won’t be so bad for the little guy. Microsoft even   that blue-collar workers might have an edge in the AI economy of the future. But none of this is very convincing. Some workers with durable skills will be able to hold on to good wages and stable work for a time. But with breakthroughs in self-driving cars, increasingly roboticized warehouses, lights-out factories and   restaurants, non-college-educated workers are going to feel the AI impact much sooner than rosy predictions suggest. All of this raises a question about the current direction of our economy and whether a strategy that prioritizes hi-tech development over all else makes any sense any more – or if it ever did. In the late 1990s, the dawning of the knowledge economy was heralded as the solution to many economic woes. As the economy of brains replaced the economy of brawn, Americans were promised new heights of greatness. Sure, factories would close and with them millions of high-wage, union jobs would disappear, but the new jobs at Google would be so much better. As a generation of workers was laid off, their children were encouraged to “upskill”, go to college, and   for the jobs of the future. How ironic, then, that AI, the zenith of knowledge work, is resulting in the   of knowledge jobs. Karl Marx once wrote that the bourgeoisie created its own gravedigger in the immiserated proletariat. Today’s tech elite seems intent on realizing that prophecy. It’s not only that the information age supercharged a new class of oligarchs, from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos to Elon Musk, who now command unfathomable sums of wealth. It’s also that further down the income ladder, wide   have opened up along educational lines. As computer-based work became prized, wage inequality between college-educated and non-college-educated workers created a widening social gulf. Today, one’s position on a variety of cultural divisions – from gender ideology to immigration – can be dependably   by one’s position in the labor market. Those who still make their money by some combination of craft and muscle are increasingly estranged from those who make theirs through the manipulation and administration of “data”. In urban knowledge hubs, an almost medieval class system prevails, with an untouchable clique of bankers and big tech clerics at the top. A large, relatively well-off layer of lawyers, medical professionals and white-collar knowledge workers are beneath them, followed by a proud, but squeezed group of blue-collar and service workers, and finally, a crisis-ridden group made up of the semi- and permanently unemployed. Not surprisingly, this inequality has resulted in political dysfunction. Enmity, suspicion, resentment and extreme polarization characterize our civic scene, ultimately making for a   with no winners except the financial and technological elite, who have effectively monopolized their influence on government. Under Joe Biden, they were showered with incentives and subsidies in the form of the Chips and Science Act. Under  , they win tax cuts and  . No matter who is in power, they always seem to get richer. Socially, the great gains of the knowledge economy have also failed to live up to their promises. With instantaneous global connectivity, we were promised cultural excellence and social effervescence. Instead, we’ve been delivered an endless scroll of  . Smartphone addictions have made us more vicious, bitter and boring. Social media has made us narcissistic. Our attention spans have been zapped by the constant, pathological need to check our notifications. In the built environment, the omnipresence of touchscreen kiosks has removed even the slightest possibility of social interaction. Instead of having conversations with strangers, we now only interact with screens. All of this has made us more lonely and less happy. As a cure, we’re now offered AI companions, which have the unfortunate side effect of occasionally inducing   breaks. Do we really need any more of this? ost of what we actually need to achieve some measure of the common good requires common labor. To rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and even to upgrade our electrical grid, we need electricians, steelworkers and bricklayers – not gargantuan data centers. To clean city streets, we need more, and better-paid, sanitation workers – not “smart” trash  . To handle problems of crime and social order we need more police officers on patrol – not a fleet of robot crime  . To improve transportation, we don’t need self-driving cars, we need buses and trains with people who drive them. In other words, there is plenty of meaningful work to be done, if only we, as a society, invested in the low-tech economy. Not to mention that all the essential stuff of life – love, family, friendship, community – are still best left in analog. Beyond desirability, investing in a low-tech future might become a necessity. Despite all the hype about the potential for AI, the whole thing could be a  . The sheer scale of investor money pouring into the AI craze has all the signs of a speculative  . If it bursts, it could sink the already fragile Trumpified economy. To be sure, this is not a Luddite appeal. Advances in technology should continue apace. But should tech development be the main, and overwhelming,   of the  ? In 2022 Congress approved some $280bn in hi-tech investments. In 2024 private investment in AI alone reached $230bn. This year, buoyed by Trump’s deregulation and Wall Street overconfidence, tech’s biggest companies are   to invest another $320bn in AI and data centers. By comparison, the price tag for Biden’s supposedly mammoth investments in roads and bridges totaled a paltry $110bn. It’s not that we need to throttle technology, but the   is out of whack. Marx – who was as great a promethean progressive as one could find – thought technology ought to serve social and human needs. Today, we have the formula exactly backwards – society serves tech. Of course, Silicon Valley leaders like to tell us that the increasingly complex challenges of the future will only be solved by yet more investments in R&D, yet more deregulation and clearance for ever-larger voltage-greedy data centers. But it’s not the complex problems of the future that are the most intractable. It’s the age-old conundrums of money, class and power.

They deliver everything here, he said. We’ll call the store downstairs. And so it was with a kind of slack-jawed astonishment I answered the doorbell nine minutes later to a man in a motorcycle helmet, proffering a single blue carrier bag containing a single tube of Colgate, taking the money and receding wordlessly back into the night. This, a decade ago, was my first contact with  . And though of course you can get gig-economy groceries in most major cities these days, Dubai still stands out as a world of shortcuts and simple conveniences, a world of abundance and plenty, a world where everyone and everything has its price. If you fancy a quadruple-decker club sandwich at 3am, Dubai has you covered. Taxis are cheap and everywhere. At the famous Friday brunches hosted by most of the luxury hotels, afternoons dissolve in a bouquet of bottomless fizz, the plates shovelled high with food that will never be eaten. For three weeks I drifted through its five-star establishments and pristine malls, pursued by aggressive blasts of air conditioning, trying not to look into the shadows. This is the Dubai that gets served up by the countless athletes and celebrities and entrepreneurs and lifestyle influencers and friends on your Instagram feed: a temple of rooftop bars and postcard sunsets, gratification and guilt-free consumption. In a way, this is a place whose unabashed ostentation could scarcely have been better suited around the age of shareable content: a city constructed entirely of snapshots, a secret that dares you to keep it to yourself, an escape from your dreary, high-tax, pigeon-plagued existence. Recently, however, a certain vibe shift has taken place. A harder and more cogent vision of Dubai seems to have emerged in our political discourse, one in which the emirate is depicted not simply as an escapist lifestyle or luxury holiday destination, but a model society that we should be trying to emulate ourselves. Glossy travel features have evolved into full-blown paeans to Emirati society and culture. And if you peer between the lines, you get perhaps the clearest glimpse yet of exactly how the populist right wants to remake the UK. “That’s the level of ambition the rest of the world needs,”   on a trip to the city earlier this year. And it was interesting to see Reform UK announcing its latest immigration plans on Monday with   to the United Arab Emirates system, in which migrants are issued periodic work visas that continually need to be renewed. “As a political class, we’re not prepared to learn enough from other nations that are getting it right,” said the party’s deputy leader, Richard Tice,   earlier this year. So what does Reform reckon Dubai is getting right? Tice spoke approvingly of the state’s low rate of crime, its sense of national pride, the way schoolchildren are made to stand in class every morning for the national anthem. Tice, in turn, was endorsing   written by his partner, Isabel Oakeshott, who relocated to Dubai last year to escape Labour’s tax on private schools. In it, she enthused over her new home: “a place without striking train drivers, aggressive pro-Hamas marches and endless rain … no toxic gender ideology claptrap or critical race theory … no Just Stop Oil protesters … Those who break the law or can’t look after themselves are simply imprisoned or deported … With no safety net … everyone is hustling.” Here, then, is the quiet part being said out loud. Dubai presents the hard-right vision of utopia: a place stripped of workers’ protections or the right to protest, a place of pure environmental dereliction, a place where everyone drives everywhere, a place where the queer and the gender-fluid are told from birth that they simply do not exist, a place where citizenship is defined along narrow ethnic lines and everyone else is there on sufferance, where the super-rich and well-connected can simply do and consume as they please. A place where the poor are simply cleared out of sight. But of course, the poor do exist in Dubai. They live in often squalid camps on the baking peripheries of the city, working long hours for low wages with no protections, indentured if not always by law then by circumstance. Migrant workers  , most from south Asia or the Philippines. And unlike the small and gilded class of native Emiratis who enjoy free healthcare and a generous welfare state, they must toil unquestioningly in a system engineered to embed their subservience. This is the golden archetype of which the influencer Andrew Tate speaks when he calls for “white Dubai”, a country explicitly modelled on racial hierarchy, where the existence of a permanent underclass is not a design flaw but the very point of the exercise. “ ,” he urges to his millions of followers. “Everyone else is a visitor on a visa with a two-tier legal system, impenetrable borders and instant deportations.” Sign up to  Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more after newsletter promotion It is likely that such a society would by default be non-democratic, run on state violence and a ruthless suppression of dissent, where morality is enforced by oligarchic decree, right down to laws on adultery punishable by prison. It would have massive wealth inequalities baked in, perhaps even revered, an endless reservoir of black and brown men to serve your drinks and build your nine-lane highways. It would, in short, look a lot like Dubai. But there would be flags everywhere, and crime would be low, and the buildings would be tall and gleaming, and most importantly you could hire a migrant worker to bring a tube of toothpaste to your front door at any time of the day or night. Come for the beaches and the brunches; stay for the privatised healthcare and human rights restrictions.

While Reform UK and other populist movements use simple, more direct and emotionally charged messaging that thrives on social media, Labour continues to rely on complex, policy-driven narratives. The sense of hope or   that animated Labour’s general election campaign quickly evaporated in the face of cuts to the winter fuel allowance and disability benefits. Meanwhile, rising inequality, stagnant wages, job insecurity and the lasting effects of successive financial and public health crises have eroded trust in parties seen as failing to deliver economic stability, growth and meaningful job creation. The labour market is also shifting rapidly, leaving many workers without the upskilling needed to adapt. Reform UK has capitalised on this disillusionment by playing the underdog card, pushing a polarising “us versus them” narrative that resonates powerfully with those who feel left behind. Populists further amplify anxieties over migration, national identity and rapid social change – issues that Labour is clearly struggling to address with conviction. To win back trust,   must go beyond policy detail. People want purpose, dignity and hope. That means crafting a message that inspires while still being grounded in facts and critical thinking. Britain deserves better than the populist sensationalism that is currently dominating debate. What is needed is leadership that speaks to values, restores belief in politics and offers a genuine vision of a fairer future.  Kirsty Major is spot-on in her article on Knowsley. I live in the south Wales valleys and can easily see Reform UK taking valley seats should a parliamentary byelection occur. The seat neighbouring me, Caerphilly, is   for the Senedd in Cardiff in October, and the feeling is that Reform will take it. If it does, it could lead to Reform being the biggest party in the Senedd after the 2026 election. Major is right about the growth of Reform in poor areas, and unless Labour does something quickly, its death knell is sounding.  Surely the way to stop Labour’s existential decline is to offer what people voted for: a Labour government with a workable vision of what it can achieve. What Labour has is a sycophantic cabinet supporting a prime minister lacking political nous, a leader who curtailed job opportunities, withdrew benefits from a section of disabled claimants, allowed Reform UK’s clamour on immigrants to colour his response and has shown a more positive attitude to Israel than to Palestine. He seems complacent with his vision, despite his gloom and doom communications.

The letter, sent before her speech at the   party conference in Liverpool on Monday afternoon, was coordinated by Refugee Action and signed by 105 organisations from a wide range of sectors – including Save the Children, Mind, Oxfam, Shelter, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, as well as dozens of migrant and anti-racism charities. It has also been signed by the PCS union, which represents Border Force workers. The signatories have called on Mahmood to find solutions to problems with housing, the climate crisis and the  , and end the use of “performative policies” that cause harm. “The government wants to deliver growth and renew Britain. This requires tackling issues such as growing extreme inequality, underfunded councils, lack of investment in quality housing, a crumbling NHS, the climate emergency and polluted waters,” the letter says. “Targeting refugees will do nothing to tackle these structural issues or improve people’s lives. It only serves as a dangerous smokescreen to scapegoat the most vulnerable and distract from the very real dangers to our society.” It urges the home secretary to work with local authorities, charities and refugees, “who face the reality of the hostile policies and rhetoric”, to find solutions. This summer, sometimes violent demonstrations outside hotels have intimidated people seeking asylum – as well as a large far-right-organised rally in London earlier this month,  . “Anger and division will never satisfy voters in the long term. They cause tensions in our communities, dividing us and tearing the social fabric of our society,” the signatories warn. “As the new home secretary, you now have an opportunity to turn the tide, and to end the scapegoating of migrants and performative policies that only cause harm. “The government runs the risk of this country accelerating along a dangerous path, and now is the time to urgently correct this and change course.” Tim Naor Hilton, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “Austerity and growing wealth inequality are among the real devils forcing more families to use food banks and creating longer waits to see a doctor or find a secure home. “The breadth of support for this letter shows that blaming people seeking asylum for problems not created by them has huge consequences across all parts of society.” Areeba Hamid, the co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “A week after the new home secretary was appointed, more than 100,000 people joined a far-right rally in our capital, reprising scenes we thought were consigned to the dustbin of history. That should be a wake-up call. “Like the home secretary, I am an example of the benefits immigration brings to the United Kingdom. Our companies, communities and cherished institutions like the NHS are filled with similar examples. “If we are to stand for decency and inclusion, we need to start with changing the tone of our debate about immigration.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary has said that secure borders are an essential part of being a tolerant, open, generous country and she will explore all options to restore order to our immigration system.”", "tags": ["shabana", "mahmood", "inequality", "nhs", "labour", "climate", "crisis", "immigration", "and", "asylum", "news"]},

I fled the place after two years of a three-year contract because of the horrible way the emirate treats guest workers. I’ve returned three times on brief trips because of my work as a journalist or consultant (plus once because a storm cancelled my flight). On all those trips, the place appeared glitzy, but the nasty underbelly persisted. I’ve watched as bored local men bought heroin as the electric windows of their car slid open to permit an exchange on the roads. I’ve visited hospitals where the babies of maids raped by their employers waited for adoption. I’ve seen the stables where the locals house thoroughbreds in palatial conditions that the labourers who work on constructions in 45C heat would consider a paradise. I have watched rents skyrocket over the past two decades, in a city where vast numbers of apartments remain empty while owners wait for property prices to rise.

Its rise from fishing port to global hub was not an organic process but a highly planned strategy of accumulation by dispossession. Land reclamation, mega-projects and speculative real-estate ventures are not simply architectural spectacles, they are instruments for financialising space and transferring wealth upward. Marxism frames cities as sites where the contradictions of capitalism are intensified. Dubai illustrates this vividly. Its luxury malls, artificial islands and glittering towers represent use-values only for elites and global investors. Beneath them lies an underclass of migrant workers living in segregated, precarious conditions – an echo of Marx’s reserve army of labour. This bifurcation allows the city to appear as a post-national “world city” while relying on tightly policed hierarchies of race, citizenship and class. Harvey’s concept of the “right to the city” also highlights what is absent in Dubai: democratic urban governance and collective claims over space. Public life is subordinated to consumption and spectacle; dissent, unionising and grassroots urbanism are tightly restricted. Far from being a neutral platform for cosmopolitan exchange, Dubai’s urban fabric reflects a deliberate strategy to attract global capital and manage labour in ways that keep the contradictions of accumulation out of sight. In Marxist terms, Dubai is a paradigmatic case of urbanisation as a class project. It converts oil rents and speculative finance into monumental infrastructure to secure future accumulation, while externalising social and ecological costs on to invisible populations and distant environments. Its promise of limitless growth is thus both a mirage and a warning about the planetary limits of the capitalist city.", "tags": ["dubai", "inequality", "karl", "marx", "united", "arab", "emirates", "human", "rights", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "workers'", "rights", "letters"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/04/salzburg-mansion-tunnel-porsche-heir-jewish-writer-stefan-zweig", "content": "or three years the peace and quiet of Doris Rüggeberg’s cosy flat on the Kapuzinerberg, a picturesque wooded hill in Salzburg, has been interrupted by the noise from the nextdoor neighbour’s building site. Wolfgang  , a German-Austrian automotive magnate, bought the 17th-century villa at No 5 as a second home in 2019 for about €9m (£7.8m). Ever since, he has been busily renovating the property before he and his partner, Gabriele Prinzessin zu Leiningen, move in this winter. The eight-room house, referred to locally as the Paschinger Schlössl, was home from 1919 to 1934 to the writer  , who described it as “romantic and impractical”. Among its charms, he wrote, was that it was “inaccessible to cars” and could “only be reached by climbing more than a hundred steps”. Such an idyll has seemed remote in recent years. Rüggeberg, a counsellor, says the building work has been so loud that she has sometimes not been able to hear herself think. But trying as the past years have been, Rüggeberg fears it could be just the start. Porsche last month secured permission from Salzburg authorities for a plan to build an estimated €10m private access road from a municipal car park in the historic city centre through the rugged limestone hill. The 82-year-old’s vision is that the 500-metre road will lead to a subterranean garage next to the villa where he will be able to park eight cars. Porsche has spoken of how he likes to take his cars on early morning spins on the sharp bends up of the Großglockner, Austria’s highest mountain peak, about 120 miles (190km) to the south. His original idea had been for a personal lift to be built to take him up to his home. When that was rejected, he submitted plans for the road. Even in Salzburg, which is used to the foibles of the rich and famous who gather in the city every year for the renowned opera festival, and which appreciates the financial contribution these wealthy guests make, this is seen by some as a step too far. “Porsche has done a lot for the local economy,” Rüggeberg said. “But in this case, the city has failed to negotiate properly. All men are equal but some are more equal than others.” At the very least, she said, she would have liked the city to have insisted the road be accessible to emergency vehicles, rubbish collection and other residents. Porsche received initial permission in early 2024 from Salzburg’s former mayor, a member of the conservative Austrian People’s party, to dig out “the  ” (car cave). Soon after, the council was taken over by a leftwing contingent, a Social Democrat mayor and his deputy from the Communist party amid concerns the rich were pricing ordinary Salzburgers out of their own city. The new mayor, Bernhard Auinger, worked for Porsche for 27 years and used to sit on the board of its holding company as a former labour representative. He has admitted “the optics could be better”, but has said he has little influence over a project he “inherited”. “No one will have to see the tunnel or even be aware it’s there,” Auinger told Salzburg media. “Whether the tunnel is in keeping with the times and morally justifiable is for others to judge.” Ingeborg Haller, the head of the Greens on the city council, has led opposition to the project and kept the topic in the public domain. “What has appalled people is that a private person is being allowed to hollow out the mountain for his own gain,” she said. She has also been critical of the €48,000 fee Porsche paid the council for permission to cut through land that belongs to the city. An independent expert called in by Auinger after the fee was queried concluded Porsche had overpaid by several thousand euros. Salzburg’s city planning committee, which approved the road in early September,  said the project was in the public interest because as long as Porsche’s cars were in the tunnel they would not be emitting exhaust fumes, taking up room or causing accidents. This, say critics, is absurd. “These are wildly amusing arguments, on top of many others we’ve heard, like the fact the parking lots already at the house are apparently insufficient,” the communist deputy mayor, Kay-Michael Dankl, told the Guardian. Sign up to  The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Dankl suggested the affair had “undermined people’s trust in the rule of law”, and reinforced the perception there was “one rule for the rich, another for the poor”. The proposed road has also led to some creative protest. A group of environmentalists, calling itself the Porsche Tunnel festival, has hung banners from the Kapuzinerberg reading: “And Porsche said, let there be a hole.” Despite the anger, the project , having gained the approval of the planning committee, is almost certain to go ahead. A vote by the state of Salzburg is considered a formality and work is expected to begin soon. Apart from any environmental or ethical concerns raised by a billionaire’s plans to bore into a hill, there is an additional dimension that makes it particularly problematic for some. The villa was Zweig’s home for a quarter of his life, before the Jewish writer fled in 1934, fearing the impact the rise of fascism in Austria would have on his life after a politically motivated police raid on his home. It was here that Zweig, a humanist and pacifist whose memoirs inspired the 2014 Wes Anderson   The Grand Budapest Hotel, entertained literati such as Thomas Mann, James Joyce and the composer Richard Strauss. (Long before Zweig, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s sister, Nannerl, also gave piano lessons here.) It jars with some locally and beyond that the city did not buy the house from its previous owners and keep it as a memorial to Zweig. In front of the house, brass   – or stumbling stones – commemorate Zweig, his wife, Friderike Zweig-Winternitz, and her two daughters, all of whom lived there. Instead, the house was bought by Porsche, who, as the German magazine Stern noted, is “the son of an SS man … the grandson of Hitler’s best carmaker”. Ferdinand Porsche, who founded the business, designed the Volkswagen Beetle for the Nazi leader.

Goodness, Phillip, you really can’t let this obsession with boomers go, can you? Economic inequalities – and with them social and health inequalities – are getting worse, and while Inman tells us with monotonous regularity that “it’s the boomers wot dun it”, it is in fact a little more complicated.

Now that the summer silly season is over, please could we have some proper economic analysis from someone who takes inequalities seriously.  Phillip Inman’s article trades in ageist stereotyping rather than serious analysis. No evidence is offered to show that boomers as a group actually believe their wealth stems from uniquely “wise choices”. Attitudes to prosperity and inequality vary far more by politics and education than by year of birth, yet the article paints an entire generation with a single brush. It is true that many in the postwar cohort benefited from advantages unavailable today: affordable housing, secure pensions and generous tax reliefs. But if intergenerational fairness is to be addressed seriously, it should be debated in terms of policy, not reduced to caricatures of older people as smug and self-deluded.

The situation is so dire that nearly 100 heads of radiotherapy and oncology – three-quarters of England’s radiotherapy leaders – have warned in an open letter that the government is failing patients. International experts agree that   (53%) of all cancer patients will typically need radiotherapy, but exclusive analysis of the latest NHS data in England shows only 35% actually receive it. The study by the charity Radiotherapy UK found 181,023 cancer patients should have received radiotherapy but only 120,569 did, leaving 60,455 patients a year without any radiotherapy at all. Regional inequalities are rife. In south-west England, 36% of patients receive radiotherapy, meaning around 7,200 patients miss out, while in the south-east, 33.7% receive treatment, with more than 10,100 missing out. The leading oncologist and chair of Radiotherapy UK, Prof Pat Price, said: “Thousands of cancer patients risk dying prematurely either because they are not getting radiotherapy at all or because of huge delays in starting radiation treatment.” She added: “Radiotherapy is one of the most cost-effective and curative cancer treatments we have. It is not a ‘nice to have’, this is a life-saving treatment.” The government needed to urgently invest in more machines and staff and widen access to the treatment. “Otherwise, the UK will remain stuck at the bottom of the cancer survival league tables, and patients will die needlessly.” The findings follow a 2024 study of 780,000 people, comparing treatment for eight different cancers in each UK nation, Norway, Australia and Canada. The   found that people in the UK were less likely to receive radiotherapy and faced considerably longer waits for treatments. Latest NHS England figures show that in July 2025,   to begin treatment, including radiotherapy, and only 39% of patients in England began radiotherapy within 62 days of referral, less than half the national target of 85%. Alison was 64 when she was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer. Faced with a 15-week wait for surgery at her south coast hospital, Alison decided to use her savings and go private. When she found out after the operation that she would have to wait up to six months for the radiotherapy on the  , Alison decided to see if she could be seen quicker somewhere else, as she couldn’t afford any more private treatment. Her consultant referred her to the Christie cancer centre in Manchester, where she received her radiotherapy at the end of June. Alison praised the Christie for the care she received, but said having to travel more than 200 miles for her treatment was a traumatic experience. “You know, I’ve been through a lot in my life, but the mental anguish that I was put through cannot be overestimated,” she said. “Really, it’s horrendous. “I spent a week in Manchester going for radiotherapy every single day. I had to ring the little bell for the end of my treatment on my own, over 200 miles away from my family. That is wrong.” Staff shortages on top of increased demand are behind the delays. According to the Royal College of Radiologists, in 2024, seven in 10 cancer centre leaders  . Experts report that radiotherapy machines are sitting idle in a number of trusts, or are unable to be used at weekends, because no staff are available to operate them. One head of radiotherapy from a large trust in the east of England said the “devastating reality” was that the workforce was at breaking point. “After 35 years in the radiotherapy profession, I can say with certainty that the situation we face today is the worst I’ve ever seen. Across the country, radiotherapy treatment machines sit idle. Not just because of technical faults, but because there simply aren’t enough staff to run them,” they said. Sign up to  Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The crisis is so acute that 91 radiotherapy leaders working across England wrote to the health secretary, Wes Streeting, on Friday calling on the government to prioritise investment in radiotherapy or risk the failure of their forthcoming cancer plan. “Radiotherapy has been held back by historical under-investment and systemic under-prioritisation,” the letter says. “As a result, radiotherapy is often left out of major policy conversations and suffers from outdated equipment, slow technology adoption, chronic workforce shortages and stark regional inequalities. “If we fail to fund and deliver on radiotherapy, [the promise of the government’s cancer plan] will be broken before it even begins.” Mark Lawler, a professor of digital health at Queen’s University Belfast and chair of the International   Benchmarking Partnership, said: “We are global laggards for both access and timeliness of radiotherapy, behind the likes of Denmark, France, and for lung cancer even Labrador and Newfoundland. I never thought I’d hear myself saying that.” Dr Stephen Harden, the president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said most patients faced “agonising radiotherapy delays”. “Amid soaring demand for cancer care, staff shortages and patient delays will only get worse if nothing is done to increase the workforce. While the government has invested in new Linac radiotherapy machines, staff shortages at some cancer centres mean they can’t offer treatment on evenings and weekends.” A Department of   and Social Care spokesperson said: “Too many cancer patients are waiting too long for radiotherapy treatment. This government is taking decisive action to get the NHS diagnosing cancer earlier and treating it faster. “We have already invested £70m in replacing outdated radiotherapy machines across the NHS with cutting-edge technology that will speed up treatment for thousands of patients. We are also addressing workforce shortages, with over 5,800 doctors now working in clinical radiology – almost 200 more than a year ago. Since July 2024, 160,000 more people had cancer diagnosed or ruled out on time. “Our forthcoming national cancer plan will include further details on how we will improve outcomes for cancer patients, including setting out comprehensive improvements to radiotherapy care for patients, such as how we can   to speed up treatment.”", "tags": ["cancer", "nhs", "england", "health", "hospitals", "cancer", "research", "inequality", "news"]},

A study of more than 10,000 young people in the US discovered altered brain development in children from wealthy and lower-income families in areas with higher rates of inequality, which were also associated with poorer mental health. The data was gathered from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study and   Nature Mental Health. Researchers at King’s College London, Harvard University, and the University of York then measured inequality within a particular US state by scoring how evenly income is measured. States with higher levels of inequality included New York, Connecticut, California and Florida, while Utah, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Vermont were more equal. MRI scans were analysed to study the surface area and thickness of regions in the cortex, including those involved in higher cognitive functions including memory, emotion, attention and language. Connections between different regions of the brain were also analysed by the scans, where changes in blood flow indicate brain activity. The research found that children living in areas with higher levels of societal inequality, including socioeconomic imbalances and deprivation for example, were linked to having a reduced surface area of the brain’s cortex, and altered connections between multiple regions of the brain. The findings, the first to reveal the impact societal inequality has on the structures of the brain, also provided evidence that the impacted neurodevelopment might relate to future mental health and cognitive function. Notably, these brain changes in children were seen regardless of their economic background. Dr Divyangana Rakesh, at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and  , King’s College London, said the study was not about individual family income but how income was distributed in society. “Both children from wealthy and lower-income families showed altered neurodevelopment, and we established that this has a lasting impact on wellbeing. We are interested to see how these findings compare around the world,” she said. “For example, several areas in the UK are characterised by high income inequality. London exhibits significant inequality, with both very rich and very poor residents. Future research could examine income inequality in the UK at the level of counties and boroughs to investigate whether similar effects are observed.” The researchers also analysed data from questionnaires taken by the children, with the aim of revealing mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, at ages 10 and 11, six and 18 months after the MRI scans. Mental health outcomes were significantly worse for those who lived in societies with higher levels of wealth inequality. Furthermore, some of the structural changes observed in the children’s brains were linked to functional alterations, which were in turn associated with worse mental health. Prof Vikram Patel of Harvard, a co-author of the study, said the findings added to the “growing literature which demonstrates how social factors, in this instance income inequality, can influence wellbeing through pathways which include structural changes in the brain”. Prof Kate Pickett of the University of York, another co-author of the study, said: “Our paper emphasises that reducing inequality isn’t just about economics – it’s a public health imperative. “The brain changes we observed in regions involved in emotion regulation and attention suggest that inequality creates a toxic social environment that literally shapes how young minds develop, with consequences for mental health and impacts that can last a lifetime. “This is a significant advance in understanding how societal-level inequality gets under the skin to affect mental health.” The study was funded by the Brain and Behaviour Research Foundation, the UKRI Medical Research Council and the National Institute of Mental  .", "tags": ["neuroscience", "medical", "research", "children", "inequality", "children's", "health", "poverty", "social", "exclusion", "news"]},

In a new report, the influential thinktank analyses the Office for National Statistics’ latest wealth and assets survey, which covers the Covid pandemic period of 2020-22. The authors find that in 2006-08, before the global financial crisis, it would have taken 38 years’ worth of median full-time earnings to lift a worker into the top 10th of the wealth distribution. By 2020-22 that gap had widened, so that it would take 52 years of earnings. Molly Broome, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation and the lead author of the report, said: “Wealth gaps in Britain are now so large that a typical full-time employee saving all their earnings across their entire working life would still not be able to reach the top of the wealth ladder.” The gap between the wealth of the average person and someone in the top 10% was £1m in 2006-08, but had widened to £1.3m in real terms by 2020-22, the foundation finds. Broome added: “These gaps are doubly concerning as wealth mobility in Britain is low – people that start life wealthy tend to stay wealthy, and vice versa.” Despite the wealth gap widening in absolute terms, however, the share of total wealth in the UK held by the richest households – known as “relative wealth inequality” – has been “broadly stable since the 1980s”, the thinktank points out. Over that time, total wealth in the UK surged from three times the annual GDP, to almost 7.5 times. So-called “passive” gains, through rising house prices and changes in pension valuations, were the main drivers of the widening wealth gap since 2010, according to the report. These tended to accrue to older, property-owning households, the research shows – worsening the intergenerational wealth divide.

During the pandemic, when millions of workers were protected by the taxpayer-backed furlough scheme, and Covid shutdowns limited opportunities for spending, the data shows many households were able to save, increasing their wealth. Higher-income households fared much better, however. “The typical family in the lowest-income quintile saw their liquid savings increase by just £80 over the pandemic period (2019-20 to 2021-22), broadly the same as the two years pre-pandemic.

When voters shout, ministers jump to and blurt out a reply, no matter how bad. But there is one problem above any other that Britons say causes them personal distress. It is pushing many to desperate action. It’s the same issue that may well seal the next election. It’s no secret, but instead regularly flashes deepest red in polls. Yet it is neither discussed by our prime minister nor receives urgent ministerial attention. And no newspaper is bawling about it in 72-point type. Here is a case study in just how warped politics and the media are in 2025, and how MPs and journalists work against the interests of their voters and audiences. I refer to the cost of living. Mention it in Westminster, and your audience will think you are regurgitating recent history. The cost of living crisis? Wasn’t that Liz and Rishi’s bag? After Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, and skittled energy markets in the process. Huge public anger; a costly giveaway; many glittering careers sacrificed. Prime fodder, surely, for a cracking episode of The Rest is History. But for most other Britons, this isn’t the stuff of memories. They are still in a cost of living crisis. Whether at Ocado or Aldi, food prices keep rising. School uniforms are extortionate. University tuition fees for the new term – jacked up. And last week the cap on energy bills was hiked – just in time for winter. Almost four years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices rocketing, the average British family is still under huge financial stress. True, the Bank of England is no longer panicking about inflation now that it has gone from double digits to hovering around “only” 4%. But that’s little comfort for most households, who can see there are fewer bags in their weekly shop – and that their pay (up by 20% since 2021) hasn’t kept up with either prices ( ) or fuel bills (which have typically risen by almost  ). Whenever the polling company More in Common asks voters to list the main problems facing the UK, the  . What about immigration? It’s rising, and some other pollsters put it just ahead of cost of living. But when voters are asked the biggest issues in their day to day lives, cost of living or financial pressures come way out in front. So here is the UK’s No 1 political problem: rising bills. You may have heard it come up at the school gate or at a local bus stop. You may be among the 58% of British households  . In which case, you will have been almost ignored by leading politicians. “Westminster treats the cost of living as an issue from two years ago; they’ve moved on,” says Chris Annous at More in Common. “But for the rest of Britain it’s still their biggest issue.” At focus groups, he’s noticed that wherever the venue and whatever the subject, those attending can’t stop bringing up the cost of living. From men’s health to green spaces, they all come back to bills. In Liverpool last week,   gave his big speech the day before energy regulators raised the cap. The cost of living got mentioned twice in the whole thing. Patriotism? Five times. And flags? Well, there was a whole section on those, along with a dreamy peroration on the England football team in 1996. “An England that belonged to our grandparents and our history,” cried the prime minister. But this imagined England never seems to have room for the people working all the hours and wondering why they have more month than money. Perhaps even raising the omission now counts as un-British. In this great displacement of political attention, at the centre is the media. I asked the Guardian’s research department to count up the number of stories in national newspapers about asylum seekers or small boats or refugees. They found 542 in just the past month. And how many on the cost of living or essentials or living standards? Just 45. About 33,000 people have crossed the Channel so far this year. We can talk another time about the  , but just on the numbers that is a number almost insignificant besides the   on their fuel bills and with no repayment plan. Dealing with the high prices of housing, food, utilities and transport would require real politics, rather than the fake politics of waving St George’s flags and locking up pensioners for mentioning Palestine Action. But if   ministers carry on pretending that they are helpless to tackle high prices in the face of the markets, they will pay an extortionate political price. A grab bag of means-tested benefits and breakfast clubs at school won’t do it, and extending childcare was actually Jeremy Hunt’s wheeze. It’s already those most financially fearful who are deserting Labour – and the numbers in financial distress are set to grow. Sign up to  Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more after newsletter promotion Last month, economists at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) published some extraordinary   between now and the next election. Most governments that serve a full term preside over a rise in living standards of just over 10%. The exception so far appears to be the reign of Boris Johnson/Liz Truss/Rishi Sunak, where living standards look to have stayed the same for the entire five years. That explains a lot of the political volatility, but what lies ahead looks likely to be a lot worse. Taking household incomes after taxes and inflation and housing costs and mapping them against official projections for the economy, they found that unless Labour acted very soon, it was likely to preside over an outright shrinkage in British living standards. This has never happened since records began. It would mean Britons had suffered a decade of no improvement to their living standards. Forget all the missions, forget the promises of change: the typical family would be worse off – and the poorest families would really suffer, losing more than £1,000 a year in disposable income. “If anything is going to finish this Labour government, it will be the cost of living,” says Alfie Stirling, director of insight and policy at JRF. “Too many people seeing too little improvement in their day-to-day lives and livelihood.” And in that vast gulf between what ministers are talking about and what’s gnawing away at voters at night, you have the conditions not just for the wipeout of a Labour government but for destabilising an entire democracy. As a motto for government, “let them eat flags” has the ring of other regimes that ended badly. Because when people see that the system offers them no improvement and their kids no hope, why wouldn’t they choose to smash up the entire thing?

So the sense of responsibility that comes with the task of building a team the state of Colorado can be proud is one staff there are acutely aware of. Principally, that mission has been assigned to Nick Cushing, the former Manchester City women’s and New York City men’s team head coach, who was  , six months before they embark on their first NWSL campaign, when the division expands to 16 sides in February. It is not hard to see the logic behind the choice; the Englishman was in charge of City when they were new to an expanded Women’s Super League in 2014, with new signings such as Steph Houghton, Jill Scott and Toni Duggan. They went on to win a League Cup in their first top-flight season and the league title in 2016. The difference this time is Denver have an entirely blank canvas for Cushing to work on and, with his new colleagues, he has been scouring the global market in search of players and staff. “It’s a bit like a jigsaw puzzle; you start by putting one piece in and then as you start to put more pieces in, the picture starts to become clearer,” the 40-year-old says. “Not having any players means you can shape the mentality, culture and ambition of the team. “I know the types of people that I work best with and that get the best out of me; it’s about work ethic, having real hunger and ambition to want to win, and people who want to actually take responsibility for the culture and environment, not just come and live in it.” Denver’s first three signings, forwards Ally Watt and Nahikari García, and midfielder Lourdes Bosch, are all on loan, at Orlando Pride, Nottingham Forest and Monterrey Femenil respectively, before training begins in mid-January. “[You want] players who have experienced NWSL, experiencing winning,” says Cushing. “[It’s] exactly the same with staff. We’re recruiting staff we feel are really good people but who also have knowledge of good and bad times within the league. “I was clear with the owners; I won’t come with my own staff. I’m going to build a staff. I don’t need a staffing group to come and make me feel comfortable and confident. I want to build the best staff with the skills to help Denver become a winning team as quickly as possible.” Denver’s owners includes some of the biggest names in American sport, including Mikaela Shiffrin, statistically the most successful alpine skier of all time, and the five-time NFL MVP, Peyton Manning, both of whom have strong links to the local area. The ownership group, led by the American businessman Rob Cohen, spent a league-record $110m to join the NWSL, and Cushing cannot help but feel excited about what lays ahead. “The first game, the first goal, the first win, these are going to be historical moments,” he says. “We had a fun event on Saturday and the energy was electric, with three and a half thousand fans turning up just to buy merchandise and sing songs. It is so unique.” Despite his optimistic mood, Cushing is taking a calm approach in regards to expectations for Denver’s debut NWSL season. “We just want to be competitive,” he says. “When I reflect now on the pre-season before 2014’s season with Manchester City, I thought we were going to win the league, play great football and dominate everybody. Then our first game was just a haze and I remember getting on the bus thinking: ‘Thank God we only lost 1-0.’ I wasn’t prepared and did a lot of learning through that season as a 29-year-old coach.

In his second spell at City, on an interim basis in the latter part of last season after the sacking of Gareth Taylor, Cushing oversaw four wins in 10 games which included a Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea. Reflecting on his short-term return, he adds: “I loved it, leading the team in front of our fans in Manchester was amazing. “I really enjoyed it but was disappointed I couldn’t push the team on. One thing it did – and I’m not afraid to say this – is it gave me a real appetite for that Champions League again. I have full focus here on Denver and I definitely want to win the NWSL, but I still have a desire after being in two Champions League semi-finals in my first tenure, so it is definitely something I want to do in my future, take that Champions League on again.” Right now Cushing is more than happy in Denver, a city where the peaks of the Rocky Mountains rise in the background and somewhere he hopes to take his children skiing.

Greer’s cheap shot, punished with only a $2,000 fine, broke hockey’s unspoken code: you never go after a player with a known concussion history, especially one you’ve already injured. So on Saturday, Tampa iced a lineup of AHL enforcers and spent the night exacting frontier justice. The league’s  ? Heavy fines and suspensions for the Lightning, none for Florida. The ugly scenes revived an old suspicion: that the NHL’s disciplinary system protects its favorites. The Panthers’ connections only make the optics worse. The league’s director of hockey operations, Colin Campbell, is a longtime power broker whose son is a minority owner and assistant general manager of – you guessed it – the Panthers. The head of player safety, George Parros, is a former Panther himself. A decade ago Campbell’s leaked emails   for not giving Florida preferential treatment. Nothing changed. Across the  , this latest bloodbath looked like business as usual: a vivid reminder that hockey’s old-boy network pulls the strings on a two-tiered system of justice. The bad blood has been brewing for years. For most of their existence the Panthers were an afterthought, overshadowed by the more successful Lightning, who won the first of their three Stanley Cups in 2004. Then they traded for Matthew Tkachuk – a brilliant, agitating forward – and hired a coach who encouraged the chaos. Overnight, the franchise became an almost comically ratty heel team: relentlessly annoying, gleefully abrasive and somehow good enough to win anyway. They ran goalies, took liberties after whistles, and seemed to delight in their role as the villains of modern hockey. Tampa, by contrast, had built their dynasty on cool precision: a team that mixed speed, skill and structure to win back-to-back Cups in 2020 and 2021. To Lightning fans, Florida’s rise represented something else: the triumph of cynicism, of hockey as provocation rather than craft. The long-simmering tensions finally exploded in April’s postseason meeting. When Hagel flattened Barkov with what looked like a clean shoulder check – a hockey play at playoff speed gone wrong – the officials ruled it illegal because Barkov hadn’t touched the puck. Hagel was slapped with a one-game suspension. The next night Ekblad, who’d already served a lengthy ban earlier in the season for performance-enhancing drugs, hunted him down and delivered a full-force shot to the head, concussing him – a retaliatory hit that earned just two games. Florida went on to win the series and their second straight Cup, while Tampa were left muttering about double standards. So when Greer targeted Hagel again – during a meaningless September preseason game, no less – the Lightning saw red. Coach Jon Cooper rested his stars and called up six players from the minors – two known enforcers among them – to ice a full lineup without exposing his smaller, skilled forwards. Within minutes, 32-year-old bruiser Scott Sabourin   that dropped him to his knees. From there the night descended into absurdity: brawls after nearly every whistle, fights in the penalty box, more than 300 combined penalty minutes and so many ejections that both teams ended with nine skaters. At one point, Florida’s Niko Mikkola even picked up an assist despite having been sent off minutes earlier. It’s not every night an ejected player somehow helps to extend an 8-0 lead before anyone notices. The next day, the discipline meted out by the NHL’s department of player safety came down squarely on Tampa. Six players fined, two suspended, the organization docked $100,000 and Cooper fined another $25,000. Florida’s Greer kept his token $2,000 fine. The perception was plain as day: the Panthers could do no wrong. And that sense of impunity is what has turned a once-anodyne cross-state rivalry into something much darker: a microcosm of how the NHL still protects its insiders and punishes its critics. That defiance fits neatly with the Panthers’ broader identity. Under owner Vincent Viola – a billionaire financier and   for secretary of the army – the franchise has cultivated an overtly Maga aesthetic. After their first Cup win, team executives proudly visited Trump at the White House, presenting him with a custom “45–47” jersey. Viola’s longtime business partner and minority owner Douglas Cifu, the Panthers’ vice-chairman and alternate governor, also runs Virtu Financial, the high-frequency trading firm he co-founded with Viola. In May, Cifu was suspended indefinitely by the NHL after   with a Canadian fan where he invoked the Israel-Palestine conflict and Trump’s 51st state taunts, a move that did little to distance the team from its hard-right image. Across the state, the Lightning’s ownership has taken the opposite tack: removing a Robert E Lee statue from downtown Tampa, supporting diversity initiatives and hosting some of the league’s most inclusive heritage nights. In miniature, the Battle of Florida now mirrors the United States itself: grievance and aggression on one side, progressive branding on the other, both locked in a fight over what the sport, and the country, should be. The irony is that all this has unfolded during what’s meant to be the NHL’s modern age of enlightenment. League executives boast about player safety and mental-health awareness, and evolving beyond the blood-and-guts spectacle of decades past. Yet its disciplinary machinery still operates with the opaque impunity of an old boys’ club. When New York Rangers owner James Dolan   the league’s refusal to suspend Washington’s Tom Wilson in 2021, the NHL didn’t revisit the call; it   for daring to question it. Commissioner Gary Bettman scolded the Rangers for “demeaning” a league executive and declared such criticism “unacceptable”. The message was clear enough: silence is rewarded, dissent is punished and the culture that enables violence is the one most fiercely protected. This time, though, the silence has cracked. Around the league, executives and players are said to be quietly rooting for Tampa – not because they condone vigilante justice, but because they recognize the futility of appealing to a system stacked against them. The Panthers may have won the Stanley Cup for two years running, but they’ve also become the embodiment of a league that rewards swagger and punishes accountability. That the NHL’s biggest controversy of the year erupted before a single regular-season game had been played says it all. The sport that keeps promising to modernize still can’t stop celebrating its own anarchy: a league where power, not principle, decides who gets away with what – and who gets left bleeding on the ice.", "tags": ["nhl", "florida", "panthers", "tampa", "bay", "lightning", "us", "sports", "ice", "hockey", "features"]},

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/10/what-does-gaza-deal-hamas-mean-for-benjamin-netanyahu-future", "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu repeated his pledge to force Hamas to disarm in a defiant and combative speech on Friday just an hour after a ceasefire began in Gaza. In a  , Israel’s prime minister said he had resisted intense domestic and international pressure to achieve his aim of ensuring “the security of Israel”, and he lambasted his critics and reiterated a threat to return to war if necessary. “Hamas agreed to the deal only when it felt the sword resting on its neck and it is still on its neck … Hamas will be disarmed and   will be demilitarised … If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better. And if not, it will be achieved the hard way,” Netanyahu said. The deal signed early on Thursday and implemented on Friday will lead to Hamas releasing   within 72 hours, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of Gaza, and freedom for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Further steps are still unclear. In his address, Netanyahu said achieving security for   meant “breaking the Iranian axis, of which Hamas is a central component”, suggesting he had achieved this over the 24 months of relentless conflict. Analysts described it as an election speech. “He is always campaigning. In every speech it is ‘I ordered this’, ‘I ordered that’. It’s always me, me, me … That’s what he does best,” said Yossi Mekelberg, a specialist in Israeli politics at London’s Chatham House thinktank. Netanyahu’s popularity has not recovered substantially since the 7 October 2023 Hamas raid that triggered the war in Gaza. The attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, with another 250 taken hostage. Since then, even slight boosts for Netanyahu and his Likud party – after military campaigns against Hezbollah in Lebanon last year and Iran in June – have come only at the expense of other members of the current ruling coalition, the most rightwing in Israel’s history. Elections in Israel are due within about a year and most observers expect them within six months. The most recent survey, published on Friday by Ma’ariv, an Israel newspaper, showed widespread support for the ceasefire and hostage release among Israelis had boosted Likud by only two seats, and that the current coalition would still face defeat by a wide margin. Far-right ministers, who have long sworn to collapse the current government if the war was brought to an end without the   and Israeli control of all of Gaza, have so far yet to make good their threat. In the Ma’ariv survey, almost half of respondents wanted a vote as soon as possible. Anshel Pfeffer, the Economist’s Israel correspondent and a biographer of Netanyahu, said: “Bibi [a widely used nickname for Netanyahu] has been forced to accept this is the end of the war, even if he won’t use those specific words … so now he is going to make the best of the situation. Everything is good for Bibi. “Even at 75, he cannot conceive of life outside the prime minister’s office … and [to hold on to power] would be a vindication as the man who destroyed the Iranian axis, not the man responsible for October 7. I don’t think there is a scenario where he goes off to look after his rosebushes.” The coming weeks will bring further challenges for Netanyahu, who has held power in Israel for 18 years in total, longer than David Ben-Gurion, considered the country’s founding father. He faces corruption charges that could lead to a ban on public office or even jail, and will also face new calls for a full judicial inquiry into the failures that allowed for Hamas’s 2023 raid. Any ceasefire in Gaza is likely to be fragile, and implementing thornier parts of Donald Trump’s plan, including many elements that favour Israel, will be extremely difficult. The key for Netanyahu will be to convince Israelis that he remains “Mr Security” despite the worst security disaster in the country’s history occurring on his watch. The ringing endorsement Trump is expected to offer when he speaks to the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, on Monday will help. Udi Tenne, a strategic adviser and international campaign manager who has worked with top leaders in Israel, said: “Netanyahu is the central story of this war … Today, Israel finds itself in the strongest security position in its history: there is no Syrian threat, Hezbollah has suffered a severe blow and so have Iran and Hamas. Netanyahu’s likely message will be: we fell asleep, but we rose in full force – and we defeated all of Israel’s enemies.” Despite the costs of the war in Gaza,   and domestic divisions, the broader political landscape may still favour Netanyahu. Any opposition is fragmented. Lahav Harkov, a senior political correspondent at the US-based Jewish Insider, said Israel and its politicians had shifted to the right. “Israelis don’t seem to have much of an appetite for the peacenik stuff at the moment,” Harkov said. “It may not seem logical, but the central question in Israeli politics is still the same as it has been for a long time: yes Bibi, or no Bibi?”", "tags": ["benjamin", "netanyahu", "israel", "israel-gaza", "war", "gaza", "palestine", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "news"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/09/nfl-mvp-contenders", "content": "here has been a trend in recent   seasons. Around Week 8, the MVP race starts to follow a predictable script: Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson (if the Ravens are rolling) will almost certainly feature. Between 2015 and 2019, the NFL had four first-time MVP winners – Cam Newton, Matt Ryan, Mahomes and Jackson. But in the last five years, only Allen has been a first-time winner (Aaron Rodgers, Mahomes and Jackson were the other victors). Allen is favorite to go back-to-back this season, which would make it five times in the last six years the league has crowned a previous winner. But voters experience fatigue; everyone wants a fresh star. And this year’s list of first-time candidates feels unusually deep and unusually fun. Maybe these guys won’t win   year, but let’s look at the players who could break up the Mahomes-Allen-Jackson triumvirate in the next few seasons. A few notes: the ratings below are for the players’ chances of winning the award in the next few years, not specifically this season. We’ve also left out perennial contenders like Joe Burrow, Matthew Stafford and Dak Prescott in favor of some longer shots. It’s no longer a joke: Darnold is one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. In Minnesota, it was easy to scoff at his ascent. You could point to the schematic environment and his excellent supporting cast. That’s not the case in Seattle. The Seahawks’ run game has yet to gel. The offensive line is improved, but still lags behind the league’s best. Jaxon Smith-Njigba has been one of the five best receivers in the league this year, but has been elevated by the decision-making and accuracy of Darnold. Seattle have retooled their offense around Darnold, who is still only 28 (younger than Burrow, who was drafted two years later). They hunt chunk plays, banking on Darnold’s arm to push the ball down the field. In that role, he looks more like Stafford than the Darnold we saw during his Jets years. Early in his career, Darnold struggled when pressured, staring down the rush and gagging away costly turnovers. He’s stripped much of that fat from his game.  , now he is creating plays when his protection breaks down or the structure of the offense is off. Sam Darnold has come a long way since those days he was seeing ghosts This is flow State  Bounce through whatever quarterback metric you like, and Darnold is at the top, or near the top, of the list. He leads the league in the RBSDM composite, which pieces together the value of every offensive play and measures how much a quarterback can be deemed responsible for that value. Whoever tops that number by the end of the year typically winds up in the final three in MVP voting. Through five weeks, Darnold has proved last season in Minnesota was no fluke. This is who he is now, and that’s been an upgrade for Seattle over Geno Smith. If he can lead the Seahawks to a division title, the redemption narrative will carry him into the conversation with Allen and Mahomes.  7/10. This year could be his best chance to win it. Speaking of redemption arcs. There was a time when the Panthers employed Baker Mayfield   Darnold. Oof. Mayfield has gone from  in Carolina to franchise quarterback in Tampa Bay. The MVP is, to an extent, a narrative award, and few have a cooler story than Mayfield. Burrow, Stafford and Prescott are better quarterbacks. But there is something about his story that should garner extra credit among voters. Multiple franchises gave up on him before he arrived in Tampa. He’s had three different offensive coordinators in the last three seasons, but has continued to pilot the Bucs offense at the highest level. Mayfield hasn’t been as clean this year as he was in 2024. Down to down, he’s been a little scattershot. But he’s working in a tricky environment: Tampa’s run game has stalled, and the offensive line has been weakened by injuries. Yet despite those problems, Mayfield is playing the best all-around ball of his career. He’s already led the Bucs to four game-winning drives this season and he leads the league in Big Time Throw Rate, according to Pro Football Focus. He is doing more with less, including waltzing into Seattle with a beat-up line and   on one of the best defenses in football (though one that had plenty of injury issues to deal with of its own). In a time before advanced analytics, Mayfield would be leading this year’s race. He has put his team on his back more than any other quarterback in crunch time. Voters still value that stuff, but not quite to the same degree they did in the 1990s and early 2000s.  4/10. His gambler style will lead him to throw a few games away. Daniels returned from injury against the Chargers on Sunday and reminded everyone why, last season, he was   to enter the league in a generation. Daniels shredded the Chargers in the second half on the road, lifting the Commanders to a comfortable win in LA. It hasn’t been the smoothest start to his second season. The Commanders’ team-building approach around Daniels has been peculiar. They’ve tried to fast-track success, recognizing they’ve hit on something special with a quarterback on a cheap rookie contract. But they’re left with the oldest roster in the league by some distance. And it shows, particularly on defense. Over the medium term, Washington’s roster construction could ding Daniels. But he remains a one-man supernova at the game’s most valuable position. He is the closest quarterback in the league to Jackson: a precision passer who is also electric with the ball in his hands as a runner. If he can push the Commanders past the Eagles at the top of the NFC East in the next couple of years, he will be a lock for the award. : 8/10. The surest player from his vaunted rookie class to win in the next three years. It was all going so well for Herbert and the Chargers. Two weeks into the season, it felt like this was his year. Finally, the pieces around him were slotted into place. And the Chargers had shifted to a Herbert-centric offense, turning from a run-focused group into a passing one. It was as if Jim Harbaugh set out with the goal of winning Herbert the MVP award just as much as he was looking to dethrone the Chiefs in the AFC West. That’s changed. The Chargers have lost too many pieces along their offensive line. They dropped a winnable game against the Giants and were hammered along both sides of the line of scrimmage by the Commanders. The degree of difficulty for Herbert at this point, this season, is too high. Even to keep the chains moving, he has to strap on his superhero cape. That’s fun in small samples – and valuable for the MVP award when it comes under a national spotlight – but unsustainable over the slog of a regular season. Herbert has MVP talent. When the Chargers are healthy, he is the favorite for the award among the players on this list. He fits the billing: the rule of new, the playmaking, the winning. He passes the eye test and holds a monopoly over some of the fanciest metrics. But it won’t be this year.  9/10. Eventually, the Chargers will stay healthy, and Herbert will break through. The MVP is a quarterback award – the last non-QB to win it was Adrian Peterson in the 2012 season. Still, playing on both sides of the ball is a big help for anyone trying to upset the quarterback cartel. It’s been an inauspicious start for Hunter as a two-way phenom. The Jags have bounced back and forth between primarily using him on offense and defense. Last week, they settled on a 40-snap rotation on either side of the ball. And that feels like the right figure for a rookie trying to get up to the speed of the pro game while learning a complex offense and the league’s most disguise-laden defense. TRAVIS HUNTER OMG 😱 WHAT A CATCH FOR THE ROOKIE 🔥  Hunter has been fine as a rookie, but he hasn’t been an instant gamechanger. There have been flashes of the talent that made him the Heisman winner, but he has yet to take over a game while playing both ways. At some point, the Jags may settle on using him on one side while only bringing him on the field for select packages the other way. But that’s not the plan at the moment. That may make Hunter’s development curve steeper, but it also ups his MVP potential. Who else could realistically have double-digit touchdowns as a receiver while also grabbing five or more takeaways? If Hunter realizes   on both sides of the ball, voters will look past the quarterbacks. 5/10. The only “defensive” player who has a sniff. Maye burst into the national spotlight with his performance on the road in Buffalo on Sunday. But he has been steadily putting together an MVP campaign all season. The Patriots are fourth in the league in passing efficiency this year. A lot of that has to do with the return of Josh McDaniels. The offensive coordinator has schemed up wide-open receivers all over the place. But it also speaks to Maye’s development. He’s cut down his brain-farts-per-game from four to two. He’s mastering the easy things. And when the offense falls apart and he’s asked to create on his own, he looks like a mini Josh Allen. The advanced data paints him as the   in the league this season. And it’s hard to disagree. His accuracy has improved. He doesn’t throw interceptions. He can rip it to all parts of the field and he is a legitimate dual-threat. Oh, and he’s doing it with a so-so offensive line, a crop of running backs who continually fumble, and a blah batch of receivers outside Stefon Diggs. This year may be a season too early. But the Patriots  make the playoffs, given their start and upcoming schedule. As they continue to add talent, Maye’s chances will grow. He’s working on the Allen timeline. Wildcard time. If Allen, Mahomes and Jackson continue to share the MVP award among themselves, the next first-time winner may not even be in the league yet. Every year when the draft rolls around, prognosticators will tell fanbases not to worry about that year’s crop of shaky quarterback talent.  Some organizations always seem to be waiting for the next mass influx of talented QBs. Last year was no different, but the 2026 draft class has so far disappointed. Arch Manning, Garrett Nussmeier and LaNorris Sellers, shoo-ins to be high draft picks before the season, have struggled. There is no sure-fire No 1 pick, but rather a crop of eight talented yet flawed prospects that teams are considering at the top of the draft. Excuse me what now I have no idea how Jaron Keawe Sagapolutele fitted this throw in for Trond Grizzell sheesh  So let’s punt even further down the road. The most exciting quarterback in college this year is Sagapolutele, a true freshman at Cal. The Hawaiian transferred out of Oregon after losing a quarterback battle to Dante Moore – a potential future No 1 overall pick – and already looks the part of a future franchise quarterback. A lefty, Sagapolutele is the kind of intelligent, decisive, pocket passer that pro teams covet. He also happens to have a rocket for an arm and is an explosive runner. Sagapolutele will not be eligible to enter the draft until 2028. That means he won’t enter real MVP conversations for at least five years, if he continues on his current trajectory.

I offer my condolences to her and her family. There is no denying the genocide in Gaza, the inhumane treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli government, and the disgusting lack of Israeli empathy (I was horrified watching the recent video of one of your reporters  ). Yet this bizarre tribalism on either side astonishes me. I am horrified by the suffering in Gaza and by the suffering of 7 October – am I not allowed to feel for all civilians, for every life taken? Am I not allowed to mourn for children shot in Gaza and mourn for children shot by Hamas? You would think not, from the sort of vitriol I come across daily in comments on TikTok videos. I relate, too, to Sharone’s descriptions of those who have become so staunchly against   that they support Hamas. To align yourself with an organisation that slaughters civilians, while asking for peace in Gaza and deploring the violence of the Israel Defense Forces, is insane. Using Israel’s past violence is not justification for the slaughter of civilians, just as Hamas’s actions are not justification for the genocide in Gaza. It is categorically wrong to align the actions of a government with the value of its civilians’ lives. I don’t see anyone offering the same vitriol as they do for Israel to, say, Russia or China, where monstrosities have occurred against Ukrainians and Uyghurs. The rising antisemitism is bleak, the masses apparently unable to separate Jews and Israelis. I saw a TikTok video of two girls eating matzo for Passover earlier this year, with no mention of Israel at all (and why would there be?). The comment thread was flooded with hate, as if they had done something wrong by simply being Jewish. One, simple in its hatred, just said “demons”. It is very sad that we live in a world with so much hate and violence. I can only hope that Sharone’s mother is correct, and that there is a brighter future on the horizon for all.", "tags": ["israel-gaza", "war", "antisemitism", "palestine", "family", "israel", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "letters"]},

It will be game 72 in office for Clarke, surpassing Craig Brown as Scotland’s longest-serving manager in terms of matches. Clarke’s big picture involves World Cup qualification, with Scotland in a strong position, but he can appreciate his longevity. “I’d be a bit daft if I wasn’t proud because I’m the first guy to reach that amount of games,” he said. “It’s nice, but that’s a little personal thing at the moment. It shouldn’t be about me. It’s about the team and it’s about trying to get to the World Cup so that’s what we’re going to focus on. “The brief was to qualify for tournaments. We’ve managed to do that twice, but we want to do it again because we’re all greedy. The expectation was to do as well as I could. I’ve always looked at the players and you’re thinking: ‘What can we do to improve?’ Did I think it would last this long? Probably not, but here I am.”  on Thursday means they trail Denmark on goal difference in Group C. With matches in Athens and at home to the Danes to come, Clarke will be hoping for a comfortable evening against Belarus. Denmark put six past them on Thursday but Clarke said his squad cannot be complacent. “If you want to qualify, these are the games you have to win,. You have to give yourself a platform to play against the bigger nations. If you drop points to the teams ranked below you, it makes qualification very difficult. If you look at our barren years, maybe we messed up against opposition we felt we should have been beating. “In my tenure we’ve done well against the so-called lesser teams in the groups and it’s very important you get the points off these teams. It’s very important we get the points off Belarus. They’ll come here, they’ll be organised, they’ll be difficult to break down and until you break them down it’s a long night. “They’ll make it difficult but it’s up to us to make sure that we approach the game properly, which we will. It’s up to us to make sure that we create enough chances in the game to get the crowd excited, which we hopefully will.

Gewan, the 25-1 winner of the season’s most prestigious two-year-old race, had looked every inch a Classic prospect in his first two starts before finishing a lacklustre fourth as the 6-5 favourite for the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster last month. He returned to his earlier form in no uncertain terms under a confident ride by James Doyle, who was soon settled close to the early lead before grabbing a decisive advantage with a move to the front a furlong-and-a-half out. Gewan, who runs in the green colours of the Chinese billionaire Zhang Yuesheng, crossed the line three-quarters of a length in front of the 7-4 favourite, Gstaad, foiling Aidan O’Brien’s tilt at a record ninth Dewhurst success. That Gstaad’s main market rival, Distant Storm, was another length-and-a-half away in third, with Zavateri, a Group One winner this season, fourth also gives a solid feel to the form. Gewan’s path through his juvenile season has also been a carbon-copy of that taken by Chaldean, the  , in his two-year-old campaign three years ago. Andrew Balding’s colt is now top-priced at 12-1 to give the trainer a third win in the colts’ Classic since 2020. “We were saying coming into the race that he was overpriced,” Balding said. “His York performance [in the Acomb Stakes] was really good and you’ve got to forgive him Doncaster. So we weren’t without hope, but he’s still got to come and do it, he was given a brilliant ride and he’s a very good horse.” Gewan’s owner bought into the colt after his impressive win in the Acomb, and took the subsequent failure at Town Moor in his stride. “They’re very straightforward and they took the defeat at Doncaster without flinching, having just bought the horse,” Balding said. “That enabled us to just kick on and stick with the plan we wanted, and that’s the reason he’s here. “The soft ground didn’t help at Doncaster, but I don’t think it was just that. For whatever reason, he wasn’t at his best, but he was today. It’s a relief, but his work at home suggested he would play a part today.” As a son of Night Of Thunder, the  , Gewan is far from guaranteed to get the Derby trip, but a mile-and-a-half at Epsom promises to be ideal for Pierre Bonnard, the winner of the 10-furlong Zetland Stakes. O’Brien’s colt is by Camelot, the  , and an impressive physical specimen already with plenty of scope for further progress over the winter. The May festival at Chester is seven months away, but it is easy to see Pierre Bonnard as a leading member of O’Brien’s squad for a meeting where he trialled Lambourn and Minnie Hauk,   and Oaks winners respectively, this year. 1.32 Deep Purple 2.07 Settle Down Jill 2.42 Blueking D’Oroux 3.17 Celtic Dino 3.52 Saint Segal 4.27 Bubble Dubi 5.02 Cooltobecareless. 1.52 Spiced Rum 2.27 Funlover 3.02 Crazee Icon 3.37 Righthere Rightnow (nb) 4.12 Poseidon’s Warrior 4.47 Knights Gold 5.22 Day Of Grace (nap). “He was a little green, but Christophe [Soumillon] was very happy with him and he’s a very straightforward horse,” O’Brien said. “I think he’ll be a Derby trial horse and we’ll go from there, but I imagine he is going to really do well over the winter months.” The Zetland is the only British Group race for juveniles at a trip beyond a mile but Soumillon reported that Pierre Bonnard, a general 16-1 chance for next year’s Derby, still had plenty left at the post. “When I started to ask him to pick up at the four-furlong marker, he changed gear really easily,” Soumillon said. “He still had plenty of power after the line so I’m sure he will be some horse next season.”", "tags": ["horse", "racing", "horse", "racing", "tips", "news"]},

Vacherot continued his fairytale by toppling an injured   6-3, 6-4 to become the lowest-ranked Masters 1000 finalist. In his first match against a top-five opponent, the Monégasque world No 204 maintained his composure as Djokovic appeared to struggle with his left gluteal muscle from early in the first set. Vacherot’s tournament has been an incredible spectacle by itself, but it has been made even more remarkable by the events in the top half of the draw. His cousin Rinderknech, a more established name on the ATP tour at No 54, put together the best result of his career. The Frenchman edged past the former world No 1 Daniil Medvedev 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the second semi-final on Saturday. As Rinderknech closed out his victory, Vacherot walked on to the court holding his head in disbelief before embracing his cousin. “I can’t even say it’s a dream because I don’t think even one person in our family dreamed about it,” Rinderknech said. “We started believing it, I would say, in the quarters, maybe … Now we are here, we fought through so many matches and somehow we are the guys standing at the end. It’s just incredible.” The second-lowest direct entrant into the qualifying draw, Vacherot has put together one of the most surprising successes at a big tournament, winning eight matches over the past two weeks. That has included victories over the No 14 seed, Alexander Bublik, and Holger Rune, the 10th seed, alongside this giantkilling win over Djokovic, the fourth seed. “This is just crazy,” Vacherot said on court. “It was an hour and 40 minutes of pure joy, even though not many people wanted me to keep going. He’s really appreciated here. I got a bit lost in all his titles when they were announcing him, but it was an unreal experience.” While Vacherot’s career-high ranking sits at No 110, the second and third lowest-ranked Masters 1000 semi-finalists, No 191 Andrei Pavel and No 152 Borna Coric, were former top 20 players who had dropped down the rankings. Nothing like this has happened at a Masters 1000 event on the ATP tour. The cousins, who played college tennis in the US for the Texas A&M Aggies, have been encouraging each other in China. After closing out the victory, Vacherot signed the a TV camera lens: “Aggies on top! Allez, Arthur!” Vacherot’s joy contrasted sharply with Djokovic’s misery as the 38-year-old continued to battle his own body. This had already been a challenging week for the Serb, who had suffered badly in the suffocating heat and humidity during the opening rounds, vomiting several times on court. It appeared he had recovered from those early difficulties, but it became clear early on that he was struggling. Djokovic took a medical time out at 3-4 in the first set and, despite the crowd urging him on, he was unable to move properly. Sign up to  Sign up to Sport in Focus after newsletter promotion Facing an injured player can still be challenging, particularly when that opponent is Djokovic, and Vacherot held his nerve in a protracted final game. He looked apologetic as he shook Djokovic’s hands, but the Serb admirably offered him encouragement during their embrace: “You deserve it. You deserve it, man. You played unbelievable,” he said. Djokovic had been attempting to become the oldest Masters 1000 champion, he had already become the oldest quarter-finalist at this level. He has shown this year he is still the third-best in the world behind the untouchable duo of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. However, there is a reason why nobody at his age has achieved the milestones he continues to reach. The countless physical problems Djokovic has struggled with between his positive performances this year have further underlined the difficulty of continuing to compete at the highest level. In some ways, Djokovic may reflect even more bitterly on this result than some of his recent grand slam losses. While he has been outplayed by Alcaraz and Sinner in the past three major tournaments, things finally   this week after Alcaraz withdrew because of the ankle injury he sustained during his Tokyo title run and then   against Tallon Griekspoor due to the punishing conditions. Djokovic has recognised Alcaraz and Sinner are levels above him at the moment, but if he continues to put himself in good positions he could give himself a few more opportunities to achieve great things. This week represented one of those opportunities for the 24-time grand slam champion, who has not won a Masters 1000 event since 2023. Instead, his body failed him again. Meanwhile, the Wuhan Open will have an all-American final as Jessica Pegula exacted revenge for her recent US Open semi-final loss to Aryna Sabalenka, narrowly beating the world No 1 2-6, 6-4, 7-6(2).

Erling Haaland stole the attention with a hat-trick on it, rendering his early double penalty miss a discordant memory, and the upshot was that Norway could look with clear heads toward a near-certain first   appearance in 27 years. A win over Estonia next month will confirm their presence; Egil Olsen, their manager at France 1998, watched as Israel offered scant opposition to Europe’s most ruthless attacking force. It also means Italy, already sore from successive failures to qualify, are likely to face another playoff date. Perhaps Norway’s domination of Group I should prove little surprise: the   manager, Ran Ben Shimon, said afterwards that they and Spain are the two best teams on the continent. Israel are now out of contention for next summer’s showpiece; in truth, for all the American government’s outrage about any potential ban from the tournament, it had always been a long shot. But their very presence in Oslo was highly contested, the buildup framed by the Norwegian Football Federation’s stance that they should be ejected from international football due to the war in Gaza. There will be relief that confrontations were minimal beyond a brief spate of trouble outside the Ullevaal Stadion during half-time. The day’s intensive security operation had met its first visible challenge at 2pm when a crowd of pro-Palestine protesters, cohered by the Palestine Committee in  , gathered at Spikersuppa in central Oslo in preparation for their march to Ullevaal. Yards away, polite applause had rippled as the swearing-in of Norway’s parliament was relayed on a big screen. The marchers, whose number swelled to around 1,500 during the 2.6 mile route, were more vigorously propelled by flares and beating drums. Red cards were distributed among attendees. Inger Lise, wearing a national team scarf, was one of few who had turned up to the protest in Norway’s football colours. Once a keen player, she had a match ticket but considered the occasion tainted. “It’s very frustrating,” she said while holding one end of a large “Free Palestine” banner, the other clasped by a friend. “The game shouldn’t have been played but it’s not up to us to ruin it. It’s just horrible that we are here now.” Inside Andy’s Pub, a Liverpool-themed bar near the meeting point, six supporters in their mid-50s felt the moment they could make an impact had passed. “Israel should have been banned before, we can’t do anything now,” one said. They had travelled from Tromso, inside the Arctic Circle, and wore shirts carrying names from the 1998 squad. As the march passed northwards, some residents gathered on balconies or wound down car windows to shout encouragement. The police presence, visible but never overbearing, stopped well short of confrontation at that point. The only exception came as participants prepared to depart. A handful of Israeli journalists had arrived at the protest and, apparently after being involved in an exchange with a member of the public, were escorted from the scene. The 80-minute march ended with speeches and songs at a stage opposite Ullevaal, a smaller protest arriving to swell numbers in the hour before kick-off. Nearby, a few fans bearing both Norwegian and Israeli flags were marshalled towards the ground by police officers. As the teams emerged before kick-off, supporters in the west stand unfurled a Palestine flag alongside another imploring “Let children live”. The sight will not have been lost on Fifa and Uefa. Israel’s pocket of around 100 visitors raised their own flag during the national anthem while a minority of home supporters whistled. Temperatures inside the stadium rose no higher. The only notable security lapse arose in the eighth minute when, even though the front three rows were covered, a sole protester ran on to the pitch before being wrestled to the ground by security personnel. He was named by local media as Mario Ferri, who refers to himself as “The Falcon” and has a history of such incursions in various global stadiums. By then Haaland had already erred from the spot, Daniel Peretz saving his first effort and a VAR-ordered retake. After play resumed Norway pulled clear against opponents let down by a nonexistent defence. Haaland made amends in between own goals by Anan Khalaili and Idan Nachmias, the latter ending up in hospital after colliding with a post. Three goals in a 10-minute spell had ended the contest. As the first half ended, around 200 protesters remained outside. In the day’s sole flashpoint, police used teargas after a barrier was pulled down near the stadium entrance. Ten arrests were made but the authorities emphasised most involved had behaved well. Haaland put himself front and centre again by finishing twice more, his third bringing up 51 in 46 caps. “Free Palestine” chanted a section of the support as proceedings wound down, reminding everyone else that the backdrop could never quite be punctured. “I didn’t feel anything extreme,” said Ben Shimon of the atmosphere. He took pains to laud Norway’s hospitality, while lamenting that of his players, and hoped a weight will lift now peace no longer looks a pipedream. “We have a big role in Israeli society, we have to stay together. I believe the national team of Israel, and other national teams, have a bigger perspective than football.” The day’s events had proved it.", "tags": ["world", "cup", "2026", "qualifiers", "world", "cup", "norway", "israel", "match", "reports"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/11/nat-sciver-brunt-shines-as-england-recover-to-sweep-aside-sri-lanka", "content": "A patient hundred from the captain, Nat Sciver-Brunt, saved England from embarrassment against Sri Lanka in Colombo, enabling them to recover from 168 for six and win by 89 runs. Sciver-Brunt was dropped on three by Udeshika Prabodhani at midwicket and went on to score a run-a-ball 117, before finally being caught at long-on off the penultimate ball of the innings. Tammy Beaumont’s 32 was the next highest contribution. Sciver-Brunt’s rescue effort enabled England to regain their spot at the top of the World Cup standings, and means she has now surpassed coach Charlotte Edwards’s record for most hundreds scored at 50-over World Cups: this was her fifth. It is also the first since her wife, Katherine Sciver-Brunt, gave birth to their son, Theo, in March, and featured the memorable sight of the England captain lofting a six over deep extra cover to bring up the milestone, then cradling her bat like a baby while looking up to Katherine and Theo in the stands in celebration. “That one was for Theo,” Sciver-Brunt said. “They’ve come out to Sri Lanka to watch me, so I thought I’d give back to them for supporting me. “It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster in terms of missing them, but I got a bit more sleep when they were at home. Katherine had to take the flight on alone with Theo, which was a lot for her to commit to, so I’m glad I made it worth her while.” Sri Lanka started positively with the bat, reaching 95 for one after 20 overs, but an extraordinary 10-over spell from Sophie Ecclestone, which included three maidens, put a wrecking ball through their chase. Hasini Perera and Harshitha Samarawickrama were caught trying to hit out, while Kavisha Dilhari was bowled by Ecclestone attempting a slog sweep. The key breakthrough came in the 29th over, when the captain, Chamari Athapaththu – returning after being stretchered off in the sixth over with cramp – was deceived by Ecclestone’s flight and bowled through the gate. “Sri Lanka had built a partnership. I wanted [Ecclestone] to come on and steady the ship, not necessarily take wickets, but she did that as a bonus,” Sciver-Brunt said. “Her clarity in what she wants to do is brilliant. She makes it look very simple.” Sciver-Brunt followed up her match-defining innings with a couple of scalps of her own, while Charlie Dean tossed up a beauty to Vishmi Gunaratne and held on to an excellent diving catch at midwicket to dismiss Dewmi Vihanga, as Sri Lanka collapsed to 164 all out in 45.4 overs. Sign up to  Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action after newsletter promotion On the eve of this match England had talked about having to “earn runs” in the subcontinent, but – Sciver-Brunt aside – their batters failed to display the patience required in tropical Sri Lankan conditions. First, Beaumont stitched up Amy Jones by haring off for a nonexistent single after hitting the ball straight to Dilhari at cover, leaving Jones short of her ground running to the striker’s end. Then the left-arm spinner Inoka Ranaweera took three for 33, including removing Emma Lamb and Alice Capsey in the space of five balls in the 35th over. The 39-year-old Ranaweera, now into her 13th year of international cricket, has already proved that age really is just a number at this tournament, finishing with four wickets against India – including three in the same over. She was just as dangerous against England’s right-handers, getting plenty of turn and dip to bowl Lamb behind her legs, and having Capsey stumped after sliding her back foot just out of the crease. As so often, the England captain played a lone hand, in an innings which was without extravagance until its final stages. She ground out runs – 52 of her 117 came in singles – but came alive in the last four overs of the innings, striking six boundaries and enabling England to add 44 more to their total.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/11/northampton-leicester-prem-rugby-union-match-report", "content": "Northampton have gone all Euro and on Saturday the dividends rolled in. Not for the first time this season Anthony Belleau and Edoardo Todaro, French and Italian, had the run of the place, scoring two and one tries respectively, as   went to the top of the table, albeit temporarily, dispatching their nearest and dearest. Theirs has been a bitter-sweet opening to the season, squandering huge leads in games one and two, but here they timed their surges to perfection to come away with the win and their third bonus point out of three.   held the lead for large stretches of a match that only really hit its straps in the second half, but by then we had not only tries in a seesawing contest, but the customary argy-bargy. Belleau’s second try, on the hour, clinched it. “It’s not often French internationals become available, who are willing to leave France, for financial reasons,” said the Northampton director of rugby, Phil Dowson. “The market’s slightly different over there. For somebody who wanted to push his boundaries, not from a financial point of view, but from a rugby-development one, is very refreshing.” Belleau, a fly-half, came on early in the second half at full-back, replacing Tommy Freeman, who was playing his first match of the season, his 100th for Northampton. Freeman, in turn, had moved across to cover full-back when George Hendy limped off. Lower-leg injuries were the order of the first half. Luke Pearce, the referee, was off within 10 minutes with a calf problem. Hendy followed 15 minutes later, having landed awkwardly under a high ball, which stretched Northampton’s resources out wide, already missing at least three potential starters. A few minutes before the break, Freeman seemed to break down under a high ball, as if shot. He limped on until half-time, witnessing Northampton’s third try, scored down the other wing. Finn Russell led   to a bonus-point 38-17 victory over   on his return to the team despite picking up a yellow card that caused a brief second-half wobble. After his watching brief in the coaches' box last weekend, the British and Irish Lions fly-half (pictured meeting fans) returned as captain and displayed his full range of skills in his team's third successive Prem victory to top the table overnight, at least. Russell's faultless kicking supplied 13 points for Bath, who scored first-half tries through Tom de Glanville, Tom Dunn, Ollie Lawrence and Ewan Richards. Gloucester, who have now lost seven matches on the bounce in all competitions against their West Country rivals, crossed three times through Will Joseph, Ollie Thorley and Ben Loader – the last two coming early in the second half when Russell was off the field to close to 28-17. But Russell returned to kick his sole penalty of the contest before converting Richards' second try of the contest. Johann van Graan, Bath's head of rugby, said: \"Defensively Finn was excellent  and his kicking game is so good that you've just got to expect that of him. He's been away from rugby for 10 weeks, on holiday and then he had to regain his fitness, and he comes and delivers that for 78 minutes.\"  overcame a 20-minute red card for Scotland international Tom Jordan to record a hard-fought 18-14 victory over   at Ashton Gate. Jordan was dismissed for a high challenge and their already depleted side were further hit by failed head injury assessments for Josh Carrington and Jack Bates. However, they still triumphed with tries from Bill Mata and Gabriel Oghre, while Sam Worsley kicked a penalty and a conversion, with Jordan adding a penalty. Ben Hammersley and Henry Slade scored Exeter's tries, with Slade adding the extras. Rob Baxter, Exeter's director or rugby, was frustrated after seeing his side fail to take advantage of Bristol's tribulations: \"Going out in the second half, we needed to take the game by the scruff of the neck and take charge.

This time they were more circumspect in the opening exchanges. Theirs was the first try, two more returning Lions, Alex Mitchell and Fin Smith, combining, the former’s chip ahead bouncing wickedly into his hands to set up the latter for a run to the posts. But Leicester were if anything more direct. Billy Searle had opened the scoring with a penalty in the second minute, before Freddie Steward started and finished a fine score at the end of the first quarter. Northampton upped the pace in the 10 minutes to half-time. Todaro, the teenage Italian winger, finished on the right after Tom Litchfield and Freeman had combined down the left to put Saints back in front. When Searle retook the lead for the visitors with a penalty two minutes before the break, Todaro broke down the left and sent Tom Pearson into the corner for Saints’ third and a 17-13 lead. Freeman returned for the start of the second half, but it took one missed tackle to convince him he could not carry on. On came Belleau, and the complexion of the game changed again. First, though, Leicester retook the lead when Harry Wells was driven over after a series of penalties to the corner. Five minutes later, Belleau struck with his first.

The Robins began the campaign as rugby league’s great bridesmaids. Without a major trophy in 40 years and with a litany of failures at the final hurdle, you wondered whether this talented group of players could ever shake off the tag of nearly men. That moment finally arrived earlier this summer when KR won the Challenge Cup but the one they really wanted was a first league title since 1985. Freed of the pressures of the past at last, Willie Peters and his side underlined in no uncertain terms on the biggest stage why Rovers are now Super League’s premier side. It is not an exaggeration to say that the Robins did to Wigan what Wigan have become accustomed to doing to opposition sides throughout their own era of dominance. After a nervy start, Rovers were far superior in almost every aspect and once they went ahead, they never looked like surrendering that advantage. Against a team as good as Wigan, that is about as high a compliment as you can pay them. The contest had already been decided by the time Burgess seared away in the closing minutes. Peters, the man who has masterminded this remarkable turnaround to drag a club who were bottom of the Super League as recently as 2020 to the treble, hugged almost every member of staff he could lay his hands on. The Rovers substitutes fell to their knees and the 20,000-plus KR fans, many of whom could have never imagined one trophy, let alone three, were sent into delirium. They are only the fifth club to win the Grand Final, with Leeds the last team to win it for the first time in 2004. There can be no complaints about the outcome, with Rovers sensational when it mattered most: producing the kind of display Wigan have done in the biggest games in recent years. “There’s only been four teams who’ve won the treble and nobody has won the treble twice, which tells you how hard it is,” Peters said. “They have been absolutely amazing.” The contest could and perhaps should have taken a very different outlook in the first half, but for some rare profligacy from Wigan as opportunities for Liam Farrell and Bevan French came and went. There was a fair argument to say it should have been 12-0 to Wigan and with their record in finals that would have been commanding. The game swung on a pivotal moment as Wigan’s Brad O’Neill was sent to the sin-bin after a dangerous tackle on Tyrone May. Within two minutes, Hull KR went ahead as the outstanding Mikey Lewis cut through to score between the posts. With O’Neill still off the field the Robins went further in front as a fine passage of play led to the former Wigan winger Burgess touching down. Sign up to  The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion Rhyse Martin missed the conversion but suddenly, the reigning champions were scrambling. A penalty from Adam Keighran on the stroke of half-time got Wigan on the board and when Harry Smith scored shortly after the restart, a comeback appeared to be on the cards. But Hull KR quelled it as a penalty from Martin nudged their lead back out to six points. They then scored the decisive try as Jez Litten finished a fine move to leave Wigan behind by 12 and, quite frankly, shellshocked. This was an off-colour night from them, and they could have no complaints about the outcome, a point their head coach, Matt Peel, made post-match. “It’s tempting to look back on things we wish we’d done differently,” Peet said. “We didn’t do what we’d love to do but you’ve got to credit Hull KR for their energy in those periods. Full credit to them.” Wigan were bidding to secure a third successive Super League crown but this never felt like it would be their night – especially when it was revealed after the game that Hull KR’s hooker, Michael McIlorum, played through the pain with a fractured ankle. Burgess’ try with three minutes left merely confirmed what everyone had started to expect over the course of the evening: there is a new force in Super League at long last.", "tags": ["super", "league", "rugby", "league", "hull", "kr", "wigan", "warriors", "match", "reports"]},

The Slovenian crossed the line first in Bergamo after a trademark attack on the Passo di Ganda climb to blitz the rest of the field and become the first man since Eddy Merckx in 1975 to win three Monuments, the Tour de France and a world title in a single season. From the moment Pogacar was set up to launch his attack by his UAE teammates with around 38km remaining of the 241km race, there was no doubt of the final result, with only Quinn Simmons out on his own 1min 10sec up the road. Pogacar finished nearly two minutes ahead of Remco Evenepoel, who again ended up second behind cycling’s dominant force as he did at the recent world and European championships. Australian   finished third, rounding out the podium. “To win five times in a row … every time I start it feels like this race is suited to me, but also at the same time that with such a good team around me we can pull it off,” Pogacar said. “I always say, seven years in a row, this is my best season, and again I can say this is the best season so far.” At 27 years old Pogacar has now won 10 of the sport’s Monuments – the five toughest and longest one-day races of the year – nine shy of a career tally set by Merckx, who won three in 1969, 1971, 1972 and 1975. His fifth straight victory in the “Race of the Falling Leaves” is another record to add to a growing list as Italian great Coppi achieved four consecutive wins between 1946 and 1949, with his fifth coming in 1954. Pogacar is used to making history as this year he became the first man to win the Tour de France and world championship two seasons in a row. He is now also the first to finish on the podium of all five Monuments in the same season. In April, Pogacar   and  , victories which go alongside third place in Milan-San Remo and second in Paris-Roubaix which were both  . Backed by a star-studded team which included the likes of Isaac del Toro and Adam Yates, Pogacar plugged away in the peloton for much of the race as a breakaway containing Simmons pushed ahead early on.

Pogacar finally made his move on that climb, exactly as he did two years ago, once the peloton crumbled in the face of the punishing pace set by his teammate Jay Vine with Del Toro holding off the competition. From there Pogacar slashed at Simmons’ lead and caught him some way before the summit, and from there it was a one-man procession to a historic win. Storer became only the second Australian rider in 120 years to make the podium at the Tour of Lombardy, after Phil Anderson in 1986. The 28-year-old had tried to go with Evenepoel after they had both been left for dead by Pogacar, but he was distanced by the Belgian over the final 10km and battled home for third, 25 seconds clear of Simmons. It was Storer’s maiden monument podium in a year when he also earned his first stage victory at Paris-Nice, followed by both a stage win and the overall triumph in Tour of the Alps.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/12/melbourne-swimming-club-propulsion-broadmeadows-aquatic-centre-diversity", "content": "t is 6am on a crisp Friday morning at Broadmeadows aquatic centre in Melbourne’s north-west, and members of the Western Melbourne Propulsion Swim Club are doing laps under the watchful eye of their coach. It is a scene repeated every morning at pools across Australia. But at Broadmeadows, something is different. The composition of many of Australia’s favourite sports have come to reflect the multicultural makeup of this country, even if racism and discrimination persist. The latest Socceroos squad, for example, features players with heritage from 15 countries, from Bosnia to Burundi. While basketball, athletics and AFL have long sought to engage with African-Australian communities. But swimming – despite its popularity and leading coverage every four years at the Olympics – has trailed behind in providing pathways for Australians from culturally diverse backgrounds. Historically there have been very few high-profile Australian swimmers from migrant communities. Although, a number of Asian-Australian swimmers have excelled in recent years – Chinese-Australian William Yang, Korean-Australian Se-Bom Lee and Brunei-born Joshua Yong all competed in Paris. There are no easy answers to swimming’s diversity challenge, and the underlying causes are manifold: accessibility, cost, a lack of role models, discrimination, cultural expectations, the sport’s varied global status. But in Melbourne, Propulsion club’s efforts to drive change are beginning to bear fruit. “We have a two-pronged approach: it’s high performance but community-focused,” says Luka Zubcic, who has led the club for the past seven seasons and recently stepped down as president. “Having people from a wealth of backgrounds, a wealth of experiences, bringing all of the different viewpoints and motivations that they have – it really goes to the community-focused piece.” For Zubcic, 28, the inaccessibility of the sport for many potential swim hopefuls is something he knows all too well. Growing up in the north-west suburbs, Zubcic trained locally until he reached a level where he needed to change clubs. That necessitated a lengthy commute; he later joined Propulsion as a swimmer, after growing tired of the hours in transit. “The traditional model was that you would commute into inner Melbourne, to the other side of town,” he says. “But that commute takes a toll.” Propulsion attracts swimmers from a number of local government areas: Hume, Melton, Brimbank, Maribyrnong, Merri-bek and Moonee Valley – areas with a high proportion of first- and second-generation Australians. “It’s special to be able to offer that in these swimmers’ back yard,” Zubcic says. Accessibility matters in swimming more than most sports – you can’t practise technique in the back yard. Access to 50-metre pools is limited, and competition for lanes can be fierce. Zubcic bemoans that his club does not “own our own water” – unlike some swim clubs. Jonathan Qariaqus is one beneficiary of Propulsion’s location. The 18-year-old, who swims breaststroke and backstroke, was born in Australia to parents from Iraq. Qariaqus has recently started university, commuting an hour to campus, and says it would not be possible to keep up his swimming if the pool was not nearby. “It’s not too far, it’s not a hassle,” he says. Swimming is not popular among his fellow Iraqi-Australians. “I know from Iraq, there weren’t many pools – so we’re more into soccer,” he says. “When people from Iraq come here, and you say swimming, they think it’s a joke.” And these community perceptions carry weight. “Maybe they don’t view professional swimming as something you should aim for,” Qariaqus says.” This is one cause of the lack of diversity in elite swimming, Zubcic says, while for white Australians, swimming is seen as “an acceptable avenue to pursue”. For communities that may not have the same social affinity with the pool, the intense time commitment at a young age can be a major barrier. “If you want to be very good, it’s a huge commitment – to the extent that it takes away from other things in your life,” Zubcic says. “Foremost in my mind is something like school. Depending on the community you’re involved in, your education can be sacrosanct.” Sign up to  Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion Propulsion has tried to keep swimmers attached to the program, even if they decrease their training load, in the hope they resume once schooling pressures end. “We help them through those transitional years,” Zubcic says. “That takes patience – it might be there are a few years where they are only coming in a handful of times a week, but when they’re ready, we’re ready to take them on that next step.” Another swimmer in the Broadmeadows pool is 14-year-old Zara Gamboa. The Filipino-Australian is on a high, having recently won a medal at the age short course national championships. Watching on is her father, Marc Gamboa. “Some of the barriers happen as early as [junior] swimming,” he says. “If you don’t give them the opportunity from the start, they won’t reach the top.” Gamboa sees those barriers in the Filipino-Australian community. “I know some families who have quit [the sport] because they want their kids to be a doctor,” he says, laughing. “Zara will pursue what she wants.” Cost is another significant factor. Major swim programs are often attached to private schools, while standalone clubs can be expensive for parents. Traditionally, the expense involved has meant swimmers came from middle-class backgrounds. “You have to have a program that is economically viable,” Zubcic says. “But [it can’t be] cost-prohibitive.” At Broadmeadows, Qariaqus hopes to lead by example, following other members of the club including Johann Stickland, who represented Samoa at the 2024 Olympics, and rising Australian-Egyptian star Ahmed Elgammal. Asked what his future holds, Qariaqus gives a familiar answer: “I’ll see where I can take it. The Olympics – maybe one day!” For Zubcic, the benefits of their approach are clear in and out of the water. Propulsion is one of the fastest growing clubs in Melbourne – when Zubcic joined seven years ago, it had just 50 swimmers – today it has more than 250. In time, programs like this might ensure that the national team, the Dolphins, more fully reflect the cultural diversity of modern Australia. “I do think about how diverse our club is, Zara Gamboa says, “compared to say the Australian team.” If Zara reaches the top level, she is eligible to represent the Philippines, New Zealand or Australia. But her father says it will be an easy answer for his daughter: “This is our home.”", "tags": ["swimming", "australia", "sport", "features"]},

It has been a unique journey for the site where Fort Lauderdale’s Lockhart Stadium once stood. “Even after all these years it’s so funny to me that Lionel Messi, one of the most famous faces in the history of mankind, is not only playing for our club but playing in this stadium that was abandoned,” said Nico Abad, a member of The Siege supporters’ group and a native of Broward County, where Chase Stadium stands on the former site of Lockhart. “It’s where kids would go to do doughnuts and to smoke and drink.” The former home of the defunct Fort Lauderdale Strikers and erstwhile MLS side Miami Fusion was demolished by the newly established Inter Miami in 2019 and rejuvenated almost as a last resort, after years of   in Miami itself threatened the club’s ability to even exist. Founding owner David Beckham’s consolation prize north of Vice City would ultimately become a once-in-a-generation experience for the area’s soccer fans, drawing the eyes of the world. That era is almost over. On Saturday, Chase Stadium will host its final MLS regular season game when   play Atlanta. After the playoffs, it’ll have served its purpose. The time has come for Inter Miami to play in Miami proper. Next season, the club moves into the purpose-built home in   Freedom Park, a 25,000-capacity arena forming the centrepiece of a “soccer village” with shopping, restaurants, office space, and a lush park next to the city’s international airport. It’ll be quite a contrast from the stopgap in Broward County, amid a blue-collar heart of auto repair shops beside an airfield. While in a sense this is a reward for Miami-based supporters who may well have spent far longer in traffic to Chase Stadium than watching football there, there’s genuine affection among fans for their intimate temporary home. There are legitimate reasons why Chase Stadium works. The fans are close to the pitch. There are high school-like, open air bleachers behind the goal, where the most vocal and ardent fans gather and are fully exposed to south Florida’s unpredictable summer weather. It’s like coming to watch a lower division club, until you turn to the field to see Messi, Sergio Busquets, Rodrigo De Paul, Jordi Alba and Luis Suárez. Beckham too. “[It] has grown on me in its mediocrity,” said Abad. “After 150 games there, you do end up having a crush on it. I won’t miss the sauna porta potties. I’m looking forward to air-conditioned bathrooms.” Many fans recounted those spellbinding early Messi games as their finest football memories. There was the near disbelief of the Argentinian’s July 2023 unveiling in tropical rains dubbed “Hurricane Messi” and then the   on his debut in the Leagues Cup against Cruz Azul – a tournament he would lead them to win. The stadium has also brought down the curtain on legendary careers. Gonzalo Higuaín retired a Heron. Busquets and Jordi Alba   at the end of this campaign. Suarez is 38 and his contract expires this season. “The experience is special because it feels like a small club right now,” said Miami-based season-ticket holder Paul Zamek. “When Suárez or Busquets score, they run to their families. We’re so close you can see the emotion. I’ll miss that intimacy.” Zamek’s fellow season-ticket holder Mason Harris added: “This is where I got to bond with my kids and watch them show interest in the sport. They didn’t before, so this stadium will always have that for me.” Lockhart Stadium was originally built in 1959 for high school track and field meets, but professional greats graced it too. Gerd Müller, George Best and Gordon Banks turned out for the Strikers in the late 1970s. Pelé scored there for the New York Cosmos in 1977, and was reacquainted with Banks after   in the 1970 World Cup. Now, after an up-and-down season under Javier Mascherano, today’s great hero, Messi, has the chance to give the Chase Stadium era the perfect send-off. If Inter Miami reach   Cup and face a lower-ranked team, the game would be played in Fort Lauderdale. It’s why the team aren’t leaning too much into Saturday. They are hosting their annual fan appreciation night and saying, ‘we’ll see you in the playoffs.’ A win against Atlanta could seal homefield advantage for a final run in Broward County. Fort Lauderdale may not be a bustling hub like Miami itself, but it’s accessible to all three of south Florida’s counties – Broward, Palm Beach to the north and Miami-Dade to the south. Sign up to  Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer after newsletter promotion Inter Miami say match-goers are predominantly Miami-Dade based, but for others following the team will become more difficult. Broward and Palm Beach fans formed the bedrock during the leaner pre-Messi years. Naturally, Inter Miami want to retain them. The road traffic is the road traffic, but the club says the 2.5 miles of new roadways serving Miami Freedom Park will be among the most extensive for a new US stadium in decades. The club says the 5,000 new parking spaces will be the most at an MLS stadium. Communal transport may be slightly easier than it is now. Across the street at the airport is the Tri-Rail station, serving all south Florida, and the localised Metro-Rail and Miami Mover options. Tri-Rail offers affordable trains through Broward and into Palm Beach via 17 stops, but timetable adjustments would be needed to fully support games. The club may yet renew an agreement with the high-speed train company Brightline to bus supporters in from the downtown Miami hub. However, the current lack of clarity is leaving some fans feeling left out of the conversation. “The club have given us the cold shoulder about everything regarding Miami Freedom Park,” says Abad, who lives between Chase Stadium and Miami Freedom Park. “They’ve asked for zero input. The liaisons between the club and the supporters’ groups have not interacted with us at all in that capacity.” “My friends who support New York City FC have been included in every aspect of the new stadium build, including where the supporter groups are going to be seated. Their club looks for opinions and advice. Meanwhile, these guys can’t even tell us if they’re going to have a transport agreement with Brightline or the Tri-Rail.” Inter Miami aren’t waving goodbye to Broward County entirely. The stadium will continue to host major events. The training ground, club HQ, and youth academy will remain within the complex. Beckham has pledged to create a women’s team under the club’s banner, which could bring a new and lasting footballing legacy to the stadium. And while the memories of this era are fond, most fans we spoke to are enthused by the move. “Get me into a proper bowl already. I think everyone’s going to love it,” said Abad. Attendance has sagged a little now everyone who wanted to see Messi has done so. Reported figures remain high, but the naked eye tells a different story. There are plenty of empty seats. Primary market tickets are still available in almost every section for Saturday’s game. “Fort Lauderdale is a great city, but there’s a different energy in Miami,” Zamek adds. “This is a Miami team, it belongs in Miami.”", "tags": ["inter", "miami", "mls", "lionel", "messi", "us", "sports", "miami", "florida", "features"]},

With the scores tied at 1-1 and the bases loaded with two outs in the bottom of the 11th inning, the Dodgers’ Andy Pages hit a routine grounder to Kerkering. But the 24-year-old fumbled the ball and, instead of going to first for an easy out, he threw it wide of catcher JT Realmuto at home plate as Hyeseong Kim scored the winning run. “[The ball] just hit off my foot,” Kerkering said. “Once the pressure got to me, I just thought there’s a little faster throw to JT, little quicker throw than trying to cross-body it to Bryce [Harper at first].” A WALK-OFF TO MOVE ON TO THE NLCS.

Enner Valencia, the 35-year-old journeyman and the nation’s all-time scorer, sealed the win with a penalty in his 100th appearance. The Estadio Monumental roared with ecstasy and emotion. Both sides had already sealed qualification for 2026 and the visitors were playing without Lionel Messi, who had also said goodbye to qualifiers after his final game in Buenos Aires a few days prior. But none of these narratives mattered to Ecuadorian fans. They were acknowledging a magnificent campaign as   ended second in the table, their best-ever finish since Conmebol qualifiers moved to a single table. And this despite starting the campaign with a three-point penalty due to the use of documents with false information to register Byron Castillo in the previous cycle. It was a campaign of total resiliency; Ecuador have also not lost a game since 6 September 2024, a tight 1-0 loss away at Brazil. In that timeframe, they have also only conceded one goal, with just five conceded over the whole of qualifying. Ecuador’s trajectory may be surprising to some, but it’s really a natural extension of the growth of the domestic game, an increase of players playing their trade in Europe, and a youth system that continues to produce stars. This is a national team that could make a run in next summer’s World Cup. Now, as they prepare for two friendlies against two hosts – the United States and Mexico – the aim and message from Ecuador’s standpoint is simple: keep going. “The challenge is to play these friendlies with the same level of intensity as official matches,” said head coach Sebastián Beccacece last week. “Both the US and México are very strong national teams and we want to beat them.” Beccacece, and Argentinian, became Ecuador’s head coach in August of 2024, replacing Félix Sánchez after losing to Argentina in Copa América quarter-final. At 44, he’s a fairly young manager, and has never been an international one. He has no history as a professional player either. In Ecuador, he took one one of the most coveted jobs in South American soccer, with a talented and hungry squad featuring Chelsea’s Moisés Caicedo and PSG center back Willian Pacho. Yet despite this supposed mismatch, Beccacece has instilled defensive discipline into a team that are now masters of the counterattack thanks to an abundance of poise and pace. Under Beccacece, the low block is their friend, especially when protecting a lead and to them, defense – like the saying goes – really does win championships. Due to this philosophy, there are some corners of Ecuador’s media that criticize the lack of offensive creativity. Out of the South American teams who qualified for the World Cup, Ecuador were the joint lowest scorers alongside Paraguay. But to the team, their stingy defensive unit is a symbol of pride. . “We don’t play with a back five,” said Àngelo Preciado, an important member of the squad, when asked on Ecuador’s popular show Marca 90 about the need to play with such a congested line. “I’m a big winger [first] but I try to help the defenders. Maybe it’s seen as a defensive thing but we play a different kind of role.” The role Preciado alluded to is a collective responsibility to to protect the goalkeeper and ensure no one enters the box. This team has turned stubbornness into an art form. lack of history as a player means he has worked his way up through the coaching ladder, eventually working very closely with Jorge Sampaoli as his assistant for Universidad de Chile where they won practically every domestic title and the Copa Sudamericana in 2011. Eventually it led the pair to the national team during Chile’s golden years, which included the World Cup in 2014 when  . They were also the duo that   a year later. Afterward, he joined Argentinian club Defensa y Justicia before Sampaoli approached him once again, this time as part of the 2018 World Cup campaign for Argentina. Now he leads a national team that has grown in stature due to the continuous investment in domestic youth development and global awareness. Clubs such as Independiente del Valle and Liga de Quito have implemented such strong projects from the youth level that the country is now seen as a hub for European scouts –  . From the aforementioned Pacho to Piero Hincapié, the versatile defender who was part of Bayer Leverkusen’s historic Bundesliga title in 2023/24 and now plays for Arsenal. Every position, though, has up and coming stars. Independiente del Valle, for example, has one of the best academies in the continent and continues to produce talent such as the aforementioned Caicedo, Preciado, Pacho and Joel Ordóńez from Club Brugge. Then there are younger players such as 18-year-old Kendry Páez (on loan at Strasbourg from Chelsea) and 22-year-old Patrik Mercado. These clubs are now focusing so much more on infrastructure – analytically and technically – than ever before. For these upcoming friendlies against the USMNT and México, Ecuador won’t have Caicedo, Hincapié and Flamengo’s Gonzalo Plata in order to give them recovery time for their respective clubs as some are dealing with injuries. But it’s still a valuable chance for other members to prove why they deserve a place in next summer’s tournament. Regardless of the availability, Beccacece doesn’t care so much if these are just friendlies or not. In last week’s press conference, he ended it with a call to action and a warning to anyone who might underestimate his team. “We are focused on making the greatest World Cup in the history of the national team,” he said.", "tags": ["world", "cup", "2026", "us", "sports", "ecuador", "usa", "world", "cup", "features"]},

They are up into mid-table and if a 2-0 victory over Feyenoord in the Europa League will not quite live in the memory in the way last season’s games against  ,   and   do, a return to Rotterdam at least evoked the glory days of 1982. It will be a while yet before the frustration at missing out on the Champions League fades, but there does now seem to be a gathering recognition that Villa have a decent chance of winning the Europa League, potentially adding Istanbul’s Besiktas Park to De Kuip as a venue where they have won a European trophy. The question, then, is where the gloom came from. Why did  about a squad that, at least in terms of those on permanent contracts, had essentially traded Jacob Ramsey and Leon Bailey for the promising Evann Guessand? How did Villa manage to talk themselves into such a funk that they did not win any of their first six games of the season? The answer to which, just as it was for Newcastle, who also began the season in apparent denial about the quality of the squad, is   rules (PSR). My Guardian colleague Barney Ronay has a theory that  , so that infuriated crowds could abuse the beleaguered figure on the touchline rather than a club’s board. The European Union used to perform a similar function for the UK government. It is useful for those in power to have something to blame, and in football that role is now performed by PSR. PSR is far from perfect. It has, surely without meaning to, created an environment in which clubs are incentivised to sell homegrown talent and to maintain a constant churn of transaction to generate, thanks to the marvels of amortisation, the book profit that gives them PSR headroom. But there are two things to be said in its defence. First, that clubs voted on it. It was not imposed from above. It is not some annoying and unavoidable quirk of nature. Clubs chose it and agreed to it. There are regular meetings at which they could propose an alternative. And some sort of check on spending is necessary, and this is the one we have got. Imagine it did not exist. Imagine if huge private equity companies or the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates could spend what they wanted. Football is financially stratified enough as it is, but the potential distortion would be grotesque: the game would, purely and simply, be about who had the richest owner. Plus there would always be the threat of that owner withdrawing with potentially devastating consequences for the club – as happened on a much lower scale to Gretna in 2008 after their   fell ill and seemingly lost interest. It is often forgotten that when financial fair play rules were introduced in 2011, whatever their impact since, their purpose was to protect clubs from the sort of over-ambition that had pushed Leeds to the brink. In practice, that may be frustrating for rising clubs. PSR does favour those clubs with large fanbases who attract the most lucrative sponsorship deals and can have a noodle partner in every port. But equally Villa, having gone from the Championship to the Champions League in five years, cannot really claim to have been held back. And if your wages to turnover ratio is – as Villa’s was – 91%, you are overspending. But the reason Villa are not in the Champions League this season is not PSR; it is that their goalkeeper got an entirely needless red card at Old Trafford in the final game of last season and so   would have seen them finish above Newcastle in fifth. There will be those who moan about the goal ruled out by a referee who incorrectly blew for a foul and did not let play run, so the video assistant referee could not make him review the decision, but glitches are part of the game. Had the goalline cameras not been blocked off by players’ bodies in 2020, Sheffield United would have taken the lead against Villa in a  ; defeat there would have relegated them. Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Villa’s transfer activity has been curtailed less because of PSR than the fact they have spent two years signing players who have not worked out. Last month saw the   – who, like gazpacho, never seems quite as effective outside Seville. Of 10 permanent signings made last season, only Amadou Onana started more than 10 league games. In January Villa gambled on the loan signings of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio to get into the Champions League. That was probably a justifiable move and nearly worked, but the nature of a gamble is that there are consequences if it goes wrong. Had they not been signed, another January arrival, Donyell Malen, might have had more opportunity to prove himself; his   last weekend suggested he could yet have a significant role. Harvey Elliott and Jadon Sancho may not be quite at the level of Rashford and Asensio but both are intriguing loan options with points to prove. Elliott has shown evidence of great talent but appears not to be a fit for Arne Slot at Liverpool and, at 22, needs regular football. Sancho has lost his way since leaving Borussia Dortmund for Manchester United in 2021, but the basic ability is there if Unai Emery can resurrect it. If the clouds of largely self-induced despondency have cleared, if they have accepted there is no grand conspiracy against them and that PSR is not the monster it has been painted as, what can Villa realistically hope for? Three of their players, more than any other club, started   over Wales on Thursday. Aston Villa remain a very good side. They are unlikely to be in a title race but is there any reason they could not challenge Newcastle or Tottenham for fifth?

League MVP A’ja Wilson led the way once again, scoring 31 points and grabbing nine rebounds in a performance emblematic of her reign atop the sport. Though she shot just 7-of-21 from the field, Wilson made 17 of 19 free throws and controlled the game at both ends, earning her second finals MVP award in three years.  Game 1:   Game 2:   Game 3:   Game 4:  Chelsea Gray and Jackie Young added 18 points apiece, combining for seven of Las Vegas’s 12 three-pointers. Jewell Loyd chipped in 12 points, and Dana Evans added 10 off the bench as the Aces displayed the depth and precision that have defined their dominant run. The Aces seized control from the opening tip, shooting 55% in a 30–21 first quarter behind Wilson’s 12 points. The Mercury rotated three defenders on her – Alyssa Thomas, DeWanna Bonner and Kalani Brown – but none could contain her blend of footwork and strength. Las Vegas quickly found rhythm from beyond the arc in the second quarter. Evans hit back-to-back threes, followed by makes from Loyd and Gray, extending the lead to 42–23. By halftime, the Aces led 54–38, having made nine of their 17 three-point attempts while committing only one turnover. Phoenix’s frustration boiled over midway through the third quarter when coach Nate Tibbetts was ejected after arguing a foul call against Monique Akoa Makani. His exit seemed to deflate the Mercury’s brief surge, and Las Vegas carried a 76–62 advantage into the final period. Phoenix opened the fourth quarter on an 8–0 run to trim the deficit to six, but Gray responded with consecutive threes to halt the momentum. The Mercury never drew closer than eight points the rest of the way. Kahleah Copper was relentless, scoring a career playoff-high 30 points on 12-of-22 shooting before fouling out in the final minutes. Thomas notched another triple-double – 17 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists – but also had nine turnovers and visibly labored after injuring her right shoulder late in the first half. The Mercury were already without Satou Sabally, their leading postseason scorer, who was sidelined with a concussion suffered late in Game 3. Her absence forced Phoenix to reshuffle their frontcourt rotation, with Bonner starting in her place and Brown seeing rare minutes early. Despite their depleted roster, the Mercury’s resilience reflected a strong playoff run that included upsets of the defending champion New York Liberty and top-seeded Minnesota Lynx. The Aces’ victory capped a dominant stretch that saw them win 25 of their final 28 games after a 53-point loss to Minnesota in early August. Las Vegas became the first team since the Houston Comets’ four straight titles from 1997 to 2000 to win three championships in a four-year span.

The most important place to win – in fact, the   important place to win, according to him – is at the 2026 World Cup. The results would ideally match the performances, sure, but they don’t have to. Not yet. That’s a good thing, because once again on Friday night the US performance was met with a result that was probably less than the Americans deserved. A 1-1 draw with   in Austin, Texas saw the US control the flow of the game most of the time, winning most of the individual defensive battles and on occasion constructing some truly attractive moves forward against Ecuador’s disciplined defensive shell. Ecuador’s goal came on a relatively minor mistake in the first half, pounced upon and punished by seemingly ageless veteran Enner Valencia. The US equalizer, scored by Folarin Balogun in the 71st minute, came on one of those aforementioned moves that did not usually lead to dangerous scoring chances. The looks on the faces of US players after the final whistle betrayed a sense of disappointment; a feeling that they could have, should have gotten more against the team that finished second in a stacked South American qualifying process. In this game, as in a   to close the last window, the US utilized a three-man backline (Tim Ream, Chris Richards and Miles Robinson to start) with aggressive wingbacks and a double-pivot in midfield (Tanner Tessmann and Aidan Morris, both of whom made their returns to the national team after long absences). Once again, the US looked comfortable in that shape, settling into a rhythm after Ecuador’s press caused a few nervy moments in the game’s earliest stages. Tim Weah starting at right wingback provided an interesting wrinkle – Weah has most often played that role at club level, but has done so less often with the US. He looked right at home, providing nice balance to Max Arfsten on the opposite flank, with both overlapping at will on the occasions when the US was able to progress the ball into the middle third. Valencia nonetheless opened the scoring in the 31st minute with a run and finish that belied the mileage in the 35-year-old’s legs. In his 101st appearance for his national team, the former West Ham and Everton man found himself isolated in space against US defender Chris Richards. He used a well-weighted touch to open up space, forcing Richards to chase as he ran into the penalty area. With his window closing and US goalkeeper Matt Freese shaded to his near post, Valencia fired an inch-perfect finish past Richards’ feet and the hands of Freese to open the scoring. The US defending, particularly from the otherwise solid Richards, will be questioned in that moment. But so too should the team’s midfield, who were caught upfield as Jordy Alcivar received a pass out of the back and was able to turn easily and find Valencia with little resistance. Richards nearly made up for it just a few minutes later, latching on to a corner kick at the far post with a close-range effort on the ground that was saved by Ecuador goalkeeper Hernán Gilíndez – one of his five on the night. The US ended the first half with 66% of possession – a figure they maintained throughout – but very little to show for it thanks largely to unlucky moments, dogged defending from Ecuador, and a few cases of indecisive play. One such instance came in the 31st minute, the US were able to get numbers forward after turning over Ecuador in midfield. On the ball near the right touchline, Morris had four US bodies streaking into the box, each one an option for a potential cross. However, none of them came short to the ball, limiting Morris’ options. And when he did finally elect to hit Weah’s overlapping run, the pass was too heavy and rolled over the end line. The positives for the US, though, were numerous. Time and again, effective defending in space halted Ecuador’s counterattacks, including a particularly timely tackle from Miles Robinson in the 33rd minute that saved a potential 3-on-1 after a set piece. Sign up to  Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion And throughout, the US found spaces in Ecuador’s well-drilled structure. They simply could not make those spaces count, at least not until Balogun equalized. It was the second straight US appearance with a goal for Balogun, who seems to finally be grabbing hold of the team’s starting striker spot. His goal came off bad Ecuador turnover as they attempted to play out of the back, with Tessmann able to pick up the ball with space near the top of the box and hit a well-weighted through ball to Malik Tillman, who was barely kept onside by Ecuadorian defender Joel Ordóñez, jostling for position with Balogun near the penalty spot. Tillman’s cutback found Balogun’s foot, and his finish bounced off the post and into the back of the net. The goal ended a 520-minute shutout streak for Ecuador, an indicator of the defensive mindset that helped them to their best World Cup qualifying campaign ever, and that the issues the US faced were not unprecedented. There were further near-chances, opportunities that were blocked, passes that were a few inches off the mark. Christian Pulisic, held out of the starting lineup as a precaution after suffering a knock in training, was at the center of much of those positive moments after coming on as a sub.

World football’s governing body would like to outlaw the practice but will be guided by legal opinion in its first review of the relevant regulations for 11 years. A source involved in the process said Fifa was working towards making its rulebook more robust with a view to new regulations being ready early next year. This week   the “relevant Fifa regulatory framework” for its decision to allow Villarreal v Barcelona to take place in Miami in December and Milan v Como to go ahead in Perth in February. That is understood to have caused considerable irritation at Fifa because under existing regulations it is not their decision to make. The regulations were written in 2014, when domestic leagues moving matches to overseas territories was not regarded as a live issue after the   in 2008. The then Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore’s proposal for an “international round” was ahead of its time, but fans were outraged and it was not pursued elsewhere. Fifa can block what its rulebook refers to as an “international match” only if the correct processes are not followed. The rules state that such matches must be authorised by the football associations of the participating clubs and of the territory where a game is to be played and by the respective confederations. La Liga and Serie A gave their approval at the start of the season before passing the matter to Uefa, which provided its ruling this week. The issue now rests with the host FAs – the US Soccer Federation and Football Australia – and their respective confederations, Concacaf and the Asian Football Confederation. La Liga has scheduled Villarreal v Barcelona for Inter Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium but US Soccer’s approval is not guaranteed because there are concerns that Major League Soccer would suffer commercially if European and possibly Mexican league games could also be staged in the country. Fifa is working towards its regulations being more clearcut despite concerns over its legal position. The US-based promoter Relevent Sports brought an anti-trust lawsuit against US Soccer in 2019 after a request for Barcelona to play Girona in Miami was denied the previous year, with Fifa named as co-defendants.

Anti-terror measures are in place throughout Oslo; a no-fly zone will be implemented in the skies above Ullevaal Stadion and through all the tension it could be easy to forget that the national team are within touching distance of a first World Cup appearance for 27 years. Beating   would put them on the verge but the visitors’ presence has added multiple layers of complexity and controversy. That will be clear on Saturday afternoon, when a crowd of several thousand is expected to march peacefully from the centre of Oslo to a stage set up near the ground. It has been organised by the Palestine Committee in   under the slogan “Red card for Israel” and other bodies will be holding their own protests too. Outside Grønland metro station, posters of unclear provenance advertised a separate demonstration under the name “Stop the national match”. The authorities have been preparing for this occasion since the teams were drawn together more than a year ago. Israel are used to this: they are more than accustomed to the heightened environment around their matches and the enhanced level of security. “Not much higher than usual,” said their captain, Eli Dasa, which in practice is understood to mean 16 Mossad agents will be present. Nonetheless the added edge around this particular fixture has been inescapable. It was evident in the grilling, much of it hostile, dished out by Israeli journalists to the Norwegian Football Federation president, Lise Klaveness, on Friday afternoon. The NFF’s stance that Israel should be banned from international football, repeated publicly by Klaveness, has been made more stridently than that of any other European nation and it is one reason for a souring of relations. A decision to donate the proceeds from Saturday’s game to Doctors Without Borders’ work in Gaza also drew an affronted response from the Israeli Football Association, which felt a point was being made. Uefa was close to voting on a ban for Israel, which would not have applied to Fifa-run World Cup qualifiers without the global governing body following suit, after a United Nations commission concluded damningly that the state has committed genocide in Gaza. That idea was put on hold as Donald Trump’s peace plan gathered momentum last week. Klaveness repeated several times that she had not been the primary driving force behind those moves and reiterated, too, that the illegal presence of Israeli teams in occupied Palestinian territory is the reason for her position. “It’s not an effort to ban Israel [in particular], it’s about a rules-based system,” she said. “Like all people, we’re very happy there is a peace agreement. It’s more important than the game that the bombs stop and the hostages go home. When we’ve talked about sanctions it’s about breaches of Fifa law. That should be a continued discussion.” The NFF has never considered taking matters into their own hands and refusing to play Israel but campaigners such as Line Khateeb, who leads the Palestine Committee in Norway, believe this game should not be taking place. “Not at all,” she says. “Israel shouldn’t be included in an international football arena when they are violating international law and preventing Palestinian football players from playing. As long as Israel’s occupation withstands, Palestinians don’t have a chance to play football, to live, to learn or move freely. “We won’t disturb the game , we want Norway to win. We will protest, but after this game there will be other games involving youth teams or in European competitions. They should reject receiving Israel for Norwegian football teams.” The tension between taking a political or moral stance and cheering Norway towards a historic achievement has been further highlighted by the decision of Norsk Supporterallianse, a vocal presence on the domestic scene, to step back from any involvement in protests or statements around the Israel game. An Israel side that entertain going forward but repeatedly leak goals must win to retain any realistic chance of qualifying. There was an extraordinary scene in their pre-match press conference when their manager, Ran Ben Shimon, requested a pause and donned a kippah before reciting the bible passage Jeremiah 31:16. It was in tribute to the agreement that Hamas’s 20 living Israeli hostages must be released by 10am BST on Monday. Long-serving observers of the national team said it was the first time an Israel manager had made such a public intervention. This week’s events will be used as motivation. “It’s a lot of excitement, it helps us a lot,” said Dasa. “Since 7 October 2023 we haven’t attended a game with the feeling of hope that something will happen, but now they are on their way home and we would like to give them a nice present.” A small group of protesters was stationed outside Ullevaal while the Israel team trained on Friday night. Fewer than 200 Israel fans will be present to see the match. Norwegian supporters will be 3,000 fewer in number than normal, with small sections of the 28,000 capacity closed to prevent possible pitch incursions. That will be just one visual reminder, while proceedings unfold on the turf, of the context off it.", "tags": ["world", "cup", "2026", "qualifiers", "israel", "(football)", "norway", "israel", "(world", "news)", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "features"]},

Though he left the city just a few weeks ago, he could no longer recognise its streets. The buildings he had grown up in between had collapsed, their contents carpeting the roads in a mixture of torn furniture and broken concrete. Al-Kurdi could only recognise the Netzarim checkpoint marking his entry into north Gaza by the bodies lying at its feet – those who had tried to return home too early, their faces obscured by dust after being cut down by Israeli fire. “The city looks completely different, as if it is no longer the Gaza we once knew. In just a short time, massive destruction has spread everywhere. Almost all of the houses are destroyed, the streets blocked,” said al-Kurdi, a 40-year-old resident of Gaza City, as he returned to his home in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood. Al-Kurdi was one of the thousands of people of Gaza who took advantage of the   to travel back to their homes in northern Gaza. Videos showed a coastal highway clogged with crowds , many on foot, making their way northwards. For the first time since a previous ceasefire had collapsed in mid-March, fighting had stopped in Gaza. Hamas and Israel had agreed to stop fighting to prepare for the release of 48 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in an   that is meant to lead to a complete end to the two-year war.  \n  Like most people of north Gaza, al-Kurdi was filled with anxiety as he walked north. In the days leading up to the ceasefire, Israel had been intensely bombing Gaza City as part of its campaign to occupy the city. Al-Kurdi had no idea if his home was among the lucky few that was still standing. “I expect to find a ghost city. Some neighbours went ahead of me and told me the situation in the neighbourhood is catastrophic. They said my house was badly damaged by drone strikes, but is still standing,” he said. Even if his house was uninhabitable, he hoped to at least salvage some of his belongings. The journey north was not easy, as transportation was overwhelmed by the hundreds of thousands of people who wanted to return home. Those who headed north described walking for hours with Israeli drones flying overhead, and hearing explosions in the distance. “I slept in the street for two days waiting for permission to pass through the [Netzarim] checkpoint and return home. There were no vehicles available so I hung on to the back of my neighbour’s car for three hours until we arrived safely,” said Ahmad Salem, a 30-year-old from al-Jabalia in northern Gaza. Though a ceasefire was in effect, Israeli troops were still present in about half of the Gaza Strip. Approaching them could spell death, an Israeli military spokesperson said shortly after the ceasefire was announced, specifying specific areas that were still off limits. Despite her home town of Beit Lahia being one of the areas that the Israeli army said was still forbidden to enter, Asmaa Zuheir decided to make the journey back anyway. Even if she could not reach her home, she was hoping to at least catch a glimpse of her neighbourhood from afar. “I managed to reach the outskirts of Beit Lahia but could not move toward the centre because of the danger still present. Drones started firing at anyone who advanced toward the city,” said Zuheir, a 34-year-old nurse. From her vantage point on the outskirts of Beit Lahia, she could only see bare earth; the entire area had been flattened by bulldozers. “I saw no landmarks. The entire area had been levelled to the ground. There was not even rubble left from the houses,” said Zuheir. Zuheir did not dare stay too long, leaving as the crowds of people began to thin. Though she had not managed to reach her home, she began to walk back, stopping along the way to collect some tree branches to make a fire to keep warm once night fell. Salem had managed to reach his home, only to find that it no longer existed. He added his home to the long list of things he had lost over the last two years, unimportant compared to the loss of his brother. Still, despite losing his house, Salem still felt he had returned home. “Here in the north, despite all the devastation, I feel more at peace than in the south, because I am back where I belong, to my memories, my neighbourhood, my neighbours, and my home, even if it is destroyed,” he said. It is unclear how long the ceasefire in Gaza will last. The head of Hamas’s negotiating team, Khalil al-Hayya, said in a video address on Thursday that he had received guarantees from the US and other international powers that the ceasefire will hold. But negotiators still had to agree on thorny issues such as the disarmament of   and the makeup of a governing body for Gaza. Residents of Gaza had been here before – a ceasefire had ended in mid-March when Israel unilaterally decided to resume fighting – and so were eager to return home while they still could. Despite the destruction they found upon their return, many hoped that the days ahead held a respite from the brutality of the past two years. Amid the mounds of rubble, small scenes of joy still unfolded. “On the road, I saw someone returning. When he saw his house still standing from a distance, he began to run and shout with joy,” said Zuheir. “At that moment, I felt pain because I was returning to my area knowing my house was already completely destroyed.”  \n “People here, when they see any trace of their house, feel great hope and joy, as if it had never been damaged. All they want is a small piece of their memories from the house they once lived in,” she added.", "tags": ["israel-gaza", "war", "palestine", "israel", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "hamas", "gaza", "features"]},

Luis Castillo (1-0), making the first relief appearance of his major league career, pitched one and one-third innings for the victory, which put the Mariners in the AL Championship Series for the first time since 2001. Seattle will play the Blue Jays for the pennant in a matchup of 1977 expansion brethren. Game 1 is scheduled for Sunday in Toronto. JP Crawford led off the bottom of the 15th with a line-drive single to right off Tommy Kahnle (0-1). Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch before Cal Raleigh flied out, with Crawford taking third on a throwing error by center fielder Parker Meadows. After an intentional walk to Julio Rodriguez, Polanco singled on a 3-2 pitch to win it. Kerry Carpenter hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning to account for all of the Tigers’ offense. The Mariners tied it at 2-2 in the seventh on pinch hitter Leo Rivas’ RBI single. Both teams threatened repeatedly in extra innings, with the Mariners grounding into inning-ending double plays in both the 12th and 13th. Starters Tarik Skubal of Detroit and George Kirby of Seattle dueled in the early innings. Skubal, the favorite to win a second consecutive Cy Young Award, allowed one run on two hits and no walks over six innings with 13 strikeouts. He set an major league postseason record with seven consecutive strikeouts, fanning Victor Robles to end the second inning and striking out the side in both the third and fourth. The only run Skubal allowed came in the second. Josh Naylor lined a double the opposite way into the left field corner with one out, stole third and came home on Mitch Garver’s sacrifice fly to deep center. Skubal, who threw 99 pitches, retired the final 14 batters he faced before turning the ball over to the bullpen. The Mariners tied it in the seventh. Polanco drew a one-out walk off reliever Kyle Finnegan and Naylor grounded a two-out single into right, with Polanco stopping at second. After pinch hitter Dominic Canzone was announced, the Tigers turned to left-hander Tyler Holton. The Mariners countered with Rivas, who was celebrating his 28th birthday. Rivas lined a single to left to score Polanco and make it 2-2. Kirby opened with five scoreless innings before Javier Baez lined a leadoff double to center in the sixth. With the left-handed-hitting Carpenter coming to the plate, Mariners manager Dan Wilson opted to turn to Gabe Speier. That was in large part because Carpenter had five homers in his career against Kirby, including a two-run shot in the fifth inning of Game 1 – which the Tigers won 3-2 in 11 innings. Carpenter spoiled the strategy, hitting a 1-0 fastball right down the middle 411 feet into the stands in right-center field to give Detroit the lead. Kirby went five-plus innings and was charged with one run on three hits with no walks and six strikeouts.", "tags": ["mlb", "seattle", "mariners", "detroit", "tigers", "baseball", "us", "sports"]},

They were among the 251 people kidnapped during the   on southern Israel, in which Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people. Hamas is expected to release the living hostages within 72 hours, after which   will free 250 Palestinians serving long terms in Israeli prisons, and 1,700 others detained in Gaza during the war. A further 26 hostages held are presumed dead and the fate of two is unknown. Hamas has indicated that recovering the bodies of the dead may take longer than releasing those who are alive. Here are details of those who are expected to return home. In June, Angrest’s family released video that appeared to show the Israeli army soldier being pulled from a tank by scores of men at the Nahal Oz military base on 7 October 2023. “For me as a mother, it’s the hardest thing to watch,” Anat Angrest   as she explained she had decided to make the video public due to fears her son had been   by officials. The twin brothers were taken hostage at Kfar Aza kibbutz, less than two miles from the border with  . Speaking to the Guardian   their abduction, their older brother Liran Berman said life would never be the same. “We had our lives before October 7 and now we don’t know what will happen in the future,” he said. “Even if my brothers are released, it will leave lifelong scars.” Bohbot was taken captive at the Nova music festival during the raids on 7 October 2023. He had stayed behind to try to help those wounded during the attacks,   the American Jewish Committee. In May he was identified as the   published by Hamas’s armed wing. The video appeared to show Bohbot in duress. He said the bombardment could cost him his life and he pleaded to be reunited with his wife and son. Braslavski was also abducted at the Nova music festival, where he was working as a security guard,   the World Jewish Congress. His family was later told he had saved a number of people before being kidnapped. In April, he appeared in a video filmed by his captors in Gaza. The footage, which appeared to show him emaciated and in tears,  . Cohen, a corporal in the Israeli army, was guarding the area near the Nirim kibbutz close to Gaza’s frontier when his unit was overrun by armed militants, his father, Yehuda Cohen,   UN News. This week, as news emerged of the ceasefire deals, his father said it was the moment the family had been waiting for. “It could have come much earlier. Let this next three days pass with no one trying to sabotage it,”  . The two brothers were kidnapped from Nir Oz kibbutz. Ariel was   his girlfriend, Arbel Yehoud, who was released in January, while David was abducted with his wife, Sharon Aloni Cunio, who was released in November 2023 along with their three-year-old twin daughters, Ema and Yuly. Ariel and David’s father, Luis Cunio, this week   in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz detailing how the family had been “living the unknown” for two years. His granddaughters “don’t understand why their father and uncle aren’t returning; they live the trauma every day”, he said. “At night they wake up crying; all kinds of things. It’s very hard for us.” Their father expressed cautious optimism that the family’s ordeal would soon be over. “I hope we’ll see you soon, so hang on. We have no choice but to believe that at the end of the day, this story will end.” David was taken at the Nova music festival. In August his family expressed fears that Hamas was starving him after he was seen on video saying he had not eaten for days and had received barely any drinking water. The footage prompted outrage and dismay across Israel. In comments made under duress, David appeared to urge the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to agree to a ceasefire. In a statement, the   of starving David for propaganda. Gilboa-Dalal was at the Nova festival, dancing with his brother in a grove of trees just a few miles from Gaza. Soon after, he was kidnapped by Hamas. “It’s so hard missing him all day every day, thinking about him all day every day,” his brother, Gal Gilboa-Dalal,   this week. “And as time goes by it’s getting harder and harder [to bear], and harder and harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel.” Herkin was also at the Nova music festival when he was kidnapped. The Russian-Israeli dual citizen had attended the event by chance after being invited by friends at the last minute,  . Born in the Donbas region of Ukraine, he has a three-year-old daughter and was the primary provider for his mother and 11-year-old brother. Horn was kidnapped along with his brother, Iair, from Iair’s home in Nir Oz kibbutz. Iair was released in February and   in July that he had set aside his own recovery to focus on the release of his brother and the other hostages still in Gaza. “My life is frozen right now,” he said. “I live in a nightmare that every day they are kidnapping me anew.” This week, their father   about the imminent return of his son. “I felt good when I heard the news but I will feel much better when I see Eitan and the rest of the hostages. With God’s help, he will return on Monday from hell,” said Itzik Horn, 73. Kalfon was abducted as he was trying to leave the Nova festival. Earlier he had been on the phone with his family as the vehicle he was in slowly inched forward, trapped in a traffic jam of people trying to flee the area. “We were on the phone for an hour with him until 8.10am,” his father, Kobi Kalfon,   in July. “It was crazy, atomic pressure. I told them just to run.” A friend told the family that Hamas militants had approached the car and grabbed Segev, who at the time was studying finance at a Tel Aviv university. His family has spoken out about their worries about his health, particularly as he had been diagnosed with a severe form of anxiety and put on medication weeks before the 7 October attacks. Kupershtein was kidnapped at the Nova music festival, where he had been working as a bouncer. During the attack he stayed behind to assist the Israeli police and security team and provide first aid to the injured, according to the Jerusalem Post. In May his family was among the thousands of Israelis who took to the streets to call for a ceasefire that would bring the remaining hostages home from Gaza. “The only thing that keeps us going is the hope that Bar is alive and surviving,” his aunt Ora Rubinstein   at the time. Miran was at his home in kibbutz Nahal Oz with his wife, Lishay Lavi, and their daughters, Roni and Alma, when they were woken by sirens. As they took shelter in their safe room, word came that Hamas had begun to enter some of the homes. The militants forced one of their teenage neighbours to bang on the door of their safe room and it was made clear to them that the teenager and the family would be shot if they did not open up. The family did so and eventually Miran was tied up and led away, his wife  . “Roni was terrified, screaming. She tried to go with her daddy, I had to hold her back. I told Omri I love him and not to be a hero. I said do whatever they want because I want you back,” said Lavi. In August, Miran’s brother-in-law spoke to the US broadcaster NPR about the family’s ordeal. “Roni just celebrated her fourth birthday – a second without her father,”   said. “Alma is two years old, [she’s] never celebrated a birthday with her father. He was kidnapped when she was six months old.” Mor was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival. A survivor later said he had spotted Mor and a friend bringing others to safety before he was kidnapped,  . In February the family of Ohana said, without providing further details, that they had received a “clear” sign that he was alive, after being taken hostage at the Nova music festival. At the time of his capture, he and a friend had been attempting to provide aid to injured partygoers, according to the  , while the   said he had gone to the festival with friends to celebrate his imminent departure to the US to take a pilot course. “[He is a] strong guy, both in mind and body,” his aunt Hana Mastronov told reporters recently. “But there are limits to how much strength a person has.” Ohel was kidnapped at the Nova festival. In August, his mother wrote a piece for the Observer pleading for leaders around the world to do more to end the war and bring the hostages home. “My son and the other hostages, most of them young men, still have their whole lives ahead of them. I know that my son will play the piano again, filling the air with everything from Beethoven to Elton John to his own songs,”  . “I know my son will begin his studies at the music school where he was accepted, that he will surf again, cook again and do all the other things that brought a smile to his face. I want to believe that I will hug him again,” she added. “Please, help make that possible.” Or was kidnapped   along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, at the Nova music festival. Argamani was released after 245 days in captivity. Speaking this week, Argamani said: “Avinatan is someone words can’t describe.” She  : “There’s this quiet strength in him that radiates peace. One of the sayings he loved was: ‘A lion doesn’t have to roar to let the other animals know he’s king.’ That’s exactly who he is – always present, even when silent.” Zanguaker was abducted with his partner, Ilana Gritzewsky, from their home in Nir Oz kibbutz. Gritzewsky was released in November 2023. In a letter published this week, his mother, Einav Zangauker, said she was hoping to be able to hug her son soon. “For two years I’ve imagined how I will hold you close to my breast, the way a mother hugs her newborn child,”  . “I wonder what will be the first words I say.

Half awake, I call out in a hoarse voice to my two sisters who are sleeping on their beds next to me: “Enas, Remas, wake up – you have school.” We were not to know it yet, but this was the day when everything would change. The day when horrific events across the border in Israel would lead to a war that became a gateway to hell itself. I went back to sleep, not caring much whether my sisters woke up or not. My university classes started a little later at eight in the morning. Then suddenly came the sound of rockets firing. I could not tell if I was still dreaming. But soon my sisters and I were wide awake, and at first we told ourselves they were test rockets and would fall into the sea, so we didn’t care much, until the sound grew so loud it was impossible to ignore. Rumours started spreading – “maybe one of Hamas’s top leaders was assassinated, maybe Hamas was attacking Israel”, but everyone was guessing. Not comprehending what was happening, we waited for any confirmed piece of news. My uncle and his family came, still in their sleepwear and extremely agitated, since they live near the Israeli border. They were in a state of terror, their clothes messy, the interrupted sleep and their panicked departure visible on their faces. Some videos began to appear on social media showing Hamas storming into Israel and capturing dozens of people and taking them back to  . We could not grasp the scale of what had just happened. And then, the Israeli response began: a lot of bombing in all directions, the windows of the house trembling, and with them our hearts trembling, the sound of ambulances, all kinds of aircraft, and the cries of children. \n We have become used to war, and as in every war we have experienced, we started packing some of our belongings. We did not expect to be gone for long, so we only took the clothes we were wearing and one extra change, and gathered up the most important documents, putting them in school bags. On Friday 13 October, the pace of bombing on Beit Lahia increased. Leaflets were dropped telling us to evacuate. At that time we were afraid and reluctant to comply, but later that day, when we were making Thai food for dinner, the Israeli army started dropping smoke bombs on our houses until the city was covered with smoke. A state of terror broke out among our neighbours and everyone started running out of their homes, leaving everything behind. As for us, we left in our car, taking with us my grandfather and grandmother and our family of seven, and headed south for the first time. We did not know what was waiting for us. We thought we would stay for two or three weeks and then return. We did not expect that we would face dozens of wars instead of one. \n The second war we faced was finding a place to stay. We didn’t know where to go, we just kept moving south with no specific destination, our feelings swinging between fear, loss and hesitation. We ended up in an apartment in Deir, where we lived for three months, sleeping on the cold floor with no blankets or bed clothes. And there were the other wars, such as getting water and food, and the short life of the tents we had to live in. \n Despite obeying the evacuation orders and heading south, we found nowhere was safe. Not a day passed without the sounds of explosions, the roar of warplanes, shells and bullets fired by Israeli naval boats. We always imagined waking up to find the wall of the apartment falling on us. I had visions of remaining alive, alone amid rubble, screaming for my family but getting no response. We wrote our names on a piece of paper and put it in our pockets in case the house was bombed and we all died, so that paper would serve as an identity card if our faces were erased. When we felt the danger getting closer, we decided to go and live in tents in Rafah. The situation was a little better than living in an apartment, and at least those nightmares stopped. In the first week we were very happy, imagining it was our first camping trip in rainy winter weather, but what we didn’t know the challenge we would face in getting water and food, and in contending with the punishing, severe cold. We were constantly falling ill. \n My younger brother Ibrahim and I were infected with Hepatitis A, suffering so much that sometimes we felt as though we were dying. There was no medicine. All we could do was take strict safety and hygiene measures so that the rest of the family wouldn’t get infected. When the ground invasion of Rafah began, we moved many times from one place to another, living in tents. It is hard to describe the feeling of being forced to live in this way. Only those who have experienced it can fully understand it. Faced with a lack of clean and safe food and water, we had to stand for hours and walk long distances to get them. We endured extreme heat in summer, turning to bitter cold in winter. On top of that were the insects, rats and stray animals. Our education and healthcare, our simplest rights, simply evaporated. During our displacement in Khan Younis, my grandmother fell ill. She struggled with the illness for weeks until it overcame her. She stayed in the hospital for a week, receiving treatment that was not sufficient due to the large number of cases, which caused dozens to die weekly, and then my grandmother was among them. The pain of losing her was very hard. She was a second mother to me. She had lived with us since I was born and took care of us while my mother was busy with her studies. After my grandmother’s death, we started trying to build a life in the south since hope of returning to the north had vanished. My father and uncles started planting some crops to make us feel like we were back home in Beit Lahia, and this indeed helped us move forward and gave us a little sense of security. Then came the ceasefire in January 2025. I still remember the joy of the residents returning to the north, where almost all of them returned on the first day without taking much with them. Others, out of excitement, burned their tents thinking that the suffering in the south had ended. We returned to Beit Lahia. Sadness engulfed its corners, its destroyed houses and its dry fields, the silence hanging over its streets serving to tell its returning residents what had happened after they were forced to leave. We began trying to rebuild, clearing the rubble and stones, putting up tents next to the destroyed houses and planting some new plants to break the grey colour and give everyone hope that life could bloom again. But that hope vanished. The war came back to burn everything once more. Fear and anxiety returned as we once more moved from one place to another, amid explosion after explosion, death after death. I lost my dear uncle Bahjat, killed by a tank shell while he and my father were collecting some of our possessions from an old shelter. Two weeks later, we were displaced yet again and rented an apartment in Gaza City. This was a bigger and worse siege than the one before, and we started suffering from hunger, which caused the death of hundreds – children and the elderly. We would share one loaf of bread between us all, and sometimes, when we couldn’t find any bread to eat, we went to sleep hungry, trying to stave it off by drinking water, which often came to us contaminated. Then, out of nowhere, came the plan to occupy Gaza City, and we were forced to evacuate to the south yet again. This week, when the ceasefire deal was announced, the streets filled with whistling and cheering and everyone started jumping and dancing with joy, hoping that this time the war would end for ever. But they remain afraid it might fail at the last moment, preparing themselves for the worst, so they are not struck down with despair if it does collapse. I look back on how my life was the day before 7 October: going to work to teach girls swimming, then celebrating my cousin’s wedding, where we had all gathered happily, wearing dresses and putting on lots of makeup. I remember my university, where I only stayed for one month. I remember my grandmother and my uncle Bahjat, whose death we sometimes envied. I am sure all the people of Gaza have such memories dancing in their minds: family meals, friends – many now dead – the normal and everyday. We all wonder if we will ever get the chance to live such lives again.", "tags": ["israel-gaza:", "two", "years", "on", "gaza", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "palestine", "israel-gaza", "war", "features"]},

Heather McMahan apologised to McIlroy and Ryder Cup Europe for the remarks. It took the PGA of America 20 hours to address  , which happened before dawn on Saturday, which invited questions about whether it was quick enough to act. McMahan had been employed to stoke up the crowd on the first tee in an attempt to build the atmosphere, and was using a megaphone to lead them in their chants. She tried to persuade them to join her in a chorus of “Scottie! Scottie! Scheffler!” to the tune of Queen’s We Will Rock You but was booed into abandoning the effort. “Fuck you Rory!” was more popular, and became a persistent chant throughout the day. McIlroy responded by blowing the crowd kisses when he came to the tee. It set the tone of an ugly day at Bethpage, when the atmosphere around McIlroy in particular became so toxic that the PGA of America brought in squads of state police and park police to walk the course with his group midway through their round. Several spectators were evicted. McIlroy was repeatedly targeted with personal abuse and grew so exasperated with people shouting out during his backswing that at one point he turned around and told the crowd to “shut the fuck up”. The PGA of America repeatedly posted spectator etiquette warnings on the screens around the grounds. They were widely booed every time they appeared. McIlroy described the atmosphere as “very, very challenging”. He won both matches regardless. “I don’t mind them having a go at us,” McIlroy said. “Like that’s to be expected. I mean, that’s what an away   is. Whenever they are still doing it while you are over the ball and trying to hit your shot, that’s the tough thing. You know, look, in between shots, say whatever you want to me. That’s totally fine. But just give us the respect to let us hit shots.”", "tags": ["ryder", "cup", "2025", "golf", "ryder", "cup", "us", "sports", "rory", "mcilroy", "news"]},

There are   to shun Israeli and Israeli-adjacent businesses, ban the country from sporting and cultural events, and cut ties with its  . From stadiums to the high street, from concert halls to the political stage, the boycott movement is moving from the fringe to the mainstream. While most of the voices in this article spoke before Israel and Hamas agreed to a  , activists are vowing to keep up the pressure. The boycott, divestment and sanctions movement   the plan to end the war as a “scheme primarily designed by Israel’s fascist government to save it from its unprecedented global isolation”, and called on civil society to step up its efforts. Revulsion at Israel’s wartime conduct has mounted, as   and the death toll exceeded 67,000 people, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Last month a team of independent experts commissioned by the UN’s human rights council concluded that Israel was committing genocide. While criticism of Israeli policy is not new, the war in Gaza has acted as a catalyst, shattering taboos, emboldening dissent and pushing public and political sentiment into uncharted territory. Many observers see a turning point on the horizon – one that recalls the global campaign against apartheid in South Africa. , president of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group, said: “It’s as big a shift as I’ve seen in my life regarding attitudes not only in the American Jewish community but the public broadly. Ben-Ami added: “I don’t think that this is somehow in any way antisemitic or anti-Israel. It’s a rejection of this government and the policies of the Israeli government over not just the last couple of years but going back a few decades at this point.” It is now 20 years since Palestinian civil society organisations   for BDS (boycott, divestment, sanctions) as a form of non-violent pressure on Israel, taking the South African anti-apartheid movement as their inspiration and calling for an end to Israel’s occupation and the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. BDS was reviled by conservatives and opposed by the Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Dozens of US states, red and blue, have passed   over the years to penalize boycotts of Israel. But a combination of generational change, revulsion at the events in   and alienation caused by Benjamin Netanyahu’s extreme rightwing government is giving BDS new traction, even if many of the actions to target Israel are not formally taking place under the movement’s banner. In May, 380 writers and organisations including Zadie Smith and Ian McEwan   stating that the war in Gaza is genocidal and calling for an immediate ceasefire, after an earlier   from the literary community announcing a boycott of most Israeli cultural institutions. Last month more than  , many from Hollywood, signed a pledge to boycott “complicit” Israeli film institutions and festivals. Eurovision song contest organisers have said member countries will vote in November on whether Israel can participate next year. The event is hugely popular in Israel and its most recent victory – Toy by Netta Barzilai in 2018 – provoked wild  . , an Israeli analyst and pollster and visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, said a Eurovision boycott could make particularly big waves: “It is a cultural phenomenon in Israel. They love it. It’s seen as a total source of national pride that Israel participates and does a good job and has occasionally won. I don’t have a precedent for how Israel would react if they were kicked out.” Elsewhere in the music world, hundreds of artists from Björk to Massive Attack have   to block their music from being streamed in Israel. Then there is football. Fifa and Uefa, the sport’s governing bodies, are facing pressure to ban Israel from international competition. The former Manchester United star Eric Cantona has led calls for bodies to suspend Israel and for clubs to refuse to play Israeli teams. Last month a billboard in New York’s Times Square displayed the message “Israel is committing genocide.” It was part of a campaign by  , which calls for a boycott of Israel’s national team, a boycott of Israeli clubs and a ban on Israeli players. “Normalisation in an abnormal time of prolonged genocide is complicity,” said  , one of the organisers. “As long as they step on our football pitches or appear at Eurovision, we are saying we are OK with occupation, we are OK with apartheid and we are OK with genocide.” Boycott opponents argue that the efforts are counterproductive and target the innocent, with Israeli film workers and academics in particular arguing that boycotting them silences the country’s most critical voices. But proponents say the isolation is the point. “The more isolated Israel gets, the more it realises the world is against its actions, the more its population realises the repercussions of its actions,” said Prashar, a former adviser to Tony Blair when he was Middle East envoy. “People will say to me, ‘Oh, is that collective punishment?’ What do you think Gaza is? Collective punishment is actually what’s happening in Gaza. We’re holding them accountable for committing these atrocities by isolating them.” The campaign against white minority rule in South Africa offers a historical touchstone and strategic playbook. The country was banned from the Olympics from 1964 onwards; Fifa expelled South Africa in 1976; cricket, rugby and tennis bodies followed, leading to almost total exclusion from big competitions. The slogan “No normal sport in an abnormal society” became a rallying cry. Writers, musicians and artists were urged not to perform in South Africa or publish their work there. Consumers were urged to shun South African goods such as fruit, cigarettes and alcohol and complicit companies including Shell and Barclays. , a history professor who was active in the anti-apartheid divestment movement in the 1980s, recalled that liberation organisations inside South Africa “explicitly called for a cultural boycott”, which international allies then worked to enforce. The logic was “to isolate South Africa and South Africans on the world stage”, a key pressure point that played a “major role in the dooming of apartheid”. Since the war broke out in Gaza, companies such as McDonald’s,   and Coca-Cola have faced boycotts because of their connections to Israel, while some Israeli-owned companies in the US have been targeted. In a speech last month, Netanyahu acknowledged his country’s growing economic isolation, urging Israel to become a “ ” of the Middle East. , a founder of the BDS movement and a recipient of the Gandhi peace award, said: “I wrote back in 2009 that our   was nearing. Now I think it’s much nearer than ever because the BDS movement is beginning to affect policy. Netanyahu – and we – see the writing on the wall.” Even before the war broke out, Barghouti noted, thousands of artists supported a cultural boycott of Israel, but now the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) has seen a “drastic qualitative leap”. “It’s no longer just the progressive artists joining the cultural boycotts; we’ve always had the Lauryn Hills and the Lordes and the more progressive artists, who are established and not in precarious situations where they would lose their career, though they took very courageous stances. “But since the genocide, we’ve reached the ivory tower of  , the  , the fashion industry, famous  , makeup artists, major influencers, writers … We’ve never seen such traction before.” The South African comparison is not an entirely neat one, however. First, the anti-apartheid movement had a clear, unified political leadership in Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC), a structure the Palestinian movement currently lacks. Second, Israel is far more integrated into the global economy and technology sectors, making it significantly harder to isolate than South Africa was. While the cultural boycotts are symbolically significant and some countries have restricted arms sales and trade ties, it is not clear how much Israel’s economy has been affected. Haaretz recently   that Europe’s spending on Israeli weapons was at a record high. Third, Israel has powerful reservoirs of international support – from the US government to Christian Zionists and Jewish Americans – that create a buffer against isolation efforts. Fourth, Netanyahu has sympathy from fellow strongmen around the world, including Donald Trump. The difference can be seen in the student movements of both efforts – when the anti-apartheid movement took hold on college campuses in the US,   university administrations to divest from companies doing business in South Africa. This generation’s student movement has similarly demanded its schools divest from Israel – but faces a very different political climate and an aggressive crackdown from Washington. , author of Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza, said: “Israel’s capacity to maintain its authoritarian system of control of the Palestinians, instead of cutting against the grain of politics in other countries, in some ways is actually at the vanguard of the rise of ethno-nationalist authoritarians around the world. “South Africa was not a model for anybody in the late 1980s. But Israel is a model, whether it’s for Modi [in India] or Orbán [in Hungary] or the AfD [in Germany] or the Republican party in the United States to some degree. For all of those reasons it’s a much more uphill struggle, even though we are seeing shifts in public opinion.” Beinart, a professor at the  , added: “There’s no question that there’s been a cultural shift. You can see it dramatically in public opinion. You can see it in popular culture. What’s not clear is how that shift in public opinion and popular culture is going to translate into elections and public policy. That’s the real question.”", "tags": ["gaza", "israel-gaza:", "two", "years", "on", "israel", "israel-gaza", "war", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "palestine", "features"]},

So easy to say, much harder to actually accomplish. Anybody in any doubt about that need only ask  . A   broke out under the blaring sun at Bethpage Black on Sunday. The competitive spirit summoned by the United States of America ultimately was not enough to rip the 17-inch trophy back from Europe’s grasp but wow, did they give Donald and his players a shuddering fright. A singles session that started with the visitors eyeing a procession and record breaking was dominated by Keegan Bradley’s US team. Donald surely feared one of the worst sporting capitulations of our time. How would they recover? How would Europe’s golfers ever recover? They have been spared that nightmare. It was not  , Justin Rose or Tommy Fleetwood who carried Europe over the line at Bethpage. Instead, Donald and his players collapsed in an exhausted heap as Shane Lowry holed out from 6ft on the final green of match eight to ensure at least a draw. The record books will show a European win, 15-13. They will not depict the breathlessness. For Lowry, this was as epic a moment as when he won the 2019 Open Championship. A golfing continent exhaled as Lowry danced across the putting surface with unbridled joy. “That was the hardest couple of hours of my whole life,” a tearful Lowry said. “ I can’t believe that putt went in. The Ryder Cup means everything to me.” How precarious this situation was can be explained by the fact that when Lowry took to the 18th tee, Europe held no lead in the four games left on the course. The Irishman was one down. Russell Henley hit a glorious bunker shot to set up a chance of sealing his point. Henley, incredibly, left his putt short. Cometh the hour, cometh the Offaly man. This was, eventually, a triumph for Donald’s diligence and planning. It should also, though, serve as a reference point for spectator behaviour. Too much of what transpired in New York, largely towards the visiting team, should never be seen at a Ryder Cup again.   should be proud of its failure to embrace a yobbish culture. It should recoil at the abuse dished out to Europe as they rampaged towards victory. Adare Manor in 2027 has to and surely will be totally different. McIlroy’s defeat by Scottie Scheffler was due in no small part to the mental exhaustion suffered by the Masters champion. The treatment of McIlroy over three days here was disgraceful. There was an on-course ruckus to add to the mix. Bradley became irritated by the drop given to Rose – or the time taken to decide on it – on the 13th, the Englishman’s second shot to the par five having found a road. After a delay of about 15 minutes, with Bradley still chuntering in the ear of a referee, Rose played from scrubland at the back of a spectator stand; quite wonderfully, as it transpired. Rose’s shot finished within 6ft of the hole, from where he converted to pull one back against Cameron Young. As Rose won the 14th as well, Young’s lead was suddenly under threat. Bradley continued to mump and moan. Young lightened his captain’s mood with an 11ft putt on the final green to snatch a point from game one. Justin Thomas backed up Young by seeing off Fleetwood, again on the last. Bryson DeChambeau had been five down after seven to Matt Fitzpatrick but rescued half a point. “I love my country,” said DeChambeau, in typically understated fashion. Scheffler’s game with McIlroy also went the distance, the world No 1 signing off from what was overall a disappointing tournament on a high. “This has been a really special team and it’s been a lot of fun,” Scheffler said. He is, however, clearly far more at home in individual battle. Light relief for Donald was supplied by Ludvig Åberg, who beat Patrick Cantlay 2&1. Half a point needed. Half a point! Red was added to the leaderboard by Xander Schauffele, who defeated Jon Rahm, and JJ Spaun’s success over Sepp Straka. Europe were now firmly in squeaky bum territory. Rasmus Højgaard was struggling against Ben Griffin in the battle of the Ryder Cup rookies and Tyrrell Hatton was locked in a tense battle against Collin Morikawa. Could match 11 of 11, where Robert MacIntyre was taking on Sam Burns, really be pivotal? Lowry ended that notion. Griffin prevailed, Hatton halved with Morikawa, before Burns three-putted the last for the same result. Europe won just one singles game to the US half-dozen. Europe’s Sunday task had been simplified further by the removal of Viktor Hovland from the singles because of a neck injury. In what was a rare example of the Ryder Cup’s envelope rule, the US player pre-determined by Bradley to sit out in a scenario such as this was revealed as Harris English. Both teams took half a point. In keeping with the tone of this competition, US fans heckled Hovland as he watched his teammates from the fairways.

But until the thrilling denouement, the lasting memory of this Ryder Cup threatened not to be a single swing of the club so much as the ugly backdrop: galleries that drifted from partisan into venomous and the organizers who let the line slide until it snapped. It didn’t happen all at once. For the first day and a half of golf’s most intense rivalry, it was New York-loud without being unruly. Then Saturday afternoon arrived and the tenor shifted.  , the visiting lightning rod, kept stepping off shots as volleys of abuse landed in the quiet of his pre-shot routine. Shane Lowry played teammate and minder. Justin Thomas, not exactly a shrinking violet, began shushing his own end of the grandstand so his opponents could putt. There’s a difference between atmosphere and interference, and Bethpage spent too much of the weekend blurring the two. Boos during practice swings and the sing-song “YEW-ESS-AY! YEW-ESS-AY!” after a European miss were tiresome, but survivable. What crept in on Saturday was different: insults aimed at players’ wives, homophobic slurs, cheap shots at McIlroy’s nationality dripping with tiresome stereotypes, gleeful reminders of Pinehurst the moment McIlroy crouched over anything inside five feet. Europe answered with performance. So much for home advantage: for two years the Bethpage sales pitch was the snarling, uniquely American cauldron that would rattle Europe. Message received, but the idiots took it literally. Add the optics of Donald Trump’s fly-in on Friday – fist bumps, photo-ops, galleries dotted with Maga hats and a certain politics of humiliation playing to its base – and the swagger slid easily into license. That doesn’t make the Ryder Cup a referendum. It does explain how quickly the rope line starts to feel like a boundary you’re invited to test. Given the guest of honor’s well-known aversion to losing gracefully, it was hardly a shock that the worst behavior broke out just as America’s chances were slipping away. But the tournament’s response to the ugly crowd conduct on Saturday was woeful. Extra security and a phalanx of New York state troopers materialized around McIlroy’s match at the turn. A couple of spectators were ejected near the main grandstands. The PGA of America said it bolstered policing and pushed more frequent spectator etiquette messages on the big screens. Fine, as far as it goes. But once a thousand people have decided a backswing is their cue, you can’t manage it with a graphic and a frown. Enforcement has to be swift, visible and consequential or it becomes permission by another name. Sunday brought a tacit admission that the line had been crossed. The first-tee master of ceremonies, the comedian Heather McMahan, stepped down from her role after video   of “Fuck you Rory!” on Saturday morning. The PGA   and apology before the singles. If the MC is amplifying the worst instincts in the building, that’s not “energy”; it’s an institutional failure. Luke Donald chose his words carefully as he praised his team’s “anti-fragile” temperament and drew a firm boundary between “raucous” and “personal”. Keegan Bradley, the USA captain, bristled at any suggestion the US room had licensed the excess. He   and pointed – not incorrectly – to his team’s flat play as a trigger for their restlessness. But that defense only goes so far. You can be partisan without being toxic. You can fill a grandstand without emptying your standards. It’s also true that many Americans tried to keep the thing on the rails. Thomas kept waving for hush. Cameron Young never took the bait. Plenty of fans actually supported their own rather than savaging the other lot. Too often, though, they were drowned out by the performative tough guys in flag suits and plastic chains who treat the   like a tailgate with better lawn care. But framing Bethpage as a one-off misses the larger point. What happened here didn’t invent the tone of American life so much as reflect what’s been an incremental breakdown in public behavior. The country now lives in all-caps, from school-board meetings that sound like street rallies and comment sections that have spilled into the street. The algorithm bankrolls outrage, the put-down is political vernacular and the culture applauds “saying the quiet part out loud”. In 2025 you can say almost anything in public and be cheered for it ( ). Put a rope line and a microphone in front of that mix and you get exactly what you got at the Ryder Cup: people testing boundaries not because the moment needs them to, but because they’ve been told volume is virtue. Some might argue golf, in the US particularly, has always been a sport for white conservatives, but it’s hard to remember galleries calling opposing players “faggots” and openly deriding their wives until recently. What could have changed? Europe didn’t need rescuing. They rescued themselves. That could be seen on Saturday, when McIlroy and Lowry won their afternoon match two up in the eye of the storm. Rose and Fleetwood then dispatched Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau 3&2 after a tense exchange about who had the stage; then they took the stage and won. Donald’s players came to New York expecting a test of nerve and got it at full blast. Sunday gave us a memorable finish. But this week will also be remembered for the noise that wasn’t passion, the hostility that wasn’t edge and the adults who mistook the difference. Next time the Cup crosses the Atlantic, at Hazeltine in 2029, whether during Trump’s third term or not, the hosts will have a choice to make about what kind of event they want to run – and what kind of country they want it to reflect.", "tags": ["ryder", "cup", "2025", "ryder", "cup", "golf", "us", "sports", "donald", "trump", "rory", "mcilroy", "features"]},

The man who’d won everything wanted to win this more than anything. It had been on his mind ever since the last one at Marco Simone, when he startled the media, his captain, and his teammates by launching into a speech about how he was targeting victory here at Bethpage. “I’ve said this for the last six years to anyone that will listen: I think one of the biggest accomplishments in golf right now is winning an away  ,” McIlroy said back then, “and that’s what we’re going to do”. And in the end McIlroy was just about as good as his word. And if anyone was starting to doubt the truth of exactly how hard it all was after the beating the USA took during the first two days’ play here, Sunday’s singles were all the evidence they needed to see just how right McIlroy was. The weathermen said it was the hottest day yet at Bethpage, but in other ways it felt like the temperature had dropped in the morning. The fever that had gripped the place on Saturday had broken. McIlroy still had to step away from the ball while playing the first hole. Somebody shouted out “Fuck you!” in the silence that fell before his putt. But this time a couple of burly policemen waded into the gallery and the crowd around the heckler started chanting “Get him out! Get him out!” For all Keegan Bradley’s talk about how his team could still win even though they were trailing by seven in the morning, no one here seemed to be buying it, and while this European team, and McIlroy in particular, still had to put up   there wasn’t the same vicious edge there had been the day before. Maybe there was a collective acceptance that the abuse was out of hand on Saturday, maybe it was the extra effort made by the PGA of America to police the bad behaviour, or maybe it was just that it’s harder to scream “You suck!” and mean it when you’re team’s on the wrong end of a beating. McIlroy won’t care either way now his team have won. He gave everything he had to give to his team here, and by the end he seemed so drained by everything he has been through that he didn’t have anything much left for his singles match against  . The emotional, mental, and physical effort of playing four games in two days, and dealing with all the abuse that came his way while he was doing it, had left him running on fumes. It was a strange game. World No 1 v World No 2, the man who won this year’s Masters against the man who  , the last winner of the career grand slam champion against someone who will, most likely, be the next winner of the career grand slam. Maybe it was because the match was so heavyweight that it never really got off the ground. It ought to have been a game for the ages, but it ended up more like a game for the aged. The two greatest players of their generation turned in some pretty creaky golf, and played a handful of shots that made everyone watching feel a lot better about the state of their own game. On the 2nd, Scheffler whiffed a chip a couple of club lengths ahead into the rough when he was 30 feet from the pin. “It’s OK, Scottie!” an American fan cried out, “No it’s not Scottie!” his friend added as punctuation. It still wasn’t as bad as the one Scheffler served up from the middle of the 10th fairway, when he blew his approach 40 yards left after finishing his swing one-handed. Amazingly, Scheffler still won the hole with a bogey, since McIlroy wasn’t doing too much better and ended up duffing his own chip a couple of feet and making a double. It went on like this until Scheffler eventually won 1 up on 18. Sign up to  The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion One down on the day, but three and a half up on the week, McIlroy will be able to look back and know he showed the best of himself, and that he got what he wanted out of playing here. Scheffler, though, will remember it as   weeks of his career. He became the first player in history to play all four pairs matches for his side and yet lose every one. He’s putted this week like a sea-legged sailor squeezing a round in during shore-leave. Scheffler is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a Texas golfer. He is by all accounts, a grand team man, who even helped organise the USA’s practice camp at Napa last week because he was so determined to win here. “Scottie has been the best teammate in our team room this week, without question, period,” insisted Bradley. You guess he’s not going to be the last US captain to tie himself in knots trying to figure out how to get the best out of Scheffler in this competition. If anyone ever figures it out, the near impossible job McIlroy took on this time around will be that much harder again.", "tags": ["ryder", "cup", "2025", "rory", "mcilroy", "ryder", "cup", "golf", "scottie", "scheffler", "us", "sports", "analysis"]},

McIlroy confirmed his wife, Erica, was hit by a beer that was thrown during Saturday afternoon’s play. “I don’t think we should ever accept that in golf,” said McIlroy. “I think golf should be held to a higher standard than what was seen out there this week. Golf has the ability to unite people. Golf teaches you very good life lessons. It teaches you etiquette. It teaches you how to play by the rules. It teaches you how to respect people. Sometimes this week we didn’t see that. So no, this should not be what is acceptable in the  . We will be making sure to say to our fans in Ireland in 2027 that what happened here this week is not acceptable. “Come and support your team. I think if I was an American, I would be annoyed … I didn’t hear a lot of shouts for Scottie [Scheffler] today, but I heard a lot of shouts against me. It’s like, support your players. That’s the thing. “It was a rough week for all of us. But at the same time, we shut them up by our performance and how we played. I chirped back a few times because it got to me a few times, but we tried to handle everything that came our way with class and poise, and for the most part, I felt like we did that.” Shane Lowry, McIlroy’s close friend, added: “I was out there for two days with Erica McIlroy and the amount of abuse that she received was astonishing. The way she was out there supporting her husband and supporting her team was unbelievable.” McIlroy replied in jest when asked what it was like playing Ryder Cup matches with police officers and dogs lining fairways. “I wish they had let the dogs off the leashes,” he said. “The police out there and the amount of security presence was insane. Look, nothing was going to happen. There wasn’t going to be physical altercation or anything like that but there was a lot of language that was unacceptable and abusive behaviour. “It should be off limits but obviously it wasn’t this week. Erica is fine. She’s a very, very strong woman. She handled everything this week with class and poise and dignity like she always has. I love her and we’re going to have a good time celebrating tonight.” The Masters champion was only slightly more serious when asked how it felt to fire an iron shot to close range after turning to ask spectators to “shut the fuck up” as they heckled him before he hit. “Very fucking satisfying,” McIlroy said. Keegan Bradley, the defeated US captain, criticised the rule whereby both the hosts and Europe received singles half points before a Sunday ball was struck. Injury sustained by Viktor Hovland meant Bradley had to remove one of his own players, Harris English, from the draw. This moved Europe to within two points of retaining the Cup. “It has to change,” said Bradley. “I think it’s obvious to everybody in the sports world, in this room.

I didn’t think they would be this tough, they fought so hard, and all respect to them. “But this means a lot obviously to me and the team. We came here knowing that the task was very difficult.

I’m so, so, happy for them.” Jon Rahm joined McIlroy in heaping praise on Donald. “Luke has set the bar for captaincy so extremely high,” said the Spaniard. “What he’s done these four years is absolutely astonishing.

This will involve tearing up parts of the course, despite being told there is “a high probability” of burial sites 1.5 metres underneath the grass. Several academics and Indigenous elders have told the government the southern section of the course contains a “substantial archaeological record” of a large-scale ceremonial precinct, known as Pirltawardli, which was a gathering place for the Kaurna people. Government documents show Pirltawardli has been recognised as playing a “central role in the history of South Australian race relations” and once hosted an Indigenous language school, a colonial store and the first Christian mission in the state. The course upgrade has not been finalised. But the government has conceded bones could be disturbed. A report by the Attorney-General’s Department outlines the plan to deal with human remains that “cannot be avoided”. They would be removed by an archaeologist. “This is quite distressing,” said Mitzi Nam, the chair of the Kaurna Yerta Aboriginal Corporation, the native title owners of the Pirltawardli. “This is really making our community very anxious as there has been no consultation. We know there’s a need for development, but there should be more compassion about what this land means to us”. Nam said she had an informal discussion about the site with the state’s minister for Aboriginal affairs, Kyam Maher, but that there had been no formal consultation about the course design. Under the state’s Heritage Act, the site cannot be disturbed without ministerial permission. A government spokesperson said there had been consultation with tradition owners and the Indigenous community about the application, including a public meeting. A deadline for submissions was extended to facilitate more feedback. “Consultation on the application has closed and a report is currently being prepared for a decision,” the spokesperson said. “It just makes me feel sick,” said Lynette Crocker, the chair of the Kaurna Nation Cultural Heritage Association, who has also recently discussed the proposal with Maher. Crocker said more than 1,500 of her ancestors had already been removed from burial sites along the River Torrens and stored in museums. In recent years, Kaurna elders have sought to rebury their ancestors to  “I have said on numerous occasions to state government, if you don’t do anything else for Kaurna people, return their ancient ones to where they come from. They are spiritually angry with successive governments. “It’s not only frustrating, it is demoralising and shows a total disrespect for Kaurna people and our elders and ancient ones.” Susan Dixon, a Kaurna custodian and a member of the state’s First Nations voice to parliament, said her people had a deep spiritual and historical link to Pirltawardli.

It should have the same value.” Dr Jenni Caruso, an Eastern Arrente woman and academic at Adelaide University who has researched the site’s cultural importance, said “they should not be doing it in any way, shape or form”. “It is the foundations of this state that are being disturbed,” Caruso said. “Once again, we become disposable don’t we? Our history falls into the bucket of disposables as it doesn’t carry a dollar alignment.” The state government has highlighted analysis from consultants Vision Insights, which claims the LIV tournament brought $81m to the state in 2025, with 86,000 “visitor nights” from tourists. The City of Adelaide’s reconciliation council wrote to the state government earlier this month and said the site should be preserved to demonstrate respect for Kaurna custodianship. “Any redevelopment must ensure the site is safeguarded, honoured and interpreted in ways that support cultural continuity and broader community understanding,” a letter to the state government said.

Cameron Young.

Not sure if it counts as best or not but Lowry certainly has the scariest. There were times during his Saturday fourball when you couldn’t tell if he was celebrating another good putt or wading in to settle a bar fight.

Or was it Lowry’s spicy two-word clapback at an unruly spectator after his eagle from 50ft to turn the Saturday fourballs classic blue?

Watson’s comments come after Rory McIlroy confirmed  . “I’d like to congratulate Europe on their victory,”  . “Your team play the first few days was sensational. More importantly, I’d like to apologise for the rude and mean-spirited behaviour from our American crowd at Bethpage. As a former player, captain and as an American I am ashamed of what happened.” Watson, an eight-time major winner who played in five Ryder Cups and captained the US team in 2014, also relayed his apology directly to the European team. His comments are in stark contrast to the class of 2025.   and the American captain,  of properly condemning the situation at Bethpage despite police and dogs lining fairways. “I don’t think we should ever accept that in golf,” said   towards himself and his wife.

His approach to captaincy in Rome two years ago and New York has been widely praised. It seems inevitable he will be involved in some capacity in the future. For now, he is not completely ruling out a third term. Donald had taken guidance from tennis players, including the three-time US Open champion Ivan Lendl, on how to handle a New York crowd. Lendl defeated home favourite John McEnroe for the first of his victories, in 1985. Donald believed the backdrops to tennis and golf, where spectators are urged to remain quiet for shots, were the most comparable. “The weeks we spend together are the ones we remember the most and the ones we cherish the most because of the time we get to spend with each other,” he said. “That’s a big part of my captaincy, to create an environment where these guys are having the best weeks of their lives. We’ll always remember this. We’ll always go down in history. “We talk about all the people that came before us that paved the way for us. Now future generations will talk about this team and what they did and how they were able to overcome one of the toughest environments in all of sport.” Justin Rose had been the most likely European captain for 2025 and Adare Manor in Ireland. However, Rose’s playing performance here may give him cause to think he could compete again in two years’ time. Francesco Molinari would come into the frame in that circumstance.

Such a close friendship   means not only is sporting comparison inevitable but questions towards Lowry are routinely framed with the Northern Irishman in mind. What does Rory think, what would Rory say. Lowry takes it all in good spirit – the vast majority of the time – when he would be entitled to roll his eyes. That also applies to the rogue depiction of the hard-drinking Irishman who has a natural talent for his sport that removes a need for hard work. There are few more dedicated or serious performers than Lowry. He cares almost too much. McIlroy’s outstanding achievements in golf do not extend to what Lowry produced on Sunday. A stirring comeback from the USA had left Europe in serious danger of letting the Ryder Cup slip through a dozen pairs of hands. It was left to Lowry   to ensure at least a tie. The man American fans had called a Teletubby over the Ryder Cup’s earlier two days would enjoy the last, deafening laugh. “I still can’t believe it,” Lowry said on Monday morning. Had Lowry missed, Europe were staring at sporting disaster.  . If it was only natural to look at the negative, Lowry’s mindset was different. He had turned to his caddie, Darren Reynolds, earlier on the 18th hole. “I have a chance to do the coolest thing in my life here,” Lowry told his bag man. “I did it. And I’m very proud of myself.” On the green, Lowry thought of Martin Kaymer’s converted putt, in identical circumstances for Europe, at Medinah in 2012. Lowry has an uncanny knack of being at the epicentre of storied events. He was invited to the 2009 Irish Open as an amateur and won. When the Open Championship returned to Ireland a decade later, he prevailed again. Lowry’s latest moment in the sun came on the very day his brother’s wife was having a baby. The golfer’s father, Brendan, an All-Ireland football champion in 1982, looked on as the Bethpage putt dropped. Lowry’s celebration – so euphoric and so natural – was wonderfully endearing. He had to pause for air at the end. And to think, Shane once dreamed of following in Brendan’s sporting footsteps. He was instead destined to shine on a global stage. The plan did not involve it all coming down to Lowry of course. He was in match eight of 11 Sunday singles. Europe started the session needing only two points to retain the cup. Yet the very point of putting Lowry – plus Tyrrell Hatton and Robert MacIntyre – at the base of the draw was just in case their games were needed. “I didn’t envision myself going up the 18th needing a birdie to retain the  ,” Lowry admitted. “It was the worst two hours of my life. It was horrible.” There was also an element of redemption. Lowry had yearned to play in the Ryder Cup before receiving a wildcard pick for Whistling Straits in 2021. His debut, in partnership with McIlroy, involved a heavy defeat against Tony Finau and Harris English. Lowry lost in the singles against Patrick Cantlay as the USA inflicted a record defeat on Europe. Much is made of McIlroy’s tears in Wisconsin but Lowry was similarly distraught. “No matter how long I play, for the rest of my career I’ll want to be part of this team,” Lowry said at the time. Through a subsequent changing of the guard, Lowry has remained part of the European group who have won back-to-back cups. Lowry is hugely respected among his European teammates. He has influence and fuels camaraderie way beyond the golf course. He is a great storyteller, quick-witted and does a fine line in self-deprecation. The 38‑year‑old is fiercely loyal, not least towards McIlroy. Lowry is in fact central to everything that makes Europe so successful as a team; everything the USA cannot seem to get quite right. “I’m so proud of Shane,” McIlroy said. “I’m so grateful to have him in my life. Honestly, he put his arm around me on Saturday afternoon and he was a big reason we won that point. He has been immense this week. Sign up to  The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion “This is Shane’s third Ryder Cup and it is his best performance, absolutely immense. What Shane did will stay with [him] for the rest of his career.” McIlroy’s assessment, as ever, is spot on. He was clearly tired during the fourball session on day two when Lowry stepped forward. It needn’t always be the Rory show. The big brother he never had helped out. “You think back to the Irish greats in the game, they have all holed putts to win the Ryder Cup and I got my moment,” Lowry added, in reference to Eamonn Darcy, Philip Walton, Paul McGinley, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke. Lowry is proud of his heritage and his homeland. Thoughts will turn inevitably towards how Lowry might build on this. He has the ability to add to his solitary major success. In two years’ time, he will be back on Team Europe at Adare Manor. He is a future captain in waiting. But that big picture can wait. MacIntyre revealed he and Lowry planned to vanish into New York.

There’s a danger we start to believe it’s easy, expected, nothing special. Or that it just happens by magic in an instant on a golf green or a rugby pitch. We envisage “Henry V speeches” on the eve of battle urging players to make their mark on history moments before stepping into the arena. But at the weekend, two of the finest sports teams in the world demonstrated how months and years of intentional, deep culture-building are necessary to create a team identity to underpin the highest levels of performance. Although at starkly different ends of the commercial sports world, both the European Ryder Cup team and the England women’s rugby team deliberately cultivated a shared sense of what it meant for each team to create history together. Europe knew they had to defy the odds to  , while   hadn’t won the World Cup since 2014, losing in the previous two finals. So what did these teams draw on to ensure they could bring their best game in those make or break moments? Performing under pressure at that level is not about training harder or putting the game‑face on. It’s not enough to be fuelled purely by individual, extrinsic drivers “to be the best”. That’s always there within an athlete’s psyche, but when you need to dig really deep – whether it’s facing a hostile environment at Bethpage Black, or Canada scoring first against you in the World Cup final at Twickenham’s Allianz Stadium. You need deep-rooted foundations to ground you, to hold your nerve and find your best performance, and to develop the instincts that help a team to achieve more together than they could alone. Rather than feel negatively pressured or weighed down by history as we have seen in the past, these athletes, captains, vice-captains and coaches respected, researched and embraced the history of their sports. They understood how the past, present and future would connect when they took to the field of play. And then they used this understanding to make sense of their unique responsibility to write the next chapter together, finding joy in the opportunity and privilege to do so. Behind the scenes in the Europe locker room, “This is our time, this is our place” was emblazoned on the wall, accompanied by names, jerseys and stories of those who had made their mark, focusing on the European   teams that had beaten the odds to win in the US. The dates of the four previous wins were written on the walls: 1987, 1995, 2004 and 2012 with the four shirts of those winning away teams hanging up. This wasn’t just about words, it was about jerseys worn and sweated in by their predecessors. Their shared challenge was to add one more shirt to the rail. A similarly profound history swirled around the Red Roses. The Trail of Roses installation at the London Eye celebrated every woman who had pulled on an England shirt, the pioneers and trailblazers on whose shoulders the current team knew they stood. This was a moment to show how far the women’s game had come since the first World Cup in 1991 and point to the immense future potential. Echoing the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team philosophy of taking care of the jersey before passing it on in better shape to the next player, these supremely talented golfers and rugby players drew on this sense of lineage to reach out and connect with their audiences. All the while, they gained perspective, meaning and humility for themselves, qualities that are key components of human resilience. Both teams set their ambitions far beyond winning. Luke Donald, the European captain, reaffirmed that they weren’t just playing to win, they were playing for each other, for all those who dreamed of playing for Europe in the future, for something far greater than themselves. Continuing to draw on the work with the performance coach Owen Eastwood that shaped his captaincy and team-building skills two years ago in Rome, Donald commissioned a moving video that featured many of the 37 European men who had won an away Ryder Cup, including current members of the team and himself – a powerful reinforcement of their overarching mission. Donald knew he needed to invest in both the data   the culture, the quantitative and the qualitative. One vice-captain, Edoardo Molinari, crunched the stats to inform pairings while another, José María Olazábal, captain from the last Europe team to win on foreign soil, brought past inspiration. Donald spent time listening to the players, figuring out how to prepare and set them up to thrive and play their best game at Bethpage Black: creating a shared purpose, connecting them to each other and then giving them autonomy to lead themselves once on the course. New Zealander John Mitchell, the Red Roses’ head coach, similarly prioritised culture-building since joining in 2023. The Red Roses emulated one of the core team strengths of England’s women footballers by ensuring the team spirit for those among the replacements felt as strong as those on the pitch. They also shared the Lionesses’   after the tournament through inspiring younger girls watching, the upcoming generation of players, as well as global rugby leaders to see the future potential of the sport. Both of these glorious sports teams have shown us that the true value of their sporting success lies in the depth of connection to their predecessors, those watching now and future generations to come. Developing a deep and deliberate historical consciousness is becoming a core part of how modern elite sports teams build resilient cultures to take their performance to the next level.", "tags": ["sport", "women's", "rugby", "world", "cup", "2025", "women's", "rugby", "union", "ryder", "cup", "2025", "rugby", "union", "golf", "ryder", "cup", "comment"]},

Hatton, who secured the half in the Sunday singles that  , has told home fans not to seek retribution in Ireland in two years’ time. “If it was my choice, and what I say isn’t really going to affect how people behave, I don’t really think that the insults are the way forward,” Hatton said. “Some guys on the team had it a lot worse than others. For me, there were a lot of insults maybe around height or hairline or weight, some of which I pretty much say to myself anyway, so it wasn’t like anything new. “But I would much prefer it to be a respectful atmosphere. You let the guys play and the best team wins – rather than trying to affect the outcome by trying to put off players or things like that. I don’t think it will be as hostile as maybe it was last week. I’d like to think that it will be very respectful.” The US captain, Keegan Bradley, who   at Bethpage, claimed behaviour at the New York course was no different to that in Rome two years ago, when Europe last hosted. Hatton, who went unbeaten for a second successive Ryder Cup, disagrees. “Personally I don’t think they were close at all,” the Englishman said. “Certainly with what I heard last week, I don’t think Rome comes anywhere near that. I think they are quite far apart.” The PGA of America chief executive, Derek Sprague, told the Golf Channel he intends to contact McIlroy in person to apologise for what he and his wife went through. “I do plan on sending them an email with my heartfelt apologies for what occurred,” Sprague said. “There’s no place for that in the   or in the game of golf. “I can’t wait to reach out to Rory and Erica and really, quite frankly, the entire European team. The whole European team should not have been subjected to that. And because of that, I feel badly and I plan on apologising to them. “When it [the Ryder Cup] started in 1927, it was about sportsmanship and integrity of the game, and that’s what we want it to be and continue to be and it’s unfortunate that people crossed the line last week.” However, Matt Fitzpatrick called out the organisation’s president, Don Rea, on Wednesday for his churlish reaction to the 15-13 home defeat at the trophy presentation. “I don’t want to speak on behalf of everyone but we did feel there was a little bit of bitterness when they presented the trophy,” Fitzpatrick said.

Fleetwood believes the job should be Donald’s if he wants it after back‑to‑back triumphs, but that Europe have a ready-made successor in his vice‑captain Francesco Molinari. “The ball is probably in Luke’s court and I think he’s earned that,” Fleetwood said. “I’ve spoken to Francesco about it numerous times.

The abuse was such that McIlroy began pushing back, telling one spectator to “shut the fuck up” during a foursomes match on Saturday morning. Rea also said when asked about the abuse hurled toward McIlroy: “I haven’t heard some of that. I’m sure it happened. It happens when we’re over in Rome on the other side, and Rory understands. Things like that are going to happen.” Europe’s Matt Fitzpatrick said about the Rome reference: “It’s pretty offensive to European fans the fact that he said that, really.” Shane Lowry said the level of abuse directed at McIlroy’s wife was “astonishing”. Derek Sprague, the chief executive at the PGA of America, said on Tuesday that spectators crossed the line and that he planned to apologise personally to Rory McIlroy and Erica McIlroy, who formerly worked at the PGA. “Rory might have been a target because of how good he is, but the entire European team should not have been subjected to that,” Sprague said on the   Channel. “I feel badly and I plan on apologising to them.” Rea also was criticised for an awkward trophy presentation in which he mentioned Europe had retained the cup, instead of winning it. On Tuesday, on his LinkedIn page, Rea wrote: “I’m personally taking some criticism right now and that comes with the role and just like when I was an umpire I expect it. However to the students and PGA members that follow me, know this, I am not bothered.” In Thursday’s letter, Rea was more contrite. “What makes our sport great is that we own our bogeys. We certainly own this one,” Rea wrote. “Our CEO Derek Sprague has apologised on our behalf to Erica and Rory McIlroy and to everyone with Ryder Cup Europe. “While it wasn’t my intention, some of my comments were seen in a negative light which reflects poorly on not only myself but also on the PGA of America and for that I truly apologise.” He ended the email, “God Bless and as always Go USA!” The PGA of America announced in 2013 it would bring the Ryder Cup to Bethpage Black, a public golf course on Long Island that had a reputation for fans targeting players with comments. Ted Bishop was the PGA president and Pete Bevacqua was the chief executive at the time of the announcement. Bishop was forced out as president in 2014, with a month left on his two-year term, for a social media post when he angrily referred to Ian Poulter as a “lil girl”.

They don’t go through enough national sporting despair. OK, they had an invigorating shot of misery last Sunday night losing the  , but that was a rare thing for them. It’s rare because they’re so dominant in all the team sports they really care about, not least because their biggest team sports – certainly NFL and baseball – aren’t played by anyone else. Or at least not to the extent that another nation is ever going to come close to beating them in any meaningful “world cup” competition. Basketball, to be fair, is widely played around the world but essentially the same applies – the US men have been Olympic champions 17 times out of 20; for the women it’s nine out of 12. Ice hockey is slightly different. Here, Americans haven’t had it all their own way, and in Canada have a genuine local rival. This may be one reason Trump makes noises about taking them over. So, why feel sorry for them? For a start, how diminished must be the joy of winning if you’re winning all the time? As a bloke with whom I go to the football always says after a miserable defeat: without despair there is no joy. Losing takes practice, which is why I can almost forgive the   of some of those Americans on the course over the weekend. They don’t know how to do it. So they just resort to nastiness. And worse, even after their team had performed brilliantly and nearly pulled off an incredible comeback, they were leaving in droves, storming out in a massive collective sulk. There didn’t seem to be any sticking around to applaud the worthy winners and, more importantly, salute their countrymen who, in the end, did themselves great credit in running Europe so close. Marching off towards the Long Island Railroad, it was like they were all channelling Vince Lombardi: “Show me a good loser,” the NFL coach famously said, “and I’ll show you a loser.” OK, point taken. But he was talking about the athletes rather than their fans. Americans don’t get the chance to come together in support of their national team in the way the rest of us do. It’s such a valuable thing for the people of a nation to go through together, opportunities to feel such unity and belonging being rather rare. And in the really big moments losing is just as valuable as winning, in the sense of all being in it together. The morning after one England final defeat I passed a mother and her young boy on their way to school. They happened to be of Indian heritage. The lad was wearing an England shirt. I made a sad face at the kid, and his mother’s look told me it had been a very difficult evening for the whole family. Me too. We’d all been through it together. The three of us and millions of others. OK, it wouldn’t have been the be-all and end-all for all 60-odd million of us, but it wasn’t nothing either. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all had their moments too, when everyone’s been pulling in the same direction and sharing the same feelings. In Croatia – the other country I care about – it’s been said to me that everyone disagrees with everyone else all the time about everything, until such time as the national football team walks on to the pitch for a big match. I’ve now watched England lose two European Championship finals, and Croatia lose in a World Cup final. On all three occasions I went home bloody miserable, but I’ve never felt more at one with my fellow country folk. Honestly, the Americans don’t know what they’re missing.

The crowd at the Bethpage Black course in New York graduated from boos and heckles to homophobic slurs and insults aimed at players’ wives. The first-tee master of ceremonies set the tone by leading a chant of “fuck you, Rory!”, putting Rory McIlroy firmly in the crosshairs – along with his wife, who was hit with a beer cup. After initially playing it down, American golf officials   and said some fan behaviour had “crossed the line”, but the affair has left a nagging sense of unease. What if the line has in fact moved? What if accepted codes of crowd behaviour have changed? It is a question social scientists and event managers have been asking in recent years and spans several countries and types of spectacle, obviating any sense that the issue is confined to US golf fans. Taunting banners brandished at football terraces, gum spat at tennis players, objects hurled on to concert stages, heckles during concerts – an apparently never-ending litany of boorish, loutish behaviour fills news feeds. “It’s undeniable that in all aspects of public life a growing number of people are becoming more belligerent,” said  , a University of Bristol cultural studies scholar. “It’s not just that people are becoming more badly behaved, it’s that when they’re called out, instead of simmering down they’re much more likely to turn against those making the complaint.” Last week the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre union (Bectu)   that showed 34% of those working in live events in the UK had experienced antisocial behaviour, violence, aggression or harassment from audience members in the past 12 months, with that figure rising to 77% for front-of-house staff. Some theorists of crowd psychology attribute aggression to “deindividuation”, whereby a sense of anonymity and sensory overload untether people from their sense of individual identity and they do things they ordinarily would not. Other theorists posit “convergence”, in which the crowd dynamic uncorks individuals’ inner beliefs and values. Either way, the results can be ugly. “Faggot!” some US fans screamed at McIlroy. “Wanker!” shouted others. Many commentators have linked such invective to toxic social media feeds and the climate of political polarisation, which suggests a modern phenomenon. But there is nothing new in sports fans or theatre audiences behaving badly. In ancient Athens, Plato complained about spectators becoming mobs, arguably making him the first theorist of crowd behaviour. Any gathering of humans, in fact, can cause upset. Thomas Hardy took the title of his novel Far From the Madding Crowd from Thomas Gray’s 1751 poem,  , that railed against the “ignoble strife” of those who disrupt “sacred calm”. Today’s anxiety over the coarsening of crowd behaviour can be overdone and is to some extent “moral panic”, said Sedgman. “Each society has golden-age thinking – looking back to a time when everyone was kind and courteous.” Some Scottish boxing fans still squirm over memories of a crowd booing Muhammad Ali during an exhibition bout at Paisley in 1965. “All booing must stop when the king’s in the ring,” he exhorted in vain. Eric Cantona took more direct action in 1995 when a Crystal Palace fan shouted “fuck off back to France you French motherfucker” by leaping over the barrier to  . Some experts question whether modern manners really have degraded. “The headlines tend to come from high-profile incidents: disorder at Wembley, gate-rushing at the Copa América final,” said Anne Marie Chebib, the chair of the UK Crowd Management Association ( ). “Yet the data tells us these are exceptions. The overwhelming majority of events take place safely and securely, with no disruption, but those stories rarely make the news.” In a 2023 poll of the association’s members, 93% reported deteriorating behaviour but the following year 57% reported no change or only a slight worsening, a pattern replicated in a   report. “Many practitioners now see behaviour as broadly stable,” said Chebib. , a University of St Andrews psychology professor and an authority on crowd behaviour, said there were perennial fears about the rowdiness and danger of crowds but that violence was extremely rare. Of 49 million attendances at British football matches last year, there were 1,963 arrests, of which half were disorder, he said. “You would likely get far more arrests if that many people of that demographic were in town of a Saturday afternoon. So you could argue that people are less likely to be disorderly and violent in a football crowd.” However, crowds make news only when there are disturbances, said Reicher. “You can have hundreds of games on a Saturday afternoon and violence at one. So which will be reported? And if we only see crowds when crowds are violent we get a highly distorted view of crowds as characteristically violent.” The Ryder Cup’s history and uniqueness suggest other reasons not to extrapolate too much from the scenes at Bethpage Black. The 1999 contest at Brookline, Massachusetts, was marred by abuse likened to a bear pit. McIlroy asked security officials to expel a particularly obnoxious heckler at Hazeltine in Minnesota in 2016. The tournament is structured around the US versus Europe at a time that Donald Trump is reconfiguring the meaning of Americanism, said Reicher. “It affirms the new world against the old. It is about triumphalism, about domination, about success by any means necessary. It rejects a rule-based order. It celebrates masculinity, domination excess. “The Ryder Cup shows the traction it is getting among at least some Americans. We cannot suppose from that it is relevant to all sports or even all golf.” Mark Breen, the strategic director of  , a company that advises on security, said swift action can shape crowd behaviour. “It’s about knocking bad norms on the head early, or establishing good ones,” he said. “Normal, decent people will get caught up in some behaviours so maybe you throw out the first hecklers, make an example of the worst offenders. But you don’t want to sterilise the sport, take the passion out of it.” Adding concerts and other events as adjuncts to sporting occasions complicates the balance, said Breen. “When you’re building a festival vibe, it’s harder to manage social norms. You just have to work as hard as you can to avoid boorishness.” John Drury, a social psychology professor at the University of Sussex, said music event organisers had reported deteriorating audience behaviour since the Covid pandemic, to the point it was now normalised. One possible explanation was that lockdown restrictions stunted socialisation, said Drury. “You’ve got a cohort of people that weren’t socialised by older generations when they’re going out, so they’re not used to it, and so perhaps don’t know what the norms are. What they’re doing feels right to them, but to other people it doesn’t feel right.” Another possible factor was audience members doing stunts to get attention on social media. In most cases it was just a tiny minority causing disruption, said Drury. “But these dramatic events are then presented as a kind of trend in audiences.” Sedgman has a more ominous analysis. Audience behaviour is a bellwether of wider societal trends and the apparent growth in loutishness, or lack of consideration, shows a fraying in the social contract, of the agreed norms that bind a society, she said. “An increasing number of people think they don’t need to follow these norms, that only mugs do so. It’s the canary in the coalmine.”  This article was amended on 6 October 2025.

The PGA of America chief executive, Derek Sprague, said he would apologise to McIlroy and the rest of the European team for the behaviour of the home fans. Morikawa, who lost two and halved one of his three matches at the tournament, agreed USA fans had gone too far but denied any personal responsibility. “I think we’ve taken what I said a little out of context. I think Ryder Cups are meant to have a lot of energy, right, and I think me saying the word ‘chaos’, I didn’t mean for them to be rude, right?” he said. “So like that’s not on me, I believe, for me to take credit for people being rude. I think what I meant was like I wanted energy, right? “You wanted people to be proud of the country, the countries they’re rooting for.

It will almost halve the already diminished aid pot, from 0.58% of national income to 0.3%. In 2023, the total aid spend was £15.34bn, almost a third of which was spent on supporting and housing refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. The last time Britain’s   was a quarter of a century ago, in 1999. Starmer’s move raised concerns among   and made migration more likely, and outraged humanitarians and aid agencies who warned of a “devastating” impact on the world’s poorest. It comes after President  , prompting warnings that lives would be lost in countries relying on US support. UK overseas aid has historically risen during Labour governments, most noticeably after Tony Blair came to power in 1997 with a pledge to meet the UN’s target of 0.7% of gross national income. The UN general assembly set the target in 1970 for developed countries to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on official development assistance (ODA), to promote the economic development and welfare of poorer nations. The Blair administration, with Gordon Brown as chancellor, set out to reverse a fall in aid spend, , over 18 years of Tory government. Blair set up the Department for International Development (DfID), to focus on reducing poverty, making aid more effective, improving the lives of women and girls and fighting climate change. Blair committed to achieve 0.7% by 2013.   and was met every year from 2013 to 2020. Other   target by 2015. In 2021, at the height of the Covid pandemic, then prime minister Boris Johnson said the economic impacts at home would result in a temporary reduction in ODA spend to 0.5% of GNI. The previous year, Johnson had controversially merged DfID with the Foreign Office.  The Starmer government had committed to restoring the 0.7% spend as soon as fiscal circumstances allowed. In 2023, official figures show the top three country recipients of bilateral aid were Ukraine (£250m), Ethiopia (£164m) and Afghanistan (£115m). Keir Starmer has said the UK will continue to support Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, as well as contribute to climate finance and global health. Regionally, the continent of Africa is the largest regional recipient of UK aid, at £1,229m. The UK’s ODA spend was  . Based on the most recent forecasts for GNI, reducing aid spend to  . Almost a third, 28% or £4.3bn, of aid went on support for refugees or asylum seekers in the UK or other donor countries in 2023, a dramatic rise from the 3.2%, or £400m, in 2020. Britain’s reported costs for each refugee or asylum seeker is many times that of other major European countries, due in part to a shortage of UK accommodation, leading to the Home Office housing people in hotels.  Humanitarian aid (15.3%) and health (13.3%) were the two largest sectors for bilateral aid in 2023, at £878m and £764m. Before the pandemic, humanitarian spending was about 15% to 16% of bilateral aid, but was reduced by half in 2021 after the pandemic, to 10.3%, from £1.3bn to £743m. In 2022 and 2023, the UK provided £592m to humanitarian crises in Ukraine, after the Russian invasion, and £467m to Afghanistan, after the Taliban takeover in 2021.

She knew straight away if a child would last the day; you learn such skills in a place where an infant dies  . Hanadi ran a small health centre in Zamzam, a sprawling displacement camp in Sudan’s Darfur region, the heart of the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe. Her clinic was already busy before breakfast on 11 April. But there was every chance it would get a lot busier. Outside Zamzam, the notorious Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group was massing on three sides, preparing for a possible ground assault. Some believed the RSF might hold off. Even for a group  , Zamzam, they felt, was too soft a target. Its 500,000 residents – predominantly women and children – were virtually defenceless. They were also starving to death. “Inside Zamzam you’d find one of – if not   – most vulnerable populations on the planet,” says a UN war crimes investigator, requesting anonymity. Even so, soon after 8am heavy artillery jolted Zamzam. Drones buzzed above. The offensive had begun. Attacking on multiple fronts, RSF units breached the camp’s defensive berm. Near its southern entrance, up to 50 teenage girls sat staring at their phones. Witnesses saw them being bundled into RSF pickup trucks, and driven away. None have been seen since. Two hundred metres east, 30 RSF pickups entered Ahmadai neighbourhood. Sixty homes belonging to the ethnic Zaghawa tribe were set ablaze. Women were shot as they fled. Six stayed, and burned alive as a consequence. Five minutes north of Ahmadai, Fatima Bakhit was lying beside her husband, two sons and her uncle, who was blind. Through a fence, the pregnant 25-year-old could peer into the courtyard of Zamzam’s last functioning international clinic, run by  . Four RSF Toyota Hiluxes smashed through the gate to the clinic’s compound. Bakhit watched the medics scramble into two foxholes, the subterranean hideaways residents had dug to survive artillery attacks. Five staff squeezed inside one, four into the other. “Come out,   [slaves]!” shouted a fighter. A doctor, injured by shelling, emerged. He was shot in the stomach and tumbled back into the foxhole, wounded but alive. Two more shots. “The others were told to lie on their backs. They were killed,” says Hafiza*, another witness. The occupants of the second foxhole were lined up at gunpoint. They too were executed. Bakhit’s husband was shot dead. More gunfire followed. Her five-year-old son was struck in the back. “Parts of his body fell in my hand,” says Bakhit. Her other son, aged three, crawled towards her, spattered red with the blood of his dead brother. Bakhit was shot in the right leg and hand. “Hey! I told you not to shoot women and children,” yelled an RSF officer. He turned to Bakhit. “Your men are   Stand up!” Bakhit’s blind uncle stumbled. He was killed. The RSF entered the Sheikh Farah Quranic school next door to the clinic. It was packed with students and residents seeking shelter. Among them was Sumaya Adam. “We hid, but the attackers dragged the men out.” Bakhit watched at least 15 children and men being led outside. “They got them standing in line and shot them all dead.” The killing spree, by turns methodical and frenzied, would last another 70 hours. Until now, what unfolded at Zamzam has largely remained a mystery: many of those who witnessed the atrocities were killed. However, testimony from scores of survivors along with intelligence and UN sources offers an intricate insight into one of the most shocking episodes of Sudan’s  . Pieced together, the accounts portray an ethnic slaughter of such magnitude that the Zamzam attack is likely to have been the second biggest war crime of Sudan’s catastrophic conflict, behind a   in West Darfur nearly two years earlier. Official estimates indicate up to 400 people were killed in Zamzam. A committee set up to investigate the true number has so far identified more than 1,500 deaths. Committee member Mohammed Sharif says the final figure will be significantly higher: hundreds are yet to be accounted for. A Darfur atrocity expert who has interviewed scores of Zamzam survivors is “certain” more than 2,000 died. But the RSF wanted one resident dead more than any other. From the start, paramilitaries identified Hanadi as a priority target. Senior RSF figures were incensed by footage of the young nurse beseeching Zamzam’s residents to stand their ground. An extraordinary plot involving undercover agents, bribes and plain-clothed assassins had been hatched to silence her. “They hate women,” said Manahel, a friend. “Especially ones that stand up to them.” At about the moment that the staff at Relief International were executed, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) forwarded details of a press briefing about a forthcoming conference. In four days’ time, on 15 April, nearby Lancaster House would host a global summit aimed at bringing peace to Sudan. The date was seared on the Sudanese psyche: the   of the war between the military and RSF that had   their country. The briefing made no reference to the nightmare evolving in Zamzam. Yet real-time updates were already provoking panic among Sudan’s diaspora. UK officials began receiving “atrocity alerts”. Two days before the Zamzam offensive, sources say the UN security council was briefed that a large-scale assault on the camp was imminent. A month earlier, analysts from   had told the council in person that Zamzam was at risk, one of five face-to-face warnings it shared in 2025. , at Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab, says: “We made concerted efforts to warn the international community that a full-scale assault on Zamzam was both imminent and inevitable.” Less than 24 hours before the attack, sources say FCDO officials were taken aside by concerned experts at an event at the Chatham House research institute in London and told of fears of an impending ethnic massacre at Zamzam. An attack on Sudan’s largest displacement camp was the scenario everybody dreaded. Two decades earlier, it had been conceived as a haven for the ethnic African tribes being slaughtered by Arab militias – the same militias that would become the RSF. Few Darfuri families had avoided the genocidal violence that  . Born the year the   began, Hanadi chose nursing because of the suffering she saw as a child. The violence has rarely subsided since. Zamzam expanded with each spasm of fighting. Now 4 miles (7km) long, its proportions did not prevent it being surrounded by the RSF. Besieged since June 2024, food was beyond scarce. Residents were forced to eat leaves to survive. In August that year, famine was  . “There was a moral obligation for the London conference to  ,” says a UN source. There was, however, a complication. Among the 20 countries invited to the conference was the UAE, one of the west’s most coveted economic partners. Although the UAE “firmly rejects any claims of providing arms or military equipment” to the RSF, allegations to the contrary are  . Critics allege it is plausible that weaponry linked to the Gulf state was used at Zamzam. The UAE says the claims are unfounded. Campaigners, though, sensed a unique opportunity. The timing of the assault, on the eve of the London conference, would surely persuade the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to call out the UAE. “Lammy could have used his leverage to tell his Emirati counterpart to cancel the outrageous attack on a displacement camp: ‘If you don’t, you are not invited to London,’” says a UN expert. Such a warning would have had merit. Sources reveal Emirati officials are in “constant contact” with the  , among others. Sources, in fact, reveal the UAE had already moved to prevent another massacre. Sources say in June 2024, Abu Dhabi called Hemedti and “told him to stop” a planned assault on El Fasher, after the UN security council introduced a   demanding the RSF cease fighting around Zamzam and El Fasher, the neighbouring city. No attack happened. In Sudan, the RSF continued to push deeper into Zamzam. House to house searches were carried out. Occupants were summarily executed. Tayseer Abdalla saw two of her aunts and their young daughters killed inside their home near the central market. Mariam watched the militia enter her sister’s house. “They dragged her out and killed her. They slaughtered us like animals,” she says. Ruqayyah and her family were leaving when the RSF entered their home. Wordlessly, they opened fire. Ruqayyah was able to limp away. Three others were left to die. Meanwhile, across south Zamzam, RSF fighters offered bribes for clues to Hanadi’s whereabouts. “They were offering huge amounts,” says Ismail Idris, a relative who lives in the British town of Reading. Kaltouma, another camp resident, describes the fighters arriving at her door. “They were shouting: ‘Where is she? Where is she?’” For all the efforts to locate her, Hanadi was often directly in front of them. “She was present on the frontlines, treating, bandaging,” says friend Mohamed Afandy. The casualties mounted. Defended by a ragtag mix of volunteer resistance units and   – whose remit was to protect civilians – the camp was hopelessly outgunned and outnumbered. About 200 RSF pickups had attacked Zamzam, seven times the number defending it. By midday, the RSF had crossed the B26 highway, entering the main camp. A call had gone out for civilians to defend Zamzam. “Hanadi was among the first to answer,” says Muhammad Effendi, a resident. Hanadi headed to the frontline armed with a modest kitchen knife. Up against hi-tech drones and guided bombs, Hanadi’s father, Juma, says her unit repelled at least one attack. By early afternoon, Hanadi’s unit was pinned down near the central market. Witnesses describe the nurse laying down her knife to tend to the wounded. Mohammed Sharif, 27, ran past her position under ferocious fire. “I saw her saving injured people, giving them medicine.” Hope rested with a sizeable Sudanese military garrison seven miles away in El Fasher. If soldiers were sent, Zamzam would be saved. “We were waiting for support from El Fasher but didn’t get it. We still don’t know why,” says Mohamed Adam, a teacher. The central market was not the only place under pressure. Mustafa Bora saw RSF fighters heading for the camp’s community kitchen. Bora sprinted there, imploring everyone to evacuate. Hasanat Musa – seven months pregnant – and her friend, Nana Idris, refused to budge. “Why are you cooking for slaves?” asked fighters as they stormed the kitchen, smashing pots. Musa’s late-stage pregnancy offered no protection. She and Idris were executed. The attackers closed in on Hanadi’s new position: a makeshift health centre north of the market. Hisham Mohamed was fighting alongside her. “She told us: ‘Die with honour. I will be here until the end.’” Hanadi may not have noticed the men approaching. Only when alongside her did they reveal their weapons. She was shot at close range. “Their operatives infiltrated the camp disguised in civilian clothing to carry out her assassination,” says Juma. Chaotic footage shows her being carried by friends to another rudimentary clinic. A soundtrack of gunfire is constant. By now, much of Zamzam was hurrying north. Shells fell on fleeing families. RSF snipers climbed trees, picking them off. Mariam witnessed children flattened by a shell as they fled. “Nobody will ever bury them,” she says. Others described leaping over body parts. Bleeding children lay waiting for help that never came. Hundreds hid underground in cramped, sweltering foxholes. “They were quickly filled with women and children,” says one witness, Adouma Ali. RSF death squads combed the area. Anyone found in a foxhole was shot. Further south, Bakhit lay frozen beside her dead husband and child. At 3pm a neighbour attempted to reach her but was shot in the hip. Darkness fell. The RSF retreated. “Suddenly it was quiet. People emerged from foxholes, shellshocked,” says Ali. As the cacophony of gunfire subsided, children could be heard crying in the dark. Next, the scraping of shovels as bodies were placed in shallow graves. Bakhit laid her five-year-old son and husband in an enlarged foxhole. In Zamzam’s southern neighbourhoods, the night brought terror. Fighters wandered devastated streets, looking for women to abduct. In Hamaday and Karaba districts, they began raping. Elsewhere, residents headed towards Saloma, Zamzam’s northern neighbourhood. Many passed the makeshift clinic where volunteers were battling to save Hanadi. Back in London, as night fell, the mood among humanitarians was febrile. Attempts to cajole FCDO officials into making a statement on Zamzam ahead of the conference had foundered. “Everybody was raging, asking: ‘Where’s Lammy?’” recalls a prominent human rights expert. They could not even pressure Sudanese diplomats attending the conference: none had been invited. Details of the atrocities, delivered to western policymakers, were politely dismissed. “Evidence of genocide was met with: ‘Thank you for sharing. Keep us updated,’” says a prominent humanitarian. Although the UK is “ ” on Sudan – meaning it leads the UN security council’s activities on Africa’s third-largest country – nothing happened. Many felt the timing of the offensive before the conference was deliberate. “It was beyond provocative. The RSF – and its alleged backers, the UAE – were saying: “Go on, let’s see what you can do,” says the UN investigator. Zamzam shuddered again under a ferocious artillery bombardment. One resident counted 250 shells. Tens of thousands of residents began moving towards Saloma. Leaving her home in Jafalo, Nafisa encountered devastation. “I saw 18 dead bodies, including a child killed by shelling.” Drones targeted main roads. At 11am, Bora saw a girl staggering around Labado neighbourhood. Shrapnel had speared her face. She had lost an eye. Qismah, an aid worker, watched adolescent fighters targeting whoever they came across. “They didn’t even try to communicate. They just shot at anyone.” Across Zamzam, a huge game of cat and mouse unfolded. Jamal, a health worker, and his family were near the almost deserted   when RSF fighters approached. Jamal ran into a house, joining 50 other people hiding inside alongside a flock of sheep. He peered into the street. Residents were being dragged outside. “I saw them kill six civilians; five young men and someone over 80 years old.” The RSF came closer. More shots reverberated outside. The door swung open. “They entered, saw the sheep, took them and forgot who was in the house. But they were killing anyone, even children. My cousin was killed that way,” says Jamal. Some people headed east, seeking refuge in a nearby valley. Halima and her three children ran there, pursued by RSF pickups. They had no chance. “Before they spoke, they shot my 16-year-old son in the head. I attacked the person who fired, but four men grabbed me: two by the legs, two by the hands. The man who killed my son raped me,” says Halima. Then they raped her teenage daughters. “I could hear their screams, especially my youngest, who was 13. After an hour and a half, [the RSF] left.” Halima laid clothes over her dead son. She carried her youngest daughter, who could not stand, to Saloma. Some crimes were thwarted by women who, inspired by Hanadi, had joined self-defence units. Fatima Ramadan was being pursued by the RSF when self-defence recruits “no older than girls” intervened. “The girls gave us advice and guidance on how to get out.” By mid afternoon, the central market was ablaze. Bleaker news followed: attempts to save Hanadi had proved futile. At about 3pm, the nurse was buried in a secret location to prevent the RSF desecrating her body. Ammunition, fuel and food supplies were perilously low. Joint forces commanders told relatives they were contemplating a full withdrawal. Reports began to surface of children being executed. In one account, RSF had converged on a straw hut in west Zamzam. Several infants were hidden inside. Fighters stood in the doorway and “opened fire on the children”. Nightfall prompted a procession of people to move silently towards Saloma. The joint forces retreated to El Fasher. The failure of the Sudanese army to help Zamzam hurt. One theory suggests the military sat back and allowed the RSF to rampage, assuming the politicians gathering in London would have little choice but to censure the militia and its Gulf ally. The weekend began with the firm expectation Lammy would issue an early, robust statement on Zamzam. WhatsApp exchanges between atrocity experts and FCDO officials urged the foreign secretary to act. Although officials “acknowledged” the dire situation in Darfur, for the first time humanitarians began to think that they might do nothing about it. “Zamzam obviously framed the conference. Were they deliberately trying to ignore it?” says a source in frequent contact with Lammy’s advisers. As the hours ticked by, and the litany of RSF brutalities grew ever longer, a decision was seemingly made by the UK government to say nothing. No emergency meeting was convened; no face-to-face with groups collating evidence of war crimes from Zamzam. Repeatedly, officials were told they risked ignoring possible genocide. Messages between advisers to the UN security council compared the attack to  , where more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were slaughtered by Bosnian Serb forces in 1995. Did Lammy pressure his Emirati counterpart over Zamzam? Did he even raise Zamzam? The FCDO declined to comment. “Ultimately – by pen and by sword – the RSF was doing its thing in Zamzam while the UAE did its thing in London. Both components were working to keep a genocidal project going,” says a prominent human rights analyst. Tempers flared. “At one point officials felt the burgeoning atrocity wasn’t worth contacting Lammy for,” the analyst claims. The UAE told the Guardian: “We categorically reject any claims of providing any form of support to either warring party since the onset of the civil war.” At a time delayed for colleagues in the US, campaigners met online to strategise how to challenge the inertia. Journalists received details of “genocidal” violence. Darkness came with no response from the UK. Similarly, no emergency UN security council meeting had been called. Those monitoring the atrocities in Zamzam from London were consumed with helplessness. “Help! This is hell!” read one WhatsApp message. Then, something: Lammy sent a tweet. “Shocking reports” from Darfur, he wrote, giving impetus to the impending conference. “All sides must commit to the protection of civilians.” Daybreak saw thousands huddled around Saloma Square, northern Zamzam. Hundreds more squeezed inside the grand mosque for protection. Shortly after 8am, RSF fighters flooded the square. Those sheltering inside the mosque were ordered out. “The RSF began dividing people based on their ethnic groups and physical strength. They started with young men,” says Ibrahim. The men were told to stand in line. It is not known how many were massacred. “A large number were executed by gunfire,” says Ibrahim. Elderly men and women were split into groups. Individuals identified as Zaghawa and linked to the joint forces were, he says, brutally beaten. Community leaders and teachers were humiliated. Unrestrained violence was reserved for another young nurse, called Mihrab. Upon finding surgical gloves in her bag, she was beaten repeatedly for treating  . Women and children, say witnesses, were separated based on physicality; those deemed sufficiently sturdy were forced to walk livestock to Kabkabiya, 105 miles away. Testimony then describes eight shells thumping into Saloma Square. Fighters charged the crowd from east and west. Amid the pandemonium, Bakhit lost her three-year-old. Panicking, she limped south to find him. Bodies littered the landscape. “Vehicles smelt, bodies were still inside,” says Bakhit. “An RSF commander said: ‘Throw those bodies in the   [creek].’” Satellite images confirm widespread destruction. As Zamzam burned, RSF units started shelling El Fasher. The camp was now in full retreat. At 1.45pm the   received a message from colleagues in Darfur. “Zamzam under the control of the RSF,” it read. Women trapped in the camp became increasingly vulnerable. At least eight were raped that afternoon. Others were abducted. Eleven were reportedly trafficked 19 miles south. Families were asked to pay a ransom equivalent to £6,000 for their release. Back in Saloma, gigantic crowds were hemmed in by the RSF. “Severe shortages of food and water led to the deaths of many children,” says Jamal Abdullah, a teacher. When eventually allowed to leave, more than   fled Zamzam. Tens of thousands walked 30 miles to Tawila. Among them was Hanadi’s family. It was a hellish journey. Women and girls were raped at checkpoints. Men walked away from the road to avoid execution. But the main killer was starvation or thirst. Sources estimate hundreds may have died making the journey. Ethnic prejudices underscored the enmity. Marchers were asked in Zaghawa: “How are you?” Anyone who responded was beaten. Bakhit, unable to find her toddler in Zamzam, joined the throng to Tawila. She felt numb. “I had lost my husband, my children. I felt nothing. Not even hunger.” Multiple accounts, though, detail extraordinary acts of kindness: thousands of children and elderly people were carried by strangers. By most metrics the London conference on Sudan flopped, torpedoed by bickering between the Emiratis and opposing Arab states. The concluding conference   ignored Darfur’s horror. Zamzam was not even mentioned. “It was like they pretended it never happened,” says a UN source. UK officials say the conference “substantively advanced international coherence” on Sudan. Lammy did not dedicate 15 April to Sudan, finding time to secretly meet his Israeli counterpart. The FCDO would not say for how long, why or where the meeting occurred. “Why wasn’t every diary slot that day devoted to civilian protection in Sudan?” says a diplomat. The conference also sidelined the most important group in Sudan: its women. Hala Al-Karib of the  says: “Sudanese women form the backbone of their communities. They smuggle food and medicine, risking their lives. Yet we have no presence in policy and political settings.” Abdallah Abugarda, of the UK’s Darfur Diaspora Association, believes Zamzam proves the UK chose the Emirates’ economic muscle over human rights. Of 30,000 Darfuris in his organisation, he says 4,500 know a friend or relative killed in the attack. Leeds-based Suleiman Yousif lost eight family members. “They were murdered together in one location,” he says. On 17 April, as the enormity of the massacre started to become clear, the UN security council   “repeated attacks” on Zamzam. A week later, Lammy   a statement, saying the attack carried the “hallmarks of ethnic cleansing”. He has released no official statement on Sudan since then. An FCDO spokesperson, referring to the Zamzam attacks as “abhorrent”, said: “The UK and foreign secretary are at the forefront of efforts to keep the conflict on the international agenda.” Already the slaughter feels like a footnote. An all-party parliamentary meeting on Sudan after the offensive provoked dismay. “None of the speakers mentioned what happened in Zamzam,” says Abugardh. A subsequent request to hold a special session on the attack was, he claims, rejected. Meanwhile, an unpublished UN report on atrocities in Sudan contains, say sources, “half a line reference to what occurred at Zamzam”. Thirty-seven days after Zamzam fell, the UK declared its desire for a   with the Emirates. Back in Darfur, Hanadi is still celebrated. Her killers, however, will probably never face justice. Her former home stands largely deserted: Hanadi’s family are split between Tawila, Chad and their original North Darfur village. UN investigators believe such “deliberate displacement” was the motive for the attack. Others believe Zamzam was ransacked so the RSF could pay fighters. Residents are adamant the attackers wanted to “exterminate” them. Sporadically, cheering news comes from Darfur. After 18 days trawling Tawila for her toddler, a chance encounter with an injured woman revealed Bakhit’s son was safe, 12 miles away in Shagra. They were reunited in May. But another ethnic slaughter is looming. El Fasher – with a population of over a million – is surrounded, starving and under attack from the RSF. As the fighting intensifies, new heroes like Hanadi will inevitably emerge. They, too, will be buried in secret graves, legends in a war with no end. * ", "tags": ["global", "development", "sudan", "conflict", "and", "arms", "internally", "displaced", "people", "war", "crimes", "david", "lammy", "africa", "features"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/22/food-aid-gaza-deaths-visual-story-ghf-israel", "content": "aed Jamal sends the message shortly after he returns, empty-handed, from an aid distribution point to his tent in the al-Mawasi displacement camp in south-west  . “The tanks came and started firing. Three boys near me were martyred,” says the 36-year-old, who has four children. “I didn’t even get anything, just two empty boxes.” Jamal’s journey involved a long walk to and from a former residential neighbourhood bulldozed by Israeli forces and turned into one of four militarised aid distribution centres run by the   Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is based in Delaware in the US. The GHF sites – Tal al-Sultan, Saudi neighbourhood, Khan Younis and Wadi Gaza – are located in evacuation zones, which means civilians seeking food have to enter areas they have been ordered to leave. According to GHF’s Facebook page, the sites remain open for as little as eight minutes at a time, and in June the average for the Saudi site was 11 minutes. These factors have led to accusations from NGOs that the system is dangerous by design. The Unrwa chief, Philippe Lazzarini,   “the so-called mechanism … is a death trap costing more lives than it saves.” The system favours the strongest, so it is mostly men who travel along the designated routes. Then they wait – often for hours – for a centre to open. Finally, there is a dash into the centre of the zones and a scramble to grab a box. At every stage, those seeking aid pass Israeli tanks and troops, as quadcopters fly above. In another clip shared by Jamal he ducks as bullets pass overhead. “We have purged our hearts of fear,” Jamal says of his near daily walks to the site. “I need to bring food for my children so they don’t die of hunger.” GHF, a startup organisation with no experience of distributing food in complex conflict zones, employs US mercenaries at the sites, which opened in May. They replaced 400 non-militarised aid points run under a UN system that Israel claimed had to be shut down because Hamas was diverting aid from it. No evidence for this has been provided. Since May,   from the centres and other humanitarian convoys, according to the UN. The sites’ opening times are usually announced in posts on a   and, more recently, messages sent through a Telegram channel. A WhatsApp channel was also set up in the first weeks. People have been warned not to approach the centres until they open. As the chart below shows, for the site Jamal visited, the amount of time between the site’s opening time being announced and the opening itself decreased dramatically in June. Mahmoud Alareer, a 27-year-old living in a tent in western Gaza City, says the opening time announcements for the aid site he uses – Wadi Gaza – have become useless, because of the distance from where he is living. Instead, he travels to the edges of the site in the middle of the night and gambles on it opening at 2am, as it has on every visit so far. First he climbs on to the back of a truck for the long ride south from Gaza City through the militarised Netzarim corridor. Then he waits in the dark until Israeli forces allow him to enter. “You get there and you slowly, slowly advance,” he says. “You always know that it could be you who gets shot, or it might be someone next to you.” Alareer says chaos always ensues when the aid point opens, as people start running towards the packages, which are left in the middle of the distribution zone. People trip over craters and tangled wires. GHF has faced severe criticism from the humanitarian community due to the dangers posed to Palestinians both at the sites and on the roads around them. In early July,  , accusing it of violating the principles of humanitarian aid, and calling for the resumption of non-militarised aid in Gaza. Médecins Sans Frontières’ (MSF) emergency coordinator in Gaza, Aitor Zabalgogeazkoa, says night-time distributions are particularly dangerous because so many roads in southern Gaza have been made unrecognisable by Israeli bombing, making it hard for Palestinians to stick to routes designated by GHF. Zabalgogeazkoa is scathing about the GHF system. “This is not humanitarian aid,” he says. “We can only think that it was designed to cause damage to the people seeking aid.” A GHF spokesperson denied that their system was unsafe, claiming that the danger was outside their distribution zones. They also accused the UN of using “exaggerated” casualty figures. The IDF have been contacted for comment. GHF has previously defended its operations and accused its critics of engaging in a “turf war” over humanitarian supplies. It says it bears no responsibility for deaths outside the perimeters of its sites. The Israeli military   at Palestinians who it says have approached its forces in a suspicious manner. It has also disputed some of the death tolls provided by the Palestinian authorities. GHF runs only four sites to feed 2 million people, in a territory where extreme hunger is widespread and  . According to figures released by Gaza’s health ministry 33 people have died due to starvation and malnutrition since Sunday. It says it has delivered more than 85 million meals “ ” since its operations began. According to these figures, each box would provide a family with about 60 meals. The organisation has posted photos of GHF-marked boxes that have items such as flour, potatoes, beans and oil. However, Palestinians in Gaza have shared pictures showing open boxes at GHF sites containing a smaller range of items. Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, says she could not comment on the specific logistics of GHF, but that aid should go beyond food and should include water, cooking gas or other cooking facilities. “If you look at Gaza now … people have been deprived of everything that sustains life: shelter materials, fuel, cooking gas, hygiene materials, everything that one needs to feel dignified, to have some sort of semblance of normality,” she says.  (WFP), nearly a third of Gaza’s population is going several days without food, and 470,000 people are expected to face the most severe levels of hunger between May and September this year. The WFP has also warned that dietary diversity declined sharply in May and continued to worsen in June. Damage to farmland over the course of the war has only increased Palestinians’ reliance on aid. A study published this year using satellite imagery to assess damage to farmland found  . A Unosat assessment from April found that  . This sequence shows damage to greenhouses and orchards in Beit Lahiya. In late March, dozens of bakeries supported by the WFP halted production due to the Israeli blockade. A handful briefly resumed bread production in May when some trucks were allowed into the territory, as this timeline shows. Jamal reiterates that he has no choice but to return to his nearest GHF site, despite the dangers. “I have gone four days in a row and not brought anything back, not even flour – nothing,” he says. “Sometimes you just can’t beat the others. But what else can we do, our life is a struggle.”  This article was amended on 22 July 2025. An earlier version said the price of flour in Gaza had risen by 31 May to $420 per kg.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/09/what-is-gender-apartheid-activists-international-law-women-girls-rights-afghanistan-iran", "content": "Over the past three years, the world has watched in horror as women and girls in   have had their rights and freedoms systematically stripped away. In the face of inaction by the international community, a campaign for the conditions being imposed on Afghan and Iranian women to be made a crime under international law as gender apartheid was launched last year. What does the term mean and will it make a difference? Gender apartheid is a term used to describe the systemic oppression, discrimination and segregation of a specific group based on gender. Apartheid is   as “inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them”. Racial apartheid, which comes from the Afrikaans word for “separateness”,   under international law in 1973 in response to the segregation and subjugation of black South Africans by the white ruling class in South Africa since 1948, and which continued until 1994. Women’s rights activists, UN experts and lawyers argue that if you replace the word “racial” with “gender”, it becomes an accurate reflection of the condition of tens of millions of women and girls in Afghanistan and Iran. At the end of 2023, a campaign called   was launched by Afghan human rights activists, backed by United Nations experts, calling for gender apartheid in Afghanistan to be codified as a crime against humanity by the U The campaign argues that current laws   do not reflect the intent, ideology and institutionalised nature of the systemic subjugation and deprivation of women in Afghanistan , where laws have been specifically crafted to constrain the lives of women and their role in society. Women and their status and rights have been pivotal to the Taliban’s governance of Afghanistan since it swept to power in August 2021, after the withdrawal of US and UK troops and the collapse of the democratic Afghan government. In the past three years, the group has issued more than   curtailing the rights of all Afghanistan’s women and girls. The Taliban have   and university, banned women from almost every form of paid employment, prevented them from  , attending gyms or   and blocked their access to the legal system. In August, they published a new set of “ , which banned women from speaking in public, deeming their voices an “intimate” part of their bodies, and made it mandatory for women to cover every part of their body in thick cloth in public. It also made it illegal for women to look at a man who is not a relation. The Taliban have also brought back flogging and the   and public execution of women for offences such as adultery. Some human rights activists are also arguing that the term gender apartheid should also be applied to what is happening to women in Iran. They argue that Iran’s new “hijab and chastity” bill imposes harsh penalties, including prison sentences of up to 10 years, on women who do not conform to a mandated dress code and head covering in public. It also increases the surveillance of women and girls by the government to ensure they are conforming to the hijab regulations, using   and government-mandated “hijab watchers” and imposes more gender segregation in public spaces. An aggressive enforcement crackdown by the Iranian regime has seen    ,   and imprisoned after being deemed to be in breach of strict hijab laws The UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran has called the law  , and said “authorities appear to be governing through systemic discrimination with the intention of suppressing women and girls into total submission” However, others argue that the situation for women in Iran is not comparable to the plight of women in Afghanistan and while the Iranian authorities are undeniably imposing human rights abuses and severe gender discrimination on women and girls, it does not equate to gender apartheid. Those calling for gender apartheid to be recognised as a crime against humanity argue that the international community responded to racial apartheid in South Africa after it became a crime in 1973,eventually forcing the government to back down. If gender apartheid was codified as a crime and applied to Afghanistan or Iran, states would theoretically be obliged to take action, to uphold the integrity of international laws. It would also increase pressure on countries to grant asylum to Afghan and Iranian women and girls and hopefully stop states from accepting the legitimacy of Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan and pursuing trade and diplomatic relations with them. In September, Canada, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands said it was planning to take the   to the international court of justice (ICJ) for gender discrimination, which could strengthen the calls to codify gender apartheid under international law. However, others argue that making gender apartheid a crime would have limited impact. When it comes to Afghanistan, while activists push for sanctions and isolation of the Taliban, the international community has largely followed a policy of conditional engagement and there are signs that countries in the region are slowly building diplomatic bridges with the regime. So far, no condemnation, sanctions or pressure from the international community has had any impact on the Taliban or the relentless oppression of women and girls in Iran and there is no prospect of governments engaging militarily in Afghanistan or Iran to protect their rights.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/02/are-we-ready-for-another-pandemic", "content": "Five years ago, the world was hearing the first reports of a mysterious flu-like illness emerging from Wuhan, China, now known as Covid-19. The pandemic that followed brought  , and sent   through the world economy. About   worldwide have had long Covid. World leaders, recognising that another pandemic was not a question of “if” but “when”, promised   to strengthen global health systems. But negotiations on a new pandemic agreement stalled in 2024, even as   global public health threats and emergencies were identified. If a new pandemic threat emerges in 2025, experts are yet to be convinced that we will deal with it any better than the last. While experts agree that another pandemic is inevitable, exactly what, where and when is impossible to predict. New health threats emerge frequently. World health leaders   an outbreak of mpox in Africa an international public health emergency in 2024. As the year ended, teams of specialists were   of an unknown illness in a remote area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, now thought to be cases of severe malaria and other diseases  . Maria van Kerkhove, interim director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention at the World Health Organization (WHO), is concerned about   – the virus is not spreading human to human but there have been an increasing number of human infections in the past year. While there is a well-established international monitoring system specifically focused on influenza, surveillance in sectors such as trade and agriculture, where humans and animals mix, is not comprehensive enough, she says. And she stresses that the ability to properly assess the risk “depends on the detection, the sequencing, the transparency of countries to share those samples”. The Covid-19 pandemic left health systems worldwide “really shaky” and has been followed by a long list of other health crises, she says. “Seasonal influenza started circulating, we had an mpox emergency, we’ve had  , we’ve had cholera, we’ve had earthquakes, we’ve had floods, measles, diphtheria, dengue,  . Health systems are really buckling under the weight and our health workforce globally has really taken a beating. Many have left. Many are suffering from PTSD. Many died.” What keeps her up at night, she says, is “complacency”, worrying that the response to a new threat will be hampered by “the notion that ‘it’ll just go away’, or ‘it’ll burn itself out’”. The world has never been in a better position when it comes to the expertise, technology and data systems to rapidly detect a threat, Van Kerkhove says. The expansion of genomic sequencing abilities to most countries worldwide, and better access to medical oxygen and infection prevention and control, remain “really big gains” after the Covid-19 pandemic, she adds. It means her answer to whether the world is ready for the next pandemic “is both yes and no”. “On the other hand, I think the difficulties and the trauma that we’ve all gone through with Covid and with other outbreaks, in the context of war and climate change and economic crises and politics, we are absolutely not ready to handle another pandemic,” she says. “The world doesn’t want to hear me on television saying that the next crisis is upon us.” The world of public health is “fighting for political attention, for fiscal space, for investment” – rather than nations working to stay in “a steady state of readiness”, she says. The long-term solution, she says, is “about getting that level of investment right. It’s about getting that sense of urgency correct. It’s about making sure that the system isn’t fragile.” Rwanda’s minister of health, Dr Sabin Nsanzimana, found himself dealing with two major disease outbreaks in 2024: Africa’s mpox public health emergency, and   of Marburg virus in his own country. He also co-chairs the governing board of the  , set up in November 2022 as a financing mechanism to help poorer countries prepare for emerging pandemic threats. If the next pandemic arrives in 2025, he warns: “Sadly, no, the world is not ready. Since the Covid public health emergency ended last year, too many political leaders have turned their attention and resources toward other challenges. We are entering once again what we call the cycle of neglect. People are forgetting just how costly the pandemic was to human lives and to economies and are failing to heed its lessons.” He says the Pandemic Fund “urgently needs more resources to fulfil its mission” – it has received requests from low- and middle-income countries totalling $7bn (£5.6bn) to fund pandemic preparation and response investments, against $850m available. In 2022 the WHO began negotiations for a new pandemic accord that would provide a firm basis for future international cooperation. But talks failed to yield a result by an initial deadline of the annual World Health Assembly in May 2024. Negotiators are now aiming for a deadline of  . So far the talks have actually worsened trust levels between countries, says Dr Clare Wenham of the department of health policy at LSE. There is no agreement on what Wenham calls “the big elephant in the room” of “pathogen access and benefit sharing” – essentially, what guarantees poorer countries are given that they will have access to treatments and vaccines against a future pandemic disease, in exchange for providing samples and data that allow those therapies to be created.   suggests more equal vaccine access during the Covid-19 pandemic could have saved more than a million lives. “[Governments] are just so far apart, and no one is really willing to budge,” says Wenham, with only 10 days of actual negotiating time scheduled before the World Health Assembly deadline. Practical questions remain about the feasibility of what is being proposed, she adds, “even if you get over the fundamentals of how unwilling governments are to compromise”. Her assessment is blunt: “We’ve had the biggest pandemic of our lifetimes, and we’re worse prepared than we were when we went in.” She is among commentators who fear that any accord pushed through in May will lack real teeth, agreeing only a top-level framework, with trickier detailed decisions delayed. But those involved in the process have rebutted that idea.

The placards they carry declare: “Water is not for sale.” A heavy chant accompanies the march: “It’s not a drought – it’s plunder!” At a rallying point in the city, protesters read from a manifesto and accuse the government of prioritising profit over water, health and land. They denounce a wave of mega-projects imposed without their consent, from   to the   tourist expansion. But they reserve their greatest anger for the Heineken brewery in Kanasín, near Mérida, which was  . To many of Yucatán’s Maya people, the plans for the Heineken factory are seen not as a promising development, but as a continuation of a deeper problem: of government-backed industrial developments that threaten water supplies and human rights, leaving local communities caught in an uneven conflict to protect their cultural and environmental survival. As part of a $2.75bn (£2.05bn) investment plan, the Heineken brewery is expected to generate  , including  . Indigenous communities have   – disputing the company’s claim that consultations took place   – and raising concerns about its environmental impacts, particularly the effects of its water use on local communities. “It not only threatens our water through contamination, but could make it harder for people in poverty to access it,” says Pedro Uc Be, an activist with Múuch’ Xíinbal. Kanasín lies within the Yucatán’s  , a network of underground aquifers of spiritual and practical significance to the Maya and an important source of drinking water. Several studies have   from human activity within the cenote water supply.  (100m US gallons) of beer a year, and plans to limit water use to two litres for every litre of beer.   suggests this could mean losing 1bn litres of water at the current rate of 2.6 litres for every litre of beer. Activists say this is   in a region where about 121,000 people  , and water availability has fallen by more than 50% since 2003. The   has also noted that in some rural areas of Mexico, alcohol is more readily available than drinking water.  its new brewery will reduce its water consumption with “circular economy practices that ensure water re-use through cutting-edge treatment systems” and aims to minimise waste and operate using renewable energy. But Adrian Forrester, founder of the Mexican craft brewery Cerveceria Bóruma, says this is not enough. Most of the water used to clean production tanks can be recycled, he says, but the enormous volume of Heineken’s production inevitably makes it water-intensive. “Beer is primarily water; they are still taking a lot out to make the product. That’s millions of litres a day,” he says. The pressure on water supply, Forrester says, is “less about the water recycling, and more about the raw extraction of groundwater to produce at that scale”. Communities are also concerned about pollution. Large-scale   produced during beer manufacturing, as it contains high levels of chemicals and organic compounds that can harm soils and contaminate groundwater. Uc Be worries about compliance. “Unfortunately, these companies have a history of claiming they will treat the wastewater using the latest technology to prevent contamination, but then they do not.” He mentions the huge pig farms, which were accused of   with untreated wastewater. Allegations were made against the Modelo brewery in Hunucmá in 2018 after the   in the drinking water of 40 Yucatán municipalities. An   published in July found that only 3% of the state’s wastewater was being treated, which it attributes to a lack of operational plants. Heineken says it conducted a free, prior and informed consultation with assistance from the Kanasín state government, in which “communities approved the project and agreements for shared benefits were signed”. The company also says it carried out a water-feasibility study before investing in the project, that its water usage follows the principles “reduce, re-use and replenish”, and that it aims for the new brewery to exceed the water consumption efficiency of its Meoqui plant in the state of Chihuahua – 1.7 litres of water for every litre of beer. ndigenous groups say they are often excluded from decisions that affect their land and water. Mexico has signed an   that requires “free and informed consent” from Indigenous peoples before activities that could affect them are undertaken, but the Maya feel that right is systematically ignored.  and   have criticised consultations around the vast   rail project as exclusionary and inadequate. A lack of consultation   of court proceedings brought against a pig farm by six children in Homún, and communities in   successfully challenged a solar farm on the same grounds. For Indigenous communities, consultation matters. A global study by 18 researchers has found that large industrial projects often cause   if they are not developed with the full support of local groups. “The problem with such large-scale projects,” says the research lead, Arnim Scheidel, “is that they significantly change not only social relations, but also the local environment, which is often closely tied to cultural landscapes, sense of place and traditional ecological knowledge.” Uc Be is concerned about cultural erasure caused by the surge of mega-projects across the region. “The Heineken project will bring gentrification and instability. The jobs it creates will be filled by outsiders who don’t understand our cultural situation.” Alarmed by the experiences of counterparts along the Maya Train route, he also fears the influx of outsiders could increase his community’s vulnerability to opportunistic organised crime groups. Residents of various municipalities there have reported  , substance abuse, sexual harassment and violence. With limited political inclusion, some Maya groups have turned to the courts for support. In June 2024, 21 communities demanded a moratorium on new industrialised pig megafarms; although the request failed, parallel legal actions resulted in   and fines for  . Last year, in a case that is still pending, the conservation group Guardians of the Cenotes filed a lawsuit against the state   for the underground lakes. But legal action is expensive and can take years to resolve. By the time   to halt work on two sections of the Maya Train in January, the tracks had already been constructed. Uc Be says he does not know what Múuch’ Xíinbal will do next. “We don’t have a way to stop the project right now. It’s a huge challenge,” he says. However, they are not admitting defeat. While their resources are dwarfed by the scale of the brewery’s investment and its government backing, the Maya believe their strength depends on staying united. “We act because we do not consent to our own murder. Only by recognising ourselves as one body, one life, can we continue as a Maya culture,” he says. “Just surviving is an act of resistance.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

The 3,568MW plant, built to provide power for 45 million people, released a muddy torrent that flooded his neighbourhood, forcing 120 families to evacuate. “The river has gone out of control. We used to know when it would flood and when it would dry up. Now nobody knows any more,” says Nascimento, a rancher. “What men call progress has killed our history.” His is a sad tale, but not uncommon in the Amazon, where public works driven by political ambition and economic upswing have replaced the wilderness with boom towns, highways, dams and farms. While these projects have brought paved roads, electricity and jobs, they have also caused upheaval through  ,  ,   and  . Fuelled by undaunted farmers and pioneering crop science, the soya bean industry has spread deep into the Amazon, blanketing the land, filling silos, helping convert Brazil into   and propelling the country’s  . Studies show that transport of soya beans and maize in the so-called Amazon arc – the infrastructure for hauling crops – grew 4.8% in the past year and by  . As the agricultural belt expands, it is reshaping the map of the Amazonian environment, infrastructure, commerce, politics and livelihoods. Brazil is now one of the world’s most bounteous agricultural producers, driven by harvests in the Cerrado, or central scrublands, and more recently in the Amazon biome. Soya beans are now   and cover more than half the nation’s arable land, from the pampas to the equator. In the first five months of 2025, Brazil became the top soya bean exporter with 51.53m tonnes, a   from the same period of 2024. Nearly 80% of soya beans are used for livestock and aquaculture, as China, the main buyer, uses  , linking rising global meat demand to Brazil’s expanding exports. Three decades ago, only four of the nine Amazonian states planted soya beans. Today, all nine do, helping to make the legume Brazil’s fastest-growing commodity. Mato Grosso, a huge state that straddles the Cerrado and the Amazon, is the nation’s top producer. In Rondônia, soya bean cultivation   since 2019, as has the economy. Under increasing public pressure, traders and big producers of the beans   in 2006, committing to forgo buying and selling soya beans grown on Amazonian plots deforested after 2008. In 2023, the  , not only banning the sale of soya beans – and six other commodity crops – harvested from recently cleared Amazonian lands, but also requiring buyers to prove their imports were deforestation-free. The good news for agribusiness is that the tighter restrictions have not curtailed productivity. According to   on the Amazon soya bean moratorium, although 95.6% of the expansion occurred in areas that were already affected by human activity before 2008,   in the Amazon was cleared after the ban, and cultivation in untouched forest nearly tripled from 2018 to 2023, reaching 250,000 hectares (620,000 acres). These figures used to be controversial in Brazil – a cause for celebration for large producers and denounced by environmentalists, who are preparing for  , the critical UN climate conference in November. Amazonian growers, however, continued to grumble that the soya moratorium was too prohibitive and violated free enterprise. They claimed that the rule barred land clearing   – under Brazil’s  , Amazonian farms may deforest up to 20% of their property. Last year, three Amazonian governors, led by Rondônia’s Marcos Rocha, passed laws   to signatories of the moratorium, alleging the pact amounted to a soya cartel. They drew praise from local farmers, many of whom had been caught out clearing forest for planting. Brazil’s  , agreed and, on 18 August,   on the grounds that it unfairly advantaged a few big traders and farmers over medium and small-scale soya bean producers. A federal judge  , and reinstated the moratorium. But with the agricultural lobby flexing its muscles in Brasília, the quarrel is far from over. Even if the moratorium holds, risks to the rainforest and its inhabitants remain. Nascimento –   to friends and family – has a front-row seat watching the soya bean boom. After shuttling between cheap hotels for nearly a year, he resettled in a small villa 16 miles (25km) from Porto Velho. Though he is not at risk of losing another home, the retired 70-year-old has watched uneasily as the land around him is surrendered to soya beans. “They invaded our land,” says Nascimento. “But because we hadn’t built on our lot, they moved in, planted soya beans right up to the fence, and stayed.” The cash crop has encircled his neighbourhood, overrun a local cemetery and now stretches to the horizon. Some days, the air is so thick with clouds of herbicides and pesticides that he can taste it. First, there’s “the tingling sensation” in his face. Then comes “the dizziness” and “difficulty breathing”, he says. “It’s not just me. Everyone over here feels it.” To planters, this is the scent of progress. Although most soya bean farmers are   in Amazon predation, the European Commission has traced strong indirect links between clearcutting and soya sowing. This is the case in Mato Grosso, where mechanised farms typically take over spent pasture, displacing ranchers such as Nascimento into pristine areas of neighbouring Pará, in the eastern Amazon basin. That pattern also drives up the price of forested land, in the expectation of future gains once the trees are gone – “even though soya bean is planted years after”, the European Commission concluded. Sign up to  Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion Critically, however, even if no more trees fall to farmers, expanding soya bean plantations fuel the lobby’s demands for bigger and better infrastructure to store and ship their harvest to international markets. Hence the clamour to lay more asphalt, dredge rivers, build bridges and ports, and put down rails to haul ever bigger loads over already strained Amazonian transport networks. Take the  , where every harvest brings traffic to a standstill. “We see 3,000 to 4,000 soya [articulated truck] rigs a day pass through Porto Velho,” says Adélio Barofaldi, chief executive of Rovema, a logistics company in Rondônia. “We are talking about 200km of gridlock every day.” To ease bottlenecks, the federal government recently privatised part of the highway, with plans to duplicate a critical 60-mile stretch, tellingly nicknamed the “ ”. All to the detriment of the wilderness. A study found that nearly 95% of Amazon deforestation in Brazil falls  . In the Colombian Amazon, 80% of forest clearance occurs within less than 5 miles of roads. But roads lead to more roads. A recent study comparing the   in tropical regions found that every mile of official “first-cut road” in the Amazon basin generated another 30 miles of secondary roads. And much more clearcutting and degradation happened around secondary tracks than official routes. Soya’s success in the Americas is a cautionary tale, says Sandro Dutra e Silva, an environmental historian at Goiás State University  . “Tropical agriculture has been hailed as a miracle, transforming Brazil into a farming power,” he says. However, because the savanna sits on South America’s key aquifers, overproduction could disrupt watersheds and weather. “The risk is that this technological triumph might hypnotise people into destroying the Cerrado and Amazonia,” Dutra says. Alexandre Nepomuceno, head of soya bean research at  , Brazil’s national agricultural institute – which developed soya strains that thrived in the tropics, boosting the seed’s use in the Amazon – cautions against vilifying scientific achievement for policy shortcomings. He says the same enterprising scientific tradition that brought harvests to the equator can also help Amazonian growers tread more lightly on the land. Mariangela Hungria, a Brazilian soil microbiology expert, won the 2025   for her research into strains of bacteria that suck nitrogen from the air and attach it  , all but eliminating the need to import costly petroleum-based fertilisers. Last year, such biological nitrogen fixation delivered Brazil a bumper crop, saved $25m (£18.5m) in imported fertiliser, and avoided emitting   into the atmosphere. Nepomuceno says that cutting-edge research can show the way. Still, science alone cannot save the Amazon. According to him, that is a job for policymakers, lawmakers and the public authorities that make the rules and enforce the red lines. “Given that   already has plenty of deforested areas,” Nepomuceno says, “we have no need of clearing more land to grow soya beans.”  This article was amended on 29 September 2025 to include additional context regarding the use of soya beans for animal and fish feed.", "tags": ["amazon", "rainforest", "southern", "frontlines:", "latin", "america", "and", "the", "caribbean", "deforestation", "trees", "and", "forests", "conservation", "agriculture", "brazil", "americas", "features"]},

On one side are the Sudanese armed forces who remain broadly loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s de facto ruler. Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militia who follow the former warlord  , known as Hemedti. The RSF was founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia. Bashir wanted to crush a rebellion in the region of   that began more than 20 years ago due to the political and economic marginalisation of the local population. Initially known as the  , the RSF quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into a semi-organised paramilitary force and gave its leaders military ranks before deploying it to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur. Hemedti’s power struggle with Burhan can be traced back to 2019 when the RSF and regular military forces cooperated to   from power. When attempts to transition to a democratic civilian-led government faltered, many analysts felt an eventual showdown between Burhan and Hemedti was inevitable. The conflict has plunged Sudan into what the   “one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history”. Tens of thousands have died, millions have been displaced, and hunger and disease are rife. According to the most recent figures, about 26 million people face severe food insecurity. Famine has been declared in the Zamzam displacement camp in Darfur. About 11.3 million people have been forced to flee the fighting, including nearly 2.95 million who have fled across the country’s borders. Most have gone to Chad and South  , where underfunded aid agencies say they are struggling to meet basic needs. A UN appeal for $1.51bn to support Sudanese refugees and their hosts in the region through the end of the year remains just 27% funded. In its latest humanitarian update, published on 1 October, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said significant declines in vaccination rates and the destruction of health infrastructure resulting from the war mean Sudan is grappling with multiple disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria, dengue fever, measles, and rubella. An estimated 3.4 million children under the age of five are at high risk of epidemic diseases, according to Unicef. The conflict has also robbed huge numbers of an education. More than 90% of the country’s 19 million school-age children are unable to access formal education. Schools have been targeted in airstrikes, occupied by armed groups and used to store weapons. The UN has accused the army and the RSF of carrying out indiscriminate attacks in residential areas, committing acts of sexual violence, arbitrarily detaining and torturing civilians and recruiting child soldiers. Both parties may have committed war crimes, a UN report in February said. They have denied the claims. The US went a step further last year, declaring that both had carried out war crimes and that the RSF had committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Some of the war’s worst atrocities have been committed in Darfur, western Sudan. As many as 15,000 people were killed in the city of El Geneina in West Darfur last year by the RSF and allied Arab militias in violence targeted at the Masalit people. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the violence carried “haunting echoes of the genocide that began almost 20 years ago”. In June, pro-democracy activists said the RSF killed more than 100 people in an attack on a village in central Sudan. In recent weeks, the RSF has launched a full-scale attack on El Fasher, the only major population centre in Darfur it is yet to control. The attack follows a months-long siege. The city’s last hospital was   after the paramilitary group stormed it in June. The RSF is also advancing in regions south of Khartoum. In the capital, which fell to the RSF early on in the war, the armed forces have gone on the offensive, pounding the centre and south of the city from the air this month. Several rounds of negotiation efforts have so far failed to end the fighting. Home to about 9 million people, Darfur, the vast and largely arid swath of western and south-western  , has been at the centre of the conflict largely because it remains the stronghold of Hemedti. Many of the RSF’s recruits are drawn from the region and from Hemedti’s own Rizeigat tribe. For years, the RSF has terrorised communities in Darfur and much of the region is lawless: militias and other armed groups attack civilians with virtual impunity. In recent years, the RSF has invested significant resources in Darfur in an attempt to control its strategic assets, such as airstrips, mines, water sources and major roads. Analysts trace many of the roots of the latest conflict back to the appalling violence and human rights abuses in Darfur about 20 years ago.", "tags": ["sudan", "chad", "darfur", "africa", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "conflict", "and", "arms", "explainers"]},

This allowed my work to expand while remaining rooted in the same themes that first pushed me to create. This photograph is a direct result of that shift.

I cried, I resisted. The pain was doubled because even at that age I was already drawn to reading about rights and freedoms. My suffering came from knowing that my rights were being violated, along with my adolescence and childhood. But soon I had to accept the situation after hair was ripped from my head, my face smashed to the ground and threats of being pulled out of school. Any attempt to refuse this groom in front of him or his family, I was told, would end in my death. I remember the nights before meeting him: my mother threatened to strangle me in my sleep, while my father described in detail how he would take me to the relatives’ village and throw me into a well. I begged my aunts, who themselves had been married off young and against their will. They refused to intervene, perhaps out of fear of reopening their own wounds. I was left alone to endure beatings, psychological pressure and the daily chorus of being a shame for wanting to break my father’s word. Yet was my father himself not a disgrace to humanity, to mercy, for ignoring his child’s tears? I began to blame my body, which already looked like that of a 20-year-old. In another country, such a body might have been encouraged in sport or modelling. Here, it was seen as something to be covered up through forced marriage. I hated my period, because it qualified me for this marriage; its pain became a greater pain. I hated my future husband. I hated the dress, the songs – and I hated myself. On the day of the marriage, I remember the girl in the beauty salon who struggled to apply makeup to my childish face, my tears turning it into a puddle, until she cried with me. For most women this is a day of joyful tears. For me, it became a stain. I was a doll in the middle of songs and laughter – laughter that was not mine, words of celebration that did not belong to me. I sat beside him, part of my growing chest exposed by the dress his mother had chosen. Everything was chosen for me; I chose nothing. That day exists only as a blur. Each time he tried to slip the ring on my finger, I pulled away. Relatives thought I was being shy. In truth, I felt disgusted. I barely spoke to him. My hatred was so intense I imagined plunging the cake knife into his heart. How could he want to marry a child, even if her body looked fully grown? In the early days I avoided him, focusing on exams and schoolwork. But his gifts, his attention and his kindness – against the backdrop of my family’s violence and pressure – gradually weakened the sharp edge of my hatred. I became confused. Do I hate you, or love you? I ran out of ways to keep hating him and avoiding him. Sickness, exams, headaches – I even forced myself to vomit to stay in bed. Then, a month later, my father beat me more violently than ever before – snapping a cane across my back, then reaching for a hammer, a wrench, anything within his grasp. All because I had used the phone at the wrong time. I remember how my husband touched the wounds on my hands, how he refused to believe the story that I had fallen down the stairs, how I cried in front of him and he did not press me for details. Maybe this man, who would not allow me to go to university and wanted me to wear the   and  , would still be more merciful than my father? He was kinder, and my family encouraged me to stay with him alone, hoping I would warm to him. He was affectionate and generous. But I could not tell – did I love him, or the affection he gave me? When he left, I hated him. When my family turned cruel, I loved him. It was too much confusion for a girl my age. One day, as he was helping me with a school subject close to his speciality, he suddenly kissed me. My body reacted with both a gentle shiver and a tickle of pleasure, and then with anger that burst out in a scream. I did not want my first kiss to be with him. Even now, I feel it was stolen from me. He stole from me the choice of who would kiss me first – even if that man would later betray me or leave me. I wanted the right to choose. At the time, my scream was interpreted as shyness, as having crossed a “taboo”. According to how we were raised, a man was not supposed to touch his wife before the wedding night [in   the public wedding party takes place at a later date after the marriage]. After that kiss, he began to tame me in ways I only understood years later. With every complaint I had about school, family or dreams he silenced me with a longer kiss, awakening places in my body I had not discovered. He turned study time or rare outings into moments of sexual play. He began to teach me what marriage and intimacy meant. When I refused his touch, he sulked and blamed me for his desire, making me feel responsible for satisfying him. “You are my wife,” he would say, placing on me the burden of relieving his lust. Later I learned this was emotional manipulation – whether intentional or not – of a teenager experiencing her sexuality for the first time. I don’t know if he was a womaniser, but he knew how to make me surrender – out of fear of losing him and a craving for the sweetness he offered. I grew afraid of disappointing him. I don’t know how I reached that point after just two years with him. I felt ashamed, especially when I did not want the kisses, the touches, the fantasies. And yet often I longed for him. Sign up to  Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion I began to wait for him, to want him. My hatred weakened. I forgot my dreams and began to accept the life awaiting me, because perhaps it was less violent. Because of disputes between his family and mine, we separated after three and a half years. I did not fight it; I was in survival mode. The shock was that I felt relief. What I had mistaken for love vanished in seconds. I admit I missed him for a year, but then came only guilt for giving him parts of my body. Why had I not resisted? The question haunted me. My memories became a flood of intimate moments, each filled with shame. I had been raised to believe that a woman’s body was tainted if touched by a man who was not her husband. For years this distorted my view of men and relationships. Love became tied exclusively to sex. Even when I liked someone, I never told them about this relationship, afraid they would see me as “defiled” or demand explanations for feelings I could not name. I began to feel disgusted by my body, by myself. I entered a spiral of guilt. But was I truly guilty? Why did I blame a 14-year-old child instead of the 30-year-old man? Why did I not blame the family that left a girl alone with a man full of desire? I blamed myself even for saying “I love you” to him, a phrase that had been false and delusional. But was it really love? Or was it non-consensual all along? I felt too ashamed to tell this story to anyone even after I became, to some extent, an independent woman after many family struggles. What helped me most was financial independence, which opened different doors to freedom. A friend always told me: “A child should not feel shame.” But shame kept me silent, even with three different therapists. As my knowledge of rights and freedoms grew, so did my guilt. Why had I not fought for my freedom? But this all changed after I spoke to a therapist. She did not blame or judge me. When I tried to hold back my tears, she allowed me to cry. I went through a long process of guilt and shame, of learning to accept that I had not been at fault, that I had been a victim. Now, I am a survivor. What I went through was not love. It was a form of early forced marriage that dragged me into emotional and psychological confusion I was not ready for. I was a child. Every swing between hate and desire, fear and survival, was only the echo of childhood trauma. I clung to the man imposed on me, not because I truly loved him, but because he seemed, in the harshest moments, more merciful than my own family, who beat me and threatened me with death. I learned to see him as a protector, when in truth he was part of the circle of control over me. Psychology calls this “trauma bonding”. My first kiss was not love, but the theft of choice. My first touch was not desire, but the result of emotional blackmail that placed blame on me each time I refused. Over the years my body swung between pleasure and shame, as if I were responsible for his lust, as if my fault was not screaming louder or running farther. But now I know the fault was not mine. It was not the fault of a 14-year-old who did not know how to protect herself. It was the fault of an adult man who exploited my vulnerability, of a family, a society, and a law that abandoned me. Every day I remind myself that what I lived through was not love, but violence that stripped me of childhood and choice. The lingering confusion between “I love you” and “I hate you” is nothing but the scar of a deep wound from a time when I was forced to carry what no child’s heart or body should bear. Today I feel the need to tell this story. My experience was not an isolated incident, but an early glimpse of what   may mean. It opens the door for my story to repeat itself with countless other girls – children who will be robbed of choice and pushed into unequal relationships under the cover of law. Passing such a law means nothing but  , turning childhood into a marriage contract instead of a time for safety and growth.

After each operation the police death squads would haunt Manila’s bars to take the edge off, and because some were superstitious, to ward off malevolent spirits following them home. “Imagine, I kill 47 people and can just sleep? No, I was drinking, drinking just to sleep,” says one. “You need to release stress and we are Filipino … If we go home after killing, the spirit may follow you.” Rights groups believe up to 30,000 alleged drug users and dealers were slaughtered in the so-called   that wracked the Philippines after Rodrigo Duterte assumed power in 2016. Many of those killings, it is alleged, were at the hands of secretive police death squads. Eight years on, Duterte is detained at The Hague, where he has been charged with crimes against humanity at the international criminal court (ICC) for allegedly orchestrating the campaign. But in Manila some police officers involved say their boozy, sleepless nights are over. The Guardian interviewed four Philippine national police officers, including three former death squad members and one homicide detective, who were part of teams they claim killed about 400 people, including in senseless “vendettas”. As victims’ families long for justice, the officers are largely unrepentant, and across the   a deep affection for Duterte endures. All the officers interviewed – two of whom have since retired – believe the killing spree was justified. “Bad people”, they agreed, deserve to die. The Philippine police did not respond to questions from the Guardian but a former police chief who oversaw the campaign previously described allegations of state-sanctioned death squads as “fiction”. Duterte’s legal counsel at the ICC, Nick Kaufman, said court media policy prevented him from responding in detail to the allegations. “All I can say is that these recycled allegations are both thoroughly stale and vehemently denied,” he said via email. “Despite the attempts of a few obstinate politicians bent on destroying his legacy, Mr Duterte continues to enjoy huge support both at home and abroad. He served his country faithfully and with pride.” Duterte   of “gangsters” in Davao – a model the ICC says he later nationalised – but denied as president to ordering police to conduct extrajudicial killings. Over lunch in a gaudy Manila hotel, one active officer reflected on his role in the drug war, speaking to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity. Unassuming in glasses and a blue button-up shirt, the officer says most of those killed committed “heinous” crimes such as rape and murder. “If you are taking drugs and you don’t have money, how will you get your money? You will do nasty things to support your engagement in your drugs. So for me it’s OK, let them die if they deserve to die,” he says nonchalantly over a plate of fried chicken and rice. “An eye for eye, and a tooth for a tooth if they deserve to die.” Everyone deserves a day in court, he quips, except for “someone who really does not deserve to live”. “Duterte would always say: ‘If I need to kill you, I will kill you for the safety of most of the people of this country,’ and that is my view also,” he says, adding that he was convinced during Duterte’s time that there was “peace”. Duterte, a populist and charismatic leader known for his outlandish, sometimes bloodthirsty statements, left office in 2022 but affection for his strongman rule persists. At the peak of the drug wars, the killings were both incessant and macabre. Night after night, dead bodies were dumped in the street, their heads wrapped in masking tape with placards featuring ominous warnings such as: “ ”, or “Don’t be a drug pusher like him”. Many of those slain were poor and marginalised, their names compiled on watch lists of suspected dealers and users. In theory, the police were meant to verify their activity. In practice, alleged one officer, they were kill lists. “Under the 10 commandments thou shall not kill,” the officer says, casually continuing to expound his view of justice. “There is no commandment that thou shall not kill drug pushers.” In the deeply Catholic, Philippines references to the church are never far off, with religion providing solace to both perpetrators and victims. “Every time I do it I go to the church and make my confession,” the officer says of his efforts to seek absolution. Initially he was haunted by “flashbacks” and fears of supernatural retribution. Now, he says: “I feel like I am forgiven already. No more bad dreams.” Even if 30,000 were killed, that’s less than 1% of the population, he calculates indifferently. If anything, he laments, the drug wars delayed his promotion. The official narrative during the drug wars was that the killings were perpetrated by “vigilantes”, or that people were shot dead by police as suspects fought back after resisting arrest. Yet within the police, it was allegedly an “open secret” it was an inside job, one retired homicide investigator tells the Guardian. “When there was a body with a placard, we wouldn’t do a full investigation,” he admits. “Even though we knew, we just put on the report that it [the body] was dumped … we knew the police did it.” Rights groups and victims’ relatives have long claimed there was no due process, no arrests or charges, or that crime scenes were staged or tampered with. The homicide investigator says that when they saw a gun at the scene, police would automatically write “ ”, referring to a suspect fighting back. “It was just a scenario,” he says of reports he personally falsified. In his retirement now, he has no regrets. “I’m very proud of myself because so many people died,” he says. “Hopefully many more die again. There are still a lot of bad people.” “They never fought back,” another retired death squad member alleges. “There was no gunpowder on their hands. But no one dared to investigate, they were scared of Duterte.” As names on the “kill lists” were exhausted, the hits increasingly became personal vendettas, he says, with names supplied by informants to fulfil alleged quotas set for police stations. “I feel guilty about that,” he says. His team would seize suspects and take them back to the station and if no one came looking for them in two days, he says, they would be taken in a car and shot at close range in the back seat. Later they dumped the bodies in areas without CCTV. “I hated that car,” he says. “It smelt of blood.” Among the more than 14 million residents of Metro Manila, a fondness for Duterte lingers years after he left office. Asked who was her favourite Philippine president, 67-year-old coconut seller Osephina Gabriel, was unequivocal. “Duterte,” she says. “He has a strong hand. “There were no criminals when he was president. During Duterte’s time there was no petty crime at night. There was peace.” The deaths, she shrugs, were necessary collateral and Duterte “did what he had to do.” It is a refrain oft repeated by Filipinos, who say they felt safer even as thousands were killed as they slept. Criticised abroad, Duterte’s common-man image is part of his lasting appeal at home. A Pulse Asia Research survey conducted in May showed that 63% of Filipinos trust Duterte. So entrenched is the affection that in May the 80-year-old   while imprisoned at The Hague. “I questioned why he was arrested,” says pedicab driver Antonio Arregio. “Maybe it was because of politics.” “We’re still in the midst of this propaganda war with the Dutertes who propagated the myth of the war on drugs,” says former senator Antonio Trillanes of a leader he argues created a “cult following” through “deception, misinformation and fear”. “He was very charismatic, to the point that he was able to convince them that this is morally justified,” he says. When Duterte was arrested in March, Teresita Beranal felt the first glimmer of hope that justice might finally be served. In August 2017 her son was shot dead by four men who dragged his dead body through the neighbourhood “like a pig”. “I know many others who also lost their children. I can’t count,” she says. “I hope we can get justice. Our loved ones are not animals.” But with the exception of a few egregious cases, accountability remains elusive and investigations slow going. Few officers have been found guilty, or even tried. The Philippine commission of human rights (CHR) is working to obtain thousands of related police reports, but it is an inherently fraught exercise. “It’s a challenge because almost all police stations were involved during the drug war in one way or another,” says CHR’s chairperson, Richard Palpal-latoc. Overall, any kind of national reckoning appears a long way off. Journalist and author Patricia Evangelista says: “To expect that the nation does a sudden turn about a man they love, a man they worship, just because he has been taken by an international court … is too much to expect, I think, immediately.” A poll by Social Weather Stations in February found that only 51% of Filipinos believe Duterte should be held accountable for those killed. Reflecting on the crackdown, a fourth officer says he feels disillusioned by the drug wars, but mostly because of his teammates that went rogue. “They [dealers and criminals] offer you everything – almost heaven – in exchange to protect [them],” he says of his colleagues that switched sides. “All of a sudden you were a warrior in the war on drugs [and then you] become a protector of drug syndicates.” He doesn’t regret the kills, though, rating his death squad “70 out of 100”. “What we have done is in the eyes of God and human beings – it’s bad, you know. But on the other side of doing it, it serves the purpose,” he says. “Maybe if they were still alive now, they would still be doing bad things.” A third death squad member agrees the drug wars degenerated badly in the end. In a Senate inquiry last October, police officers revealed new details about alleged quotas, and a “reward system”, starting at 20,000 pesos (about $350/£260) a head. Three officers who were interviewed confirmed they received the funds, but said the money was to cover “operational costs” such as stakeouts and petrol, with the lion’s share going to the officer who pulled the trigger. One officer characterised the funds as “bad luck” money, better spent on drinking than anything else. Despite their seeming lack of remorse, Duterte’s arrest has stirred a sense of unease among those once on the front line of his bloody campaign. “Sometimes you are getting nervous,” admits the first officer over lunch. “If they are running after your boss and he is a statesman who has money to defend himself and he is now in the ICC,” he says, pausing, “what about me? I am just an ordinary Tom, Dick and Harry.”", "tags": ["rights", "and", "freedom", "philippines", "rodrigo", "duterte", "asia", "pacific", "features"]},

I do not feel ashamed because my starvation is deliberate. I refuse my hunger even as it decays me. I can survive no other way. Since 2 March 2025,   has imposed a full blockade on Gaza. Little aid – food, medicine, fuel – is getting in or being distributed. The markets are empty and bakeries, community kitchens and fuel stations are shuttered.

The distribution points of US and Israeli-backed   have been denounced as “death traps”, the UN warning that the system   and has cost more lives than it has saved. Famine is no longer a threat – it is here. Some days, my stomach cramps as I try to revise a single paragraph. My fingers feel dry and achy, parched from lack of fluids.   is loud. I read, but hunger is shouting in my ear. I write, but the maw snaps with every keystroke. And when I try to still myself, to think in the meagre pleasures of drone-infused quiet, my mind floats: what rabbit hole could I be down if I were in a library? Oh, for a coffee in between articles. A sandwich in between sentences. A snack alongside a lazy perusal of the latest issue of TESOL Quarterly. I wonder: how can I keep my mind sharp when my body has gone so thin and dehydrated? The hunger starts with a rumble, and it spreads so quickly. My legs barely carry me to the nearest internet cafe. There, I try to keep up with work and commitments, charge my devices, and catch a brief connection to the outside world. But with a heavy laptop bag on my shoulder, the journey feels less like a short walk and more like crossing a desert. Some days, survival comes down to a single sachet of Plumpy’Nut, a peanut-based nutrient paste usually distributed for free in famine zones, but here sold for about $3.50, a price many can no longer afford. If you are more fortunate, you might buy a few overpriced fortified biscuits. But the problem is not just paying for food. It is about accessing money in the first place. With every bank in   damaged and not a single functioning ATM left, cash has become both scarce and essential. Online transactions, or Eftpos, are not common here – almost all purchases depend on cash. After nearly two years of war, banknotes are torn and worn, and often rejected in shops. Getting money from your own account can be exploitative: withdrawing through an informal money exchange outside standard bank processes can cost up to 50% in commission. This deeply contradicts the spirit of Gaza – known for its generosity, where neighbours always looked after one another, and where, for as long as many of us can remember, no one went to bed hungry if someone else had food to share. That spirit has not vanished. People still share what little they have. But the scale of deprivation has grown so severe that even the most generous hands are now often empty. Families go to bed hungry and wake up hungry. One day in particular, I had been working nonstop, pushing through dizziness and exhaustion. By the time I reached the stairs to my apartment, my legs were barely holding me up. My blood sugar had crashed. I collapsed just as I reached my bedroom. I was rushed to the nearest GP, where I was given an IV [intravenous fluids] to stabilise me. The next morning, I was back at work. Not because I had recovered, but because I felt I could not afford to stop. There were interviews to conduct and transcribe, students to support, messages that needed to be sent. The urgency to bear witness outweighed the need to rest. This is not about ego. It is about refusing to disappear. About resisting the slow erasure that comes with war and famine. About insisting that our thoughts and our work continue, even when it must be done in the ruins. In Gaza, to be an academic today is to refuse to be reduced to a statistic. There are days when continuing feels impossible. The body simply gives out. Reading leaves me light-headed. Concentration slips away. Teaching becomes a battle to remain coherent. And beyond the physical toll, there is another erosion – of identity. As scholars, we are meant to cultivate emancipatory and liberatory thinking among our students. But when our daily realities are hunger, grief and displacement, we begin to question whether we are still fulfilling that role. What does it mean to be a scholar when the conditions needed to think, teach and create are stripped away? What does academic freedom mean when intellectual, political and pedagogical freedom is restricted by siege? What does it mean to mentor youth towards critical inquiry when we ourselves are battling to stay upright? These questions linger, not as abstract concerns but as lived tensions. Still, we carry on. Because to stop would be to relinquish one of the last remnants of our agency. I often find myself caught between two difficult choices in the classroom: either avoid discussing the crisis, fearing retraumatising my students; or confront it directly, opening space for collective reflection. Both paths are fraught, yet driven by the same hope – to use education not only to inform, but to liberate in helping students believe their voices still matter. Sign up to  Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion The work goes on. Research calls. Project check-ins. Webinars. Recorded lectures. Training sessions, though they must often pause. This is our reality. Still, we show up: attending classes, writing proposals, giving talks, joining conferences, publishing. Not because we are strong or brave, but because we believe in the transformative power of education. And because to stop would be to give in to silence. Yet, the most basic truth remains difficult to say aloud: we are hungry. Not by accident, but by design. When did naming that become taboo? For days, split lentils have been my only meal. Finding flour is a scavenger hunt. And when we do manage to gather ingredients, baking over an open fire is exhausting, physically and emotionally. We burn wood from broken furniture to make bread. Used notebooks and scrap paper become fuel; otherwise, we must buy wood just to finish the job. This is not just about hunger. It is about being forced to fight for survival in silence. Lighting a fire is a daunting challenge. Matches have run out. Lighters are nearly impossible to replace – and when one is available, it can be prohibitively expensive. Those who still have a working lighter refill it cautiously with small amounts of gas. In many cases, families or neighbours share a single flame, passing it from household to household – another quiet act of solidarity and enduring spirit. So we keep documenting. Not out of heroism, but to remain present. Because behind every report, every footnote, every lecture lies a deeper truth: knowledge is still being produced in Gaza. Even now. Especially now. What does solidarity mean when some of us must think, teach and work while starving? What does inclusion mean when access to food, water and safety determines who gets to take part? This is not a call for charity. It is a call to face an uncomfortable truth: solidarity is meaningless if it does not name – and challenge – the systems that keep people excluded while they struggle to survive under siege, occupation and deliberate deprivation. True solidarity means asking hard questions: Who gets to speak? Who is heard? Who can keep learning and imagining a future when bombs fall and hunger bites? Solidarity means changing the way the world works with those in crisis: adapting deadlines, waiving fees, opening access to books and journals, and making space for voices from Gaza and beyond – not as victims but as equal partners. It means understanding that grief, hunger and destroyed infrastructure are not “disruptions” to work – they are our current conditions of life. To generate knowledge in the context of hunger is to think through pain. To teach students who have not eaten and still tell them their voices matter. To insist, against all odds, that Gaza still thinks, still questions, still creates. That, in itself, is an act of resistance.

The largely Tibetan parts of the province have become a   for holidaymakers. But the 22-year-old, on a break from her studies in Europe, told friends she was saddened by what she saw. While she could hear conversations in Tibetan everywhere, all of the signage was in Mandarin Chinese. Every shop and restaurant she passed appeared to be Chinese owned, not Tibetan. Every lamp-post was decorated with Chinese flags; an endless river of red flowing above them against a cloudy summer sky. It felt to her like Tibetan culture and identity was being erased. The experience started her on a path that would end with her arrest and disappearance. Her story appears to be the latest example of Beijing targeting activism taking place overseas. Last year the Chinese authorities put a   in support of democracy in Hong Kong. \n  Growing up a Buddhist, Zhang became increasingly interested in the Tibetan form of the religion at high school in   and began practising it soon afterwards. Her friends say she also became more aware of the plight of ethnic minorities. After arriving in   in 2022, she became outspoken about human rights abuses, and last year began writing for a pro-Tibetan newsletter run by the activist group Chinese Youth Stand For Tibet (CYST). “She always spoke about the problems in   faced by Mongolians, Tibetans and Uyghurs. She says she was really upset in school because she couldn’t really share what she felt,” says Kalsang Yarphel, Zhang’s Tibetan partner of two years. “But once she started writing [for the pro-Tibetan newsletter] and saw that people around her really appreciated her work and her heart, she was less depressed,” he says. China   that bans actions that “damage ethnic unity” even if they take place overseas. It has also increasingly pushed foreign institutions to refer to Tibet as “Xizang”, the country’s name in Mandarin, according to Human Rights Watch.

Transnational repression is the state-led targeting of refugees, dissidents and ordinary citizens living in exile. It involves the use of electronic surveillance, physical assault, intimidation and threats against family members to silence criticism. The Guardian’s Rights and freedom series is   to highlight the dangers faced by citizens in countries including the UK. Zhang returned to China this summer and had planned to travel into more Tibetan regions, but she was arrested in late July. Neither her family nor friends have had any contact with her since then. She is believed to be being held in a detention centre in her home city of Changsha, in central China on suspicion of “inciting separatism”. The charge is being widely used to convict Tibetans and Uyghurs as part of Beijing’s escalating crackdown on separatist movements. If found guilty, Zhang faces a prison sentence of up to 15 years. Kalsang Yarphel says her arrest came as a big shock. “It’s really hard,” he says. “My head is burning.” Sign up to  Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion Ginger Duan, founder of CYST and a close friend of Zhang, says she might have felt a sense of security travelling to Tibetan parts of China as a young Chinese student who has never had any hostile encounters with the authorities. She had travelled through Tibetan regions previously without any trouble. “I don’t think she expected this heavy charge, because we [at the newsletter and CYST] are not advocating for separatism. I don’t want her to be in jail for nothing,” says Duan, who added that although the group has been targeted by authorities in the past, no contributor had ever been detained. Zhang spoke about wanting Chinese people to better understand Tibetan culture and identity. “We [at CYST] would like to hold more discussions between Tibetans and Han Chinese people, so that the two sides can hear each other’s voices. I think this is so important,” she said, in a recording made in May and shared with the Guardian by friends shortly before she went to China. Yicheng Huang, who was teaching Zhang the Tibetan language online, says activists outside China should have done more to prioritise her safety. “She’s very young,” he says. “She always had passion and ideas, always was courageous. And she believed in Buddhism. She didn’t realise how dangerous it was.” Not long before Zhang’s arrest and disappearance, the  , who as Tibetan Buddhism’s spiritual leader has long been a thorn in the side of Beijing’s attempts to suppress Tibetan identity, celebrated his 90th birthday. In an act of defiance against China, he announced to Tibetan monks and leaders that he planned to remain in the role until he died, after which his   (the child in whom Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama’s spirit is reborn). Beijing has insisted that the choice of the next Dalai Lama lies only with China, and has even enshrined this claim in Chinese law.

Zhang was due to begin graduate studies in anthropology at   University of London this month, and her friends say she aspired to work in the field of human rights.

My father, Ali Mustafa,   and disappeared. Since that day, we have had no word, no trace, nothing. Every morning since he was taken I made my first thought after waking up: “He is alive.” Every night I went to sleep repeating it. My father’s arrest meant that our lives as we knew them were over as well. My family and I had to flee our country in fear for our safety, leaving him behind. Since then I have held on to the belief that if I allowed myself to mourn his loss it would mean I had accepted he was dead. We had no way of knowing whether this was true or not; to grieve without truth felt like a betrayal. So instead of grief, there was just absence. Years later, I learned that this is what psychologists call “ambiguous loss”. It is the most painful kind of loss because it never ends. When someone dies, there is a body, a burial, a ritual, a shared understanding that allows mourning to begin. But with the disappeared, there is nothing. No confirmation, no grave, no answers. You are trapped in this state of psychological limbo between hope and despair, unable to fully live in either. For all those years I really believed my father was alive. I felt it every single day. I carried his photo everywhere. I joined protests, campaigns, trials. I spoke in his name again and again. Hope was not just an emotion – it was a duty. This is what enforced disappearance does. It does not just take our loved ones. It steals our right to mourn them. For years I lived with the responsibility of fighting for my father’s life, and for all those who have disappeared. It felt like this might be my life forever – this unending struggle to find out the truth. . The Assad regime finally collapsed and the prisons were opened. Thousands of families rushed to see if they would be reunited with their loved ones. I went there too, from prison to prison, to find my father but he was nowhere. I am left with only silence. Since then I have been unable to let go. How can I look back at the past 12 years of my life and make sense of what I went through? How can I mourn my father without seeing his body or having something tangible to say farewell to? For all those years it felt too early to grieve. Now it feels too late. That moment of farewell was stolen from us, hidden behind prison walls. The fall of the Assad regime should have brought answers but to so many families of Syria’s disappeared, it has only brought a new kind of absence. We ask for names, for lists, for truth. We are given nothing. No answers, no records, no acknowledgment. I find myself asking questions that never end. Was my father alive last year? Last month? Did he know we were searching for him? Did he die alone? Did anyone speak his name in those final moments? These questions eat away at me. They stop me from letting him go and they stop me from living. This is not only my story. It is the story of tens of thousands of families in Syria. Since 2011 there are more than   by the Syrian Network for Human Rights, with 180,000 missing in all. Behind each one is a family stuck in the same limbo. The first thing that the interim government in Syria must do is to end enforced disappearance and unlawful detention, and stop the sectarian violence and the divisive rhetoric that fuels it. Start focusing on achieving the truth, justice and peace that we need to move our country forward. Through the new National Commission for the Missing, that means addressing disappearances by all parties without discrimination, protecting evidence and data, and ensuring families and survivors are not just consulted but are leading this process. Only an inclusive, independent and victim-centred commission can start to restore trust. As for the international community: the revolution and war in Syria and then the genocide in Gaza have stripped away the last illusions about what the world will do for us. Their inaction and complicity speak for themselves. But we must understand that our struggle does not depend on them. It depends on us – on the families who carry photos of the disappeared, on the survivors who keep telling their stories, on our refusal to forget or be silenced. Justice begins here, with our memory, our voices and our demand that the crimes never be repeated. Until the truth of my father’s fate is known – and until every family in Syria has the same truth – grief will remain unfinished but our fight for justice will not end.", "tags": ["syria", "rights", "and", "freedom", "bashar", "al-assad", "human", "rights", "torture", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "prisons", "comment"]},

Haddad Musaied, a local journalist, got a call from a friend telling him about the destruction and encouraging him to come and see it. “As a journalist, you have a responsibility to stop what is happening,” the friend said. But once at the scene in Tarim’s Aydid area, Musaied could only record with his camera the disintegration of the once marvellous palace, which had endured storms and even war over the decades. “It was heartbreaking to see Tarim’s history and legacy being quietly destroyed,” Musaied says. Musaied uploaded his images on social media. His film shows about half of the magnificent palace in ruins, revealing the interiors, including exquisite roofs, whitewashed columns and wooden windows. “Other countries would have preserved it, even if it were only 30 years old,” he says. Sheikh al-Kaf’s home was one of 30 mud-brick palaces in Tarim, attracting many visitors to the city. It was built between the world wars by affluent members of the al-Kaf family, traders who acquired their money in Singapore during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Mohammed al-Kaf, the palace’s owner, blamed the Yemeni government for failing to finance repairs and said neighbours had complained about the state of the building and possible damage to nearby residences should it collapse. “I blame the government for not supporting us in maintaining the palace,” al-Kaf says. The Tarim buildings are unique, mud-brick and colourful, and notable for combining Yemeni Hadrami architecture with south-east Asian influences, according to Ahmed al-Rubaki of the Al-Ranad Foundation for Cultural Development, which advocates for preservation. “Builders, decorators, sculptors, painters, carpenters and other artisans contributed their skills to the creation of magnificent palaces,” Rubaki says.

In recognition of its rich cultural legacy, the Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( ) named Tarim the capital of Islamic culture in 2010, sparking a short-lived campaign by the Yemeni government to repaint and restore some monuments. In August, for its cultural significance, Tarim was added to Yemen’s Unesco world heritage tentative list, a precursor to consideration for the world heritage list. As with other historical sites across Yemen, the palaces of Tarim have suffered from  , leaving them abandoned and unmaintained. Al-Kaf’s palace is the most prominent, but not the first to be demolished; some have already been replaced with modern concrete buildings. Hamtut palace, rising dramatically in one of Tarim’s densely populated neighbourhoods, with arched verandas, ornate columns and a symmetrical facade, is also owned by the al-Kaf family. On the verge of collapse, with erosion visible in the walls, the land around it has been marked out with land delineation stones, indicating portions have been sold, increasing worries for its future. “If these palaces collapse, Tarim’s history will be lost, as they are the city’s last remaining living monuments,” Musaied says. War closed Al-Quba Palace, another mud-brick landmark bearing visible scars of years of neglect and exposure. It had been repurposed as a hotel, but part of its walls have crumbled, replaced by a rusted, sagging wire fence; its swimming pool is cracked and empty. Ahmed Bahamalah, a representative of the General Authority for Antiquities and Museums, a government body responsible for handling Yemen’s historic sites, acknowledges the crisis, saying that most of Tarim’s mud-brick mansions are in a “dilapidated state” and at risk of collapse. Bahamalah says his office, like other cash-strapped government departments, has no resources to buy, lease or restore the palaces. Their primary role, he says, is to report updates about the properties to higher authorities and advocate for their preservation. “We, like other government bodies struggling with limited resources, are working hard to preserve what can still be saved – by reporting to the concerned authorities and anyone who might help,” he says.", "tags": ["global", "development", "yemen", "heritage", "architecture", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "features"]},

She lives a few kilometres from a copper foundry operated by the British-headquartered mining company Anglo American in Catemu, a town in central  . Every morning and evening, she says, the air is filled with a faint blue smoke. “It irritates your throat and makes you cough,” Silva says, remembering a day when her son Cristián, then three years old, began to have convulsions. “His face turned purple and he couldn’t breathe. He still has a red mark on his face from that episode.” Cristián has a respiratory allergy, controlled by daily medication, that his doctor believes is caused by his environment. His older brother, Roberto, has had asthma since he was a baby. “The contamination is terrible,” says Silva, blaming the company. Allegations of environmental breaches by   are frequent in Chile, where areas near the company’s operations are often called “sacrifice zones” by local communities because of human health problems, animal deaths and water shortages. The criticism is also based on conclusions by Chilean health authorities. In 2019, the government declared that particle pollutants in Catemu’s air  . It also warned of very high sulphur dioxide levels – although within legal limits. An   showed that emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particle pollutants from Anglo American’s Chagres foundry were significantly higher than any other industry in the town. Between 2018 and 2020, the level of particle pollutants in the air in the area where the foundry is based far exceeded the permitted level. After complaints, the government announced a decontamination plan for Catemu, but it has not been carried out. In 2022, Chile’s controller general’s office, which is responsible for fiscal and legal oversight of the public sector, noted high rates of respiratory illnesses among adults in Catemu and instructed the health ministry to conduct a study. The results have not been published. Meanwhile, doubts about air quality persist. Silva’s aunt, Rosa Neira, a teacher at the nearby San José school, observes the blue smoke clouds drifting toward the school each morning. She lives with obstructive bronchitis and says 60 of the school’s 158 pupils, aged between five and 14 years old, missed days in this year’s first term as a result of respiratory illnesses. “It’s beautiful here,” she says, pointing to hills dotted with green shrubs. “But living here harms our health. I use an inhaler every day. As soon as I retire, I will leave, but I worry for the children left behind.” Anglo American says it respects Chilean environmental standards, arguing that progress has been made, and notes a 2020-2022 ministry of health study showing that rates of respiratory diseases and tumours in Catemu are similar to or lower than in other cities in the Valparaíso region. “Chagres is recognised for operating under the highest environmental standards among smelters in the country,” the company states, adding that it has invested in flue-gas treatment plants that “have reduced particulate matter emissions by 18%, fully complying with current regulations”. et, it is not just Anglo American’s foundry that has been blamed for contaminating the environment in Chile. The company also operates two large copper mines and 12 tailings dams in the country, as well as having a share in a third copper mine. Small farmers near Anglo American’s El Soldado mine in Valparaíso say the company releases water from its El Torito tailings dam to prevent overflow, causing problems downstream. Victor Vargas Caberra, part of a 1,700-member farming community in El Melón, says that each year some of their cows and goats die after drinking from streams. He also sees dead fish, rabbits, ducks and other birds. “The water in the river and our wells is toxic. We can’t drink it or use it to wash. If you fill up a bottle, the water is a horrible yellow colour,” he says. The farmers also say grey dust blows from the mining operations and settles on their plants and the windowpanes of their homes. Several have health problems and want the authorities to investigate. Luis Acevedo, the president of the El Melón farmers’ association, says: “We’re living in a sacrifice zone. Anglo American has polluted the water and the air we breathe.” Anglo American says it “does not endanger the health of people or animals” and “controls the quality of surface and groundwater” in accordance with Chilean legislation and international environmental standards. The company has been charged with environmental non-compliance failures at the mines it operates, El Soldado and Los Bronces. In 2020, Chile’s environmental authority found that discharges from El Torito dam had   in the local El Cobre River. In December 2024, the environmental regulator charged Anglo American with   at El Soldado mine, including deficiencies in drainage and water infiltration management. The authority also fined the company for   at the mine in 2014. hile has suffered several droughts in the last 15 years, but farmers – who face severe water shortages – and residents also blame Anglo American for buying up the rights to use local water. Between 2022 and 2024,   for water-use irregularities in the Valparaíso region. In July, the Valparaíso water regulator fined the company for unauthorised water extraction that affected 5,000 people. The regulator asked prosecutors to investigate whether a crime punishable by prison was committed. The company denies taking unauthorised water from this location and says it will take legal steps to reverse the decision. Anglo American’s largest mine in Chile, Los Bronces, is 40 miles (65km) from the capital, Santiago. The mine’s waste is transported through an ore slurry pipeline to Las Tórtolas tailings dam 35 miles away. Residents of Huertos Familiares, who live near the dam, report water shortages and contamination. It used to be a community of smallholders but now, because there is not enough water, only one farmer in the village, Luis Pérez Orostegui, still cultivates crops. Pérez uses just 2 hectares (5 acres) of his 52-hectare farm for planting because the ground is so dry. “There’s a lack of rain, but the mine is also using up the water,” he says, adding that he has to migrate to work on a farm in another region. The environmental regulator   for ecological infractions at Los Bronces and filed  the mine in December last year, including a failure to control seepage from Las Tórtolas dam and an ongoing failure to manage acid drainage from its Donoso waste deposit. Anglo American says: “In 2022, Los Bronces and El Soldado mining operations and the Chagres smelter were awarded the Copper Mark in recognition of responsible copper production practices.” The company also says that it has developed compliance plans to address the new charges and those made against its El Soldado mine. Authorities are now reviewing the plans. Anglo American – which recently   with Canada’s Teck Resources to create Anglo Teck, in   – has won approval to expand the Los Bronces mine, despite Chile’s environmental authority raising concerns this   and damage glaciers in the central Andes. These glaciers are vital water sources for Santiago and have significantly retreated over 60 years. The plan involves mining underneath the protected Yerba Loca nature reserve, which contains several glaciers. The company has already built an exploratory five mile  . Anglo American also plans to transport 48m tonnes of toxic waste through a 25-mile pipeline via mountains from an old dam near Los Bronces to the Las Tórtolas tailings facility, 25 miles from Santiago. Anglo American says the plan was “evaluated by the authorities and received environmental approval”. Yet Cristóbal Rodríguez, a campaigner for the water rights group  , along with several associations, is challenging the plan and asking for a new, independent impact study. “This is an earthquake zone,” Rodríguez says. “Moving thousands of tonnes of toxic waste through the mountains to a dam not far from the capital could lead to an environmental disaster.”", "tags": ["mining", "southern", "frontlines:", "latin", "america", "and", "the", "caribbean", "chile", "anglo", "american", "pollution", "americas", "features"]},

He takes a wrong turn and runs into bandits. Back home, his father flicks through TV channels while his mother counts bags of flour. No one speaks. The silence is broken only by crackles on the radio. By evening, Baraka is sitting on the shore of Lake Kivu, looking south to Bukavu and east towards Rwanda, finding no hope in either direction. This is the opening to Baraka and the Unpredictable Life of Goma, the first comic by a 31-year-old visual artist, Edizon Musavuli, published earlier this year in the Continent, a weekly pan-African newspaper. The story depicts everyday struggles in Goma through the eyes of a child. Prominent Congolese artists such as Barly Baruti, Fifi Mukuna and Papa Mfumu’Eto, who captured the public’s imagination in comic strips in the past, mainly worked abroad or in Kinshasa, a city more than a thousand miles from Goma. But there are few contemporary comics set in or about the   written by Congolese artists. “I have been drawing since I could hold a pencil,” Musavuli says of his journey as an artist. He began to pursue the craft seriously only after finishing high school, enrolling at the Africa Digital Media Institute in Nairobi. His studies, however, were cut short by financial difficulties. His first solo exhibition was in January 2020, organised with the French Institute of Goma. “It was a really big exhibition. [And] it was impressive how everyone responded to it,” says Musavuli. But just a year later, the  , resurfaced in eastern DRC and upended Goma’s fragile art scene. “Artists in Goma are really reliant on French exhibitions like that,” he says. “If they’re not around, it will feel like we don’t exist. That’s what’s happening right now.” When   in January this year, the city’s creative spaces faltered alongside its economy. “Art gives hope. It’s something to start with, but our situation here doesn’t change. So people [in Goma] are not really interested any more,” says Musavuli. Artists and creativity have long been consigned to the margins of the state agenda. “We are not really something the government prioritises,” he says. Turning to Instagram, he began sharing personal and collective experiences of Congolese life in the form of cartoons. In one post, recounting his childhood, he captioned an interactive story: “I’m from where you learn to run before you walk.” In one reel, which has since generated more than 10,000 views, he is seen working on an unfinished painting, while gunshots are heard in the background. This article includes content provided by  Instagram . We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,   . It was against this backdrop that the Baraka and the Unpredictable Life of Goma was created. The story is charged with political undertones, highlighting how ordinary routines have been stripped away and replaced with constant uncertainty. Yet Musavuli insists the short comic was not meant as explicit political commentary: “I’m not really a political artist or activist [but] I say what people around me are thinking. That’s how I do my art.” Asked whether he feels able to express himself freely under occupation, he says: “There is freedom of speech in Congo, but will you be free after you speak?” Producing art that appears too critical of M23 or the government can be dangerous, he says: “In Kinshasa it’s normal to talk about everything that’s wrong with the rebels. But in Goma it’s normal to not do that because it’s not safe for you. “Politically, we are separated from the ‘actual’ Congo,” he says. Unlike other cities in the North and South Kivu provinces of the DRC, Goma remains under full  . “As an artist in Goma, the challenge in creating art now is to put out something that cannot be used by politicians for their propaganda,” he says. If insecurity is one challenge, making a living through the arts is another hurdle. “It’s a problem in Congo that people don’t buy art. Most of the artists here have to do other things to survive.” Musavuli works as a cartoonist for a blog site called Habari RDC. But he adds: “I’m also not doing art to just sell it.” Despite the risks and the financial uncertainties, Musavuli says he wants to continue creating work that gives voice to the disenfranchised people of Goma. “We are a resilient population – this is not the first time we have been through this. “We might not have power but not doing anything is so much worse. Even if your voice is heard by just two people, it’s something.” At the end of the Baraka and the Unpredictable Life of Goma, Baraka walks alone down an empty road, his head held high. “Tomorrow might look exactly the same,” he says, “but I’ll keep walking.

More than 6 million people have been affected, with nearly 1,000 killed, including 250 children, according to the  . Nearly  . Nawaz was asleep, alone with her three children as her husband was working away in the city, when the water started coming in to their house. “I rushed outside and then, when the water reached six feet, climbed on to the roof with my children,” Nawaz says. “That night and the following morning, we had nothing to eat. While on the rooftop, my little boy kept asking when we could go home downstairs, but our home was already submerged. The water had nearly reached the roof when rescue teams finally arrived the next afternoon to take us to the camps by boat, and it reached a maximum of 22 feet,” says Nawaz. Her youngest daughter, Aneesa, nine, now has symptoms that suggest she may have severe cholera. Most flood-affected people were accommodated in temporary camps hastily erected by the government. A lucky few have been able to stay with relatives or been taken in by host families in safer areas. But even as the water levels have receded, stagnant standing water and sewage contamination is proving a threat to those living in the camps where they have only basic cooking facilities and sanitation and limited access to clean drinking water. While there are no official figures for cholera in the region, doctors at public and private hospitals in Multan report a doubling of cholera and malaria cases since the floods.  , leading to overcrowded emergency wards. “There has been a surge in cases of cholera, diarrhoea, malaria and dengue, primarily among patients seeking treatment coming from the flood-affected camps. I was normally treating 40 to 50 patients daily, but now there are nearly 100 patients coming for gastro-related issues and treatment,” a doctor says on the condition of anonymity. The Multan area has a population of about 5 million and covers 3,720 sq km. Initial estimates indicate that the floods caused damage to up to 15% of homes. “The relief camps across Multan have facilitated 56,415 people,” a government official at the office of Additional Chief Secretary South Punjab says. “Six fixed medical clinics are working, while 28 clinics are on wheels.” But none of those the Guardian spoke to in three of the displacement camps had any access to medical facilities or had seen a doctor or nurse. According to the World   Organization (WHO), vector-borne diseases, primarily malaria, surged by 87% between June and August 2025, while cholera, along with eye infections and skin allergies, was on the rise in Pakistan after the floods although no immediate data was available. “When people are displaced and forced to rely on unfamiliar water sources, the likelihood of encountering contaminated water increases. Displaced people might turn to drinking from rivers or other unsafe water sources, increasing their risk of infection,” says Dr Qaiser Sajjad of the Pakistan Medical Association. People in the displacement camps complain of a lack of safe, private latrines or bathing facilities for women. Menstrual hygiene products are unavailable and the conditions leave women and girls vulnerable to harassment and sexual violence. Sumera Bibi, 25, says women feel afraid. She is battling a fever and skin allergies and says she has received no medical care. “We need proper medical attention, and the presence of a doctor is essential.

From burns and blast wounds to lost limbs and fractured bones, Gaza’s hospitals have been overwhelmed by patients in profound pain. But a   means there is little doctors can do to help. Treatment and operations need to be carried out without proper anaesthetics, and what painkillers there are have to be rationed. According to analysis by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ), more than half of the WHO’s medical missions into Gaza since January 2024 – including the delivery of medicines and fuel for hospitals, the deployment of staff and patient evacuations – have been denied, delayed, impeded or cancelled. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have bombed storage facilities  , while international convoys of medical supplies are routinely blocked from entering Gaza or face weeks of delays at the border. TBIJ spoke to eight doctors in Gaza who described the dire shortfall in pain relief drugs including opioids, anaesthetics, and even paracetamol. “Most injuries are amputations or open fractures,” says orthopaedic doctor Abdelkareem Alsalqawi. “These are severely painful and require 24-hour painkillers. [But now] we tell them: one injection per day … use it at night so you can sleep.” In July, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the country would be allowing  . But aid agencies and doctors working in the territory report a near-total collapse of the medical supply chain. “It is very clear that since March, we have spent months without allowing anything to enter,” says Dr Randa Abu Rabe of the WHO’s office for the occupied Palestinian territory. “It is not only the medication: it is the reagent, the diagnostics, some of the instruments or equipment.” The Israeli government’s Coordinator of the Government Activities in the Territories (Cogat) says: “Israel allows and facilitates the entry of medical equipment and medicines, subject to prior coordination. As evidence, in recent weeks alone, more than 3,500 tons of medical equipment have been transferred.” This is disputed by aid groups and doctors experiencing acute shortages. They say shipments are delayed for weeks or months at the border and requests are ignored. Israel has never published a definitive official list of barred items but circulates shifting lists to international agencies. Tania Hary, director of the legal centre Gisha, says shortages are aggravated by the collapse of secure delivery systems inside Gaza. “In addition to restrictions [at the border], the breakdown in public order and looting has created barriers to getting aid in, including expensive and sensitive items like medicines and medical equipment,” Hary says. “The lack of availability cannot always be pinned neatly on restrictions at entry, but rather on barriers to distribution created by a host of factors – almost all of which can be traced to Israel’s conduct of the war and its policy on access.” Travis Melin, a visiting US doctor in Gaza, says he is unable to understand the rationale behind drug restrictions. “Opioids are purely compassionate, they have no purpose other than compassionate care,” he says. “They don’t help you live longer, they don’t make you more likely to survive your injuries, they have no mortality benefit.” Opioids have become tightly rationed.   describe reducing patients to a single injection a day, leaving pain unalleviated for hours on end. Sign up to  Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion In operating rooms, morphine, normally administered as a single sterile vial per patient, is so limited that doctors must treat several people from the same vial – a practice that carries infection risks. Many opioids are classed as essential medicines by the WHO and their absence, doctors say, leaves patients and medical teams without the most reliable tools for managing acute pain and for allowing surgeons to work. Gaza doctors often rely on ketamine, an anaesthetic with hallucinogenic effects, which they call a “battlefield medication”. “If someone came in with an amputation, they would get an IV and then a dose of ketamine. It lasts about 45 minutes,” says Melin. “But giving it as a single dose, with the workforce here, is not feasible. And you can’t keep people [dosed with ketamine]. They can’t stand up, they can’t walk around, they can’t interact. So that’s not a safe option either.” When it is available, doctors carry syringes pre-filled with ketamine for “mass casualty” events, when shelling brings in waves of patients, to inject small doses so that doctors can attend to them. Patients frequently emerge hallucinating or terrified. And it wears off. “Patients come into the ER and may or may not get a dose of ketamine. If they’re in pain but it’s not a catastrophic injury, they often won’t get anything,” says Melin. “For a severe injury or a procedure like inserting a chest tube, they’ll probably be given ketamine. But for something like a simple gunshot wound, most people are just toughing it out.” Asked to comment, the Israeli government spokesperson said the Israel Defense Forces “will continue to act in order to facilitate medical care and the ongoing operation of medical institutions in the Gaza Strip, in cooperation with international aid organisations”.", "tags": ["global", "development", "gaza", "palestine", "hospitals", "doctors", "israel-gaza", "war", "health", "features"]},

The food has been cooked on-site and is free for everyone, part of India’s ambitious “midday meal” –   – programme to incentivise school enrolment. The scheme covers more than 1m state-run schools across the country, but the menu at Laitsohpliah is hyperlocal, thanks to a recent charity initiative in the state. A lunch of rice, dal, potatoes with east Himalayan chives, cured dry fish and  , a wild berry pickle This lunchtime, apart from the staple rice and dal, there is a dish of potatoes with east Himalayan chives, cured dry fish and  , a wild berry pickle. Much of it has been sourced from local farmers, including parents of the pupils, while the rest has been grown in the school’s kitchen garden. “Our students don’t like skipping meals any more,” says the headteacher, Nestar Kharmawphlang, who has taught at the school for 30 years. Across the remote state of Meghalaya – originally part of Assam and home to the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo communities – fresh, locally sourced ingredients such as millet, fruit and wild greens are used to supplement the carbohydrate-heavy fare of rice, lentils and the occasional egg that dominate the programme’s menus. The shift is courtesy of an initiative by the  , which aims to make school lunches healthier, more sustainable and climate-resilient. Since 2022, Laitsohpliah has been one of 26 government-run schools in the state where lunches are transforming children’s appetites and energy levels through the use of locally grown and nutrient-rich ingredients. The school’s headteacher, Nestar Kharmawphlang, in his kitchen garden East Himalayan chives and cured fish add nutritional value to the children’s food Experts say the model is promising because while the government scheme, launched in 1995, has aimed to provide free, nutritious meals to its poorest children, its   by budget constraints and other challenges in a country where more than   and more than a third are stunted. “The results would need more independent scrutiny,” says Reetika Khera, a development economist who teaches at Delhi’s Indian Institute of Technology. “But in principle, decentralisation initiatives like these can reduce costs, ensure fresher produce and better nutrition.” The local government in Meghalaya has taken note too, inviting the charity to train more than 7,000 school cooks with the aim of diversifying menus using indigenous foods. Back at the school in Laitsohpliah, the cook serves lunch through a window of the school’s cramped kitchen. At another local school, rice is served with dal, tomato salad mixed with wild edible leaves, lemon slices, and a cauliflower and vegetable gravy Iarap Bor Lang Khongsit waits for his lunch at the kitchen window; and Offiliana Syiemlieh shows off her food In the queue with his friends, 10-year-old Iarap Bor Lang Khongsit says he “loves the food at school”, and his favourite dish is   made with finely chopped fiddlehead ferns and turmeric. Millet, once disliked by many of the children, is now baked in cakes or brewed into a thick tea; grated carrot salads have sesame seeds, salt, onion and  perilla seeds); potato cheese balls are made with chives; and dal is enriched with local pulses such as rice beans, similar to mung beans.

Eight months pregnant, she has had just three of the five antenatal appointments she should have had. She is unlikely to attend her final three either, as she still has to save 3,000 kwacha (£1.28) for a bicycle to take her six miles on rutted dirt tracks to the nearest health centre when she goes into labour. In remote villages in Malawi, pregnant women such as 22-year-old Banda, who has one child after losing her first soon after giving birth, are struggling to get the medical care they need. In January, US aid cuts abruptly ended a rural healthcare outreach programme that was starting to reduce the number of local women dying in childbirth. , a five-year $28m (£20m) programme aimed at cutting maternal and infant mortality rates in five of Malawi’s 28 districts, was meant to last until 2027.

There is no piped water or electricity, and a bridge across the steep-banked river that divides it from the nearest health centre was washed away last December. A mobile clinic used to visit the community every month or so, providing a private space for women to get screening for cervical and other cancers, HIV tests and treatment, and vaccinations for children. It also provided antenatal checkups and family-planning services, including contraception. “The outreach clinics were helping a lot, because we could access services right here in the village,” Mulirani Gerard says through a translator. “Since last year, we had been waiting for the team to come, so we were just wondering what had happened.” No one told villagers why their healthcare had been cut. Gerard says she has not been too badly affected, as she has a contraceptive implant that lasts for three years, but that others were not so lucky. “It’s a challenge, because this has led to unintended pregnancies,” the 25-year-old says, pointing to her friend Banda, as they sit in the shade with other mothers as children play around them. Juliette Kannda, a 31-year-old mother of three, had been receiving bi-monthly contraceptive injections.

An   in April estimated that US aid will fall 59% this year, cutting 1% off Malawi’s GDP. The government had little means to make up the shortfall. Malawi’s fiscal deficit (the gap between government expenditure and revenue) was 10.1% in the year to 31 March. In any case, its attempts to win back voters with election-year spending failed, with Lazarus Chakwera losing to Peter Mutharika in elections on 16 September. Funding healthcare in Malawi “is indeed the duty of the government, but … the government doesn’t have the resources,” says Hester Nyasulu, Malawi director for Amref   Africa, a organisation that was one of seven backing the Momentum Tikweze Umoyo project. The funding cuts should have been a “transitional process”, he says, adding: “We were starting to reap the benefits of the investment … The termination of the   [funds] … will definitely lead to more deaths of pregnant and lactating women and also newborns.” Between January 2022 and December 2024, maternal mortality rates in clinics and hospitals had fallen in three of the five districts covered by the project, according to data provided by Nyasulu. More children were vaccinated, treated for malaria and had their nutrition monitored, and more women received family planning services and first-trimester antenatal care, while  .

The vehicles and staff were provided by the health ministry, with fuel and staff lunches paid for by USAID. At the health centre in Makioni, a small market town about 34 miles from the district capital, breastfeeding guides painted on the wall were branded: “USAID: from the American people”. Staff there lament how pregnant women are having antenatal appointments later or not at all and the drop in screenings for cervical cancer. Two women aged 18 and 20 survived unsafe abortions, which they had undergone because they lived 17 miles from the clinic, staff say. “It’s increased the workload in the [health] facilities, hence the poor quality of services being provided,” says Yohane Billiat, district family-planning coordinator. Samuel Chawaka, the Makioni health centre manager, says: “We are failing to give them services in their place.” A US state department spokesperson said: “The US government supports life-saving assistance in Malawi, including approximately $160m to support efforts to address HIV, TB, malaria and other critical health risks. “America continues to be the most generous nation in the world. It is imperative to remember that the American taxpayer was never meant to bear the full burden of taking care of every person on Earth – whether that be with food, medicine or otherwise.” However, even in Malawi’s cities the quality of healthcare is falling. In Lilongwe, the US previously funded the training of health workers to find and manage cases of tuberculosis (TB). There has subsequently been a fall in the number of cases detected and referred for treatment, says Thoms Chigeda, the district TB coordinator. “If people are not being diagnosed early enough, it will be difficult for them to get cured,” he says, “and drug-resistant TB can also flourish. We had made some strides in the TB fight in the district, but because of this I think we might be losing the battle.” Before the US aid cuts, 11,000 babies were immunised every month, says Maclean Nkhoma, the city’s immunisation coordinator. Now it is fewer than 9,000, and the infant immunisation rate has fallen from 98% to 85%, he says. “They [the US] have been supporting us; they have to continue. Because otherwise whatever happens in Malawi or in Africa, like outbreaks, will also affect them,” Nkhoma says. “If Africa is protected, that means the whole world is protected.”", "tags": ["global", "development", "aid", "cuts", "aid", "global", "health", "usaid", "trump", "administration", "us", "foreign", "policy", "maternal", "health", "features"]},

But by mid-afternoon, the family were instead preparing for a funeral – both Fatima and her baby were dead. The family say they do not follow international news, but Fatima’s death can be directly traced back to decisions taken weeks earlier, thousands of miles away, in Washington DC. Fatima lived in the village of Dhubay’ah, in eastern Yemen’s al-Masilah district. At the entrance to the village, where goats and camels wander freely, rusting signs bear the logos of international organisations, evidence of sporadic aid efforts in the area. Women marry young – some in their early teens – and have large families. According to the local health centre, there are now 56 pregnant women among the village’s 171 households. Becoming pregnant in Yemen can be risky. The country has a high maternal death rate: one woman dies in pregnancy or childbirth every two hours,  . About   die from pregnancy-related causes for every 100,000 live births. In the UK, the figure is eight. When Fatima’s labour pains began on 25 May, her parents took her to the nearby al-Eis health clinic. “I kept telling her, ‘you must be near the doctor, because if anything happens, it’s better for it to happen there,’” recalls her mother. Fatima had already needed a blood transfusion late in her pregnancy. “When we finally took her to the doctor, everything was fine – she was even walking on her own.” Fatima was seen by midwives, and then by Reem, the unit’s doctor. “When she arrived, she was in pain but was responsive and communicative,” Reem says. “The foetal heartbeat was stable and her vital signs were normal.” By midday, Fatima’s cervix was fully dilated and she was moved to a delivery bed. But something was wrong – the baby’s heartbeat was slowing and it had not moved farther down the birth canal. Fatima told staff: “I feel like I will not be able to give birth. I feel abnormal and the heat is unbearable.” Reem contacted the nearest hospital in Sayhut, a 10-minute drive away, because it looked likely that a caesarean section would be needed. Al-Eis does not have the facilities to deal with obstetric emergencies. But the hospital in Sayhut said it could not accept her. The medical staff at al-Eis cannot recall the reasons given but Fatima’s family say they were told it was because there was not enough diesel to run the generator. Sayhut’s emergency obstetric services had been reliant on funding from the US government via the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which was abruptly  . The cuts left Sayhut hospital short of the medicines, fuel and the medical personnel needed to treat emergencies. Dr Saeed Mubarak, the hospital director, said in a statement to the Guardian: “UNFPA’s support for emergency obstetric services at Sayhut hospital had stopped. We are unable to provide emergency obstetric care, nor surgical services or caesarean operations during this period.” At about midday, in al-Eis clinic, the baby’s heartbeat had increased after oxygen was given, but Fatima and her unborn child needed more advanced care. With Sayhut hospital not an option, Reem decided to send them in an ambulance to al-Raidah hospital, an hour and a half away. Fatima’s mother sat in the front of the ambulance next to the driver. “At first, everything was fine; we gave her IV fluids and she improved,” Fatima’s mother says. “Because of the heat, we stopped at a small shop to buy her juice, and I saw her regain her strength after drinking it. We never expected that death could come so suddenly.” In the back of the ambulance, the senior midwife, Sarah, saw sudden signs of danger. “Her abdomen had enlarged,” she says. “Her face became pale, her lips and mouth showed signs of paleness – indications of internal bleeding. “I observed these signs when we were halfway along the rough and uneven road. We thought the jolting might have caused these symptoms.” As they reached the next district, Fatima fell unconscious. Sarah checked her vital signs, but felt no pulse. “I knew she was in her last moments,” she says. “I held her on my lap and asked the paramedic with me to recite the   [Islamic profession of faith] for her, whispering: ‘I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.’ When we arrived at al-Raidah, she had already passed. “The feeling was indescribable; we were all in shock. I was the first to leave the ambulance, to notify them that Fatima had died on the way.” She had suffered a uterine rupture, when the womb tears open during labour and massive bleeding follows. They are more common in women who, like Fatima, had had a previous caesarean section. Her cousin and brother-in-law, Omar, had followed the ambulance with other family members, including a relative prepared to donate blood should she need it. “It was a tremendous shock,” he says, adding that the loss hit Fatima’s husband hard. “Despite his attempts to appear strong, the pain is clear on him. His behaviour has changed and he is still living with the bitterness of loss and shock. “We share this pain with him and see it in his silence and isolation – clear signs of deep grief. He has not yet reached a stage of healing, as the shock still overwhelms him, because of what Fatima meant to him.” Her daughters, aged five and six, tell playmates that their mother had to take their baby brother to God. Fatima was the oldest of her siblings, the youngest of whom is four years old and loved her as a second mother, Omar says. “Fatima was one of the kindest women we knew, both as a cousin and as a sister-in-law.” Her other brother was on his way from Saudi Arabia, and the family were unable to reach him to tell him what had happened. He arrived home before the ambulance carrying his sister’s body had arrived. “When he entered, the house was crowded with women. At that moment, he must have thought they had gathered to welcome him home after his time abroad, not to mourn his sister. One can only imagine the shock he felt when he realised the truth – from a moment of joy to a moment of crushing sorrow,” says Omar. It is hard, he says, to understand why Sayhut hospital had been unable to accept Fatima. “How could they not have fuel to run the ambulance or the essential equipment? If the reason they couldn’t admit her was the lack of diesel, then that is a major catastrophe. And if there were other reasons, the responsibility falls on the concerned authorities.” Might Fatima have lived, had Sayhut been an option? “Sometimes the thought crosses our mind,” Omar says. “[But] we believe in Allah’s will and decree, and we know that no soul is taken except at its appointed time.” Reem is more blunt. “A shorter transfer time could have saved her life,” she says. “When [the midwife] told me, I was shocked and cried. “As women, we put ourselves in her place. She left behind two daughters – it’s truly tragic. A mother’s departure is not just the loss of children or a husband, but the disintegration of an entire family. It’s very difficult, a soul is lost.” Reem comes from a city in a neighbouring province, and has been shocked at the lack of healthcare available in the area since she arrived seven months ago. Where there are facilities, they lack basic drugs and equipment or even fully trained staff. “I did not expect such conditions in my own country,” she says. Dhubay’ah village is fortunate to be relatively close to medical facilities. Some people in the valleys of Al-Mahrah may live 12 hours away from healthcare, Reem says. “These 12 hours are not all by car; some parts involve walking for about three hours from one area to another. During Eid al-Adha [festival], there was a pregnant patient with a fever who had been carried on a blanket by men for about three hours.” Sarah, a midwife for 17 years, says women in remote communities with signs of complications to their pregnancy can “remain untreated for days – sometimes up to three days – and tragically, some pass away” due to a lack of transport. Understanding the risks in pregnancy, such as high blood pressure, is another challenge, she says. “Unfortunately, this lack of awareness has worsened, especially given the harsh living conditions. Women often say, ‘I will endure this for the sake of my children. If I get the money tomorrow, I’ll seek treatment.’” Sarah would like to see greater efforts to raise awareness of health problems, such as through mosques and religious leaders, and more fully trained midwives in rural areas. “Support from organisations is essential,” she says. “Even minimal support can make a significant difference.” The UNFPA’s contract to support reproductive health in Yemen was among thousands halted once   was shut down. The organisation had anticipated some loss of funding under Trump, due to longstanding and false Republican claims that it participated in programmes of coerced abortion. But the scale and speed was “unprecedented”, says Andrew Saberton, a deputy executive director at UNFPA, speaking from its New York headquarters. The US government terminated 45 grants to UNFPA, totalling $336m (£250m), the majority of which were “humanitarian and life-saving in nature”, the UNFPA says. “No administration had previously closed ongoing agreements that the previous administration had signed,” says Saberton. US funding had covered 60% of UNFPA’s humanitarian work in Yemen. The in-country team had to make “heartbreaking” decisions rapidly, Saberton says. “Nearly 1.5 million women have lost access to life-saving services, and 300,000 have lost access to prevention and treatment for gender-based violence. Support to 44 health facilities, 10 safe spaces for women, one mental health centre and 14 mobile health and protection teams have now ceased.” The US administration has repeatedly denied that aid cuts have caused any deaths. Three days before Fatima died, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, repeatedly   as a result of aid cuts. Saberton says that cannot be true. Governments insisted, in return for funding, on detailed reports on how many maternal deaths would be avoided, he says. “They wanted the good news. Well, the opposite is true, too. We will do less with less – there is no way of plugging that gap, it is too big a crisis, and when that funding is cut, lives will be lost.” Saberton points out that it was not just the US making cuts to overseas development aid. The UK and other countries have also reduced spending on aid. The UNFPA has identified another two pregnant women in Yemen’s Hajjah governorate who died in May en route to emergency care, after clinics closer to home were left unable to help them because of cuts. Enshrah Ahmed, UNFPA representative in Yemen, says: “[Fatima’s] entirely preventable death was a direct consequence of funding cuts. “Unfortunately, she didn’t have the time to reach the next available care that could have saved her life. Unless funding is forthcoming, this tragedy will be repeated, countless times over.”", "tags": ["maternal", "health", "aid", "cuts", "global", "health", "yemen", "women's", "health", "aid", "usaid", "health", "features"]},

Shoes, winter coats, shampoo bottles and sheets lay strewn around: belongings the 30 refugee women and five children living there had worked hard to acquire, and would now have to abandon. The next day, the shelter would be shuttered for good. “I was so stressed I couldn’t sleep,” says Oksana Kutko, a Ukrainian. “I knew I had nowhere to go.” Operated by   since 2020, the shelter’s closure came as a shock. Kutko, 51, had been living there for three years after fleeing Russian bombs in Kharkiv. She hauled what she could carry to a nearby church. Residents could not find alternative accommodation in the short time they were given to leave. A Congolese woman with a seven-year-old son simply laid out a sheet on the pavement outside. By evening, everyone had vacated the refuge, except for one woman. Évodie*, a woman in her 20s who fled severe sexual abuse and violence in the Republic of the Congo, refused to leave. For days after the other women had gone, Évodie clung to the place: the last semblance of stability in her life of uncertainty. Already in a fragile mental and emotional state, losing her place at the shelter cast her back into memories of horrific abuse. Eventually, the police evicted Évodie. She spent the next month homeless. The shelter’s closure is the new reality brought by governments’ overseas aid funding cuts, people with fragile lives being left without lifelines, struggling to stay afloat. “These women’s need for a safe place, their need for hope for the future, their need to heal the past – all these things are connected,” says Thaleia Portokaloglou, a psychologist who knows Évodie from the   an organisation for refugee women in Athens. As support is withdrawn, Portokaloglou is seeing women unravel. How do you ask a person pulled apart like that to keep functioning, she asks. The closure of the Mitsaki Street shelter can be traced back to 20 January 2025, when President   budget hours after his inauguration. Contracts with humanitarian organisations were terminated and over the following months support networks in many countries, including Greece, were gutted; METAdrasi lost a third of its budget, resulting in the shelter’s closure. Greece has received  . The wait to be granted asylum can take years, leaving many people dependent on humanitarian organisations while their cases are being processed. European governments have also been steadily slashing their overseas aid budgets, diverging sharply from the postwar global consensus on humanitarian relief. Lefteris Papagiannakis, director of the Greek Council for  , says: “We are losing the whole of the international protection system that has been in place for the last 80 years in six months.” Meanwhile, Athens has hardened its stance on migration – parliament suspended asylum applications from north Africa in July and instigated   this month that could mean rejected asylum seekers receiving prison terms if they do not leave within 14 days. Around the world, humanitarian networks have been thrown into chaos. Dimitra Kalogeropoulou, director of the International Rescue Committee in  , says: “We are facing an unseen crisis where people are really suffering.” On 30 June, between walls hung with Afghan tapestries, officials from Greece’s migrant-support organisations held an emergency meeting at the Melissa Network. The NGO leaders were visibly shaken. Minutes earlier, they had left an interagency meeting of the Greek branch of the refugee agency, the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR). “All of us are facing an existential crisis,” says Nadina Christopoulou, director and co-founder of the Melissa Network. Before January, 90% of the UNHCR’s funding in Greece came from the US state department, says Papagiannakis. Now, half the funding and half the staff are gone. “Unfortunately, Europe is not stepping in,” he says. “They say, ‘Ah, that’s a good opportunity! We’ll stop too.’” The cuts mean aid organisations have been forced to make hard decisions. Funding for victims of sexual violence has been cut across the board. Christopoulou put it in simple terms: 970 asylum seekers would be stranded without assistance. At least 100 survivors of sexual violence would lose essential services, including emergency housing. Sign up to  Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion “People will no longer come to our centre because they feel it is undignified to come without having taken a shower, without having slept on a bed – and perhaps having been raped overnight,” Christopoulou says. “Because that’s what happens when you sleep in a park.” After her eviction from the METAdrasi shelter, Évodie slept rough in parks and squares for a month. Christopoulou knows from Évodie’s case worker, Irida, that homelessness plunged her into a devastating mental spiral. She has since found a space in a new refuge, but remains uncertain how long she will be able to stay there. When Évodie first came to Melissa in 2023, traumatised by her experiences in the Congo, she did not speak and, unable to find housing, spent nights in a park where she was further harassed. Eventually, Melissa secured a hostel place for her, before she moved into the METAdrasi refuge. Initially, she sat in a corner, without saying a word. It was a surprise, then, when she decided to join Melissa’s choir. On 8 March last year, Évodie stepped on stage and started to sing. Those in the audience who knew her were stunned. “I was crying,” Christiana Kyrkou, a project manager at the Melissa Network, says. “It was one of the first times I heard, loudly and clearly, her voice,” Christopoulou recalls. “Everybody was happy, but Évodie was Oscar happy!” Weekly self-defence training sessions offered a space for Évodie to open up. The class instructor, Konstantinos Koufaliotis, says she was his most frequent participant. One day, after Évodie mastered the basics, Koufaliotis taught her how to throw him to the ground. He landed on the foam mats with such a bang that Christopoulou rushed to the room asking if everything was OK. “Évodie laughed and laughed, because she created this,” Koufaliotis says. “She owned that moment.” Over the summer, she opened up to Koufaliotis about her difficulty in trusting those around her. When the conversations were too much for her, Koufaliotis would put up his boxing mitts and they would go back to training. Victims of sexual violence have every reason not to trust people. “Even if you do manage to get out of the circumstances that have created trauma, it’s such a fragile edifice,” Christopoulou says. “What you’re building is so fragile that it may easily fall apart into pieces again.” Now, as funding dries up, and services from therapy to housing face being wrenched away in an instant, hard-earned trust that NGOs have taken years to build up vanishes with it. The shelter’s closure left Évodie once again sees everything as a threat and everyone as an aggressor. She is distrustful of those trying to help her. Melissa’s staff believe this will be a commonplace reaction as since the funding cuts began, needs have turned from healing to survival. “There’s a shift from more psychological requests to more practical, more urgent ones,” Portokaloglou says. “We’re going back to those very primal, basic requests.” The prospect of future funding cuts now risks the survival of the whole Greek humanitarian network. The only certainty is that no programmes will be left unscathed. “It’s vertical, horizontal, diagonal,” says Christopoulou. “Everybody’s impacted.” * ", "tags": ["global", "development", "aid", "cuts", "greece", "women's", "rights", "and", "gender", "equality", "migration", "global", "health", "human", "rights", "(law)", "human", "rights", "(global", "development)", "features"]},

The plans have been called an attack on other nations’ sovereignty and one health organisation warned of “unimaginable effects” including a rise in deaths and violence, as safe clinics for vulnerable groups close. Under the Mexico City policy, also known as the “ ”, foreign health organisations that provide information, referrals or services for abortion are already denied US funds, but the policy will now be extended to those deemed to promote what is loosely termed “gender ideology” or any initiatives to promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Governments and major multilateral organisations such as UN agencies are likely to fall under the policy for the first time and will face “very hard choices” over whether to stick with policies and programmes that fight discrimination, at the risk of losing a major source of funding, global health experts said. The rule, otherwise known as the Mexico City policy, requires NGOs to certify that they will not perform or promote abortions anywhere in the world as a condition for receiving US family planning funds. Every Republican president since 1985 has implemented it. But in January 2017,   , under which NGOs that refuse to sign will be refused all health assistance, including for HIV, primary care, nutrition, tuberculosis and malaria programs. As much as $9bn in US funding was affected – money that developing world health budgets can ill afford to do without. While US officials have yet to set out what they mean by DEI initiatives, there is scope for it to include vast swathes of healthcare and support for people in crisis. Young women and teenage girls in Africa account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections, but programmes specifically supporting them could fall under the DEI umbrella. Vaccination programmes that rely specifically on training female workers, who can go into women’s homes to provide care where men could not, might collapse. Washington is negotiating new bilateral agreements with dozens of countries, and campaigners have urged governments to reject any US money that comes with those conditions. The global gag rule has been implemented under every Republican president since Reagan. It means any foreign organisations receiving US global health funding must certify that neither it, nor any other NGO with which it works, promotes or provides abortion, even with money from other donors. The   so that it also covers “gender ideology and diversity, equity and inclusion activities”. While not yet formally announced by the US state department,   the expanded rule would also apply to US-based NGOs, foreign governments, the UN and multilateral organisations for the first time, as well as all non-military foreign aid. Approached for confirmation, a senior state department official said: “The state department continues to advance President Trump’s American First foreign policy. “The department will soon take additional steps to close loopholes that allowed taxpayer funding for promotion of abortion in previous iterations of the Mexico City policy and expand the scope of the policy to ensure every penny of US foreign assistance prioritises American values, not the woke agenda,” the official said. Beth Schlachter, MSI’s senior director for US external relations, called the reports “deeply concerning”. She said: “Such a move, which goes far beyond previous restrictions, would be an insidious encroachment on sovereignty, pressuring governments to change their own laws and policies in exchange for US funding, despite repeated claims to respect national autonomy. “It risks causing real human suffering, undermining global health and destabilising decades of partnerships and progress,” she said. Shortly after taking office, Trump   to “terminate every diversity, equity and inclusion program across the entire federal government”. The administration has also attacked DEI policies in  , in  , and in multilateral organisations such as  . Rajat Khosla, director of the Partnership of Maternal, Newborn and Child  , said the interventions had already created a “chilling effect” and an expanded global gag rule would have “unimaginable effects”. The   published by the US state department in September set out plans to create more bilateral agreements with aid-recipient countries in place of working via NGOs. Khosla added: “For countries desperate for external aid, this would present some very hard choices.” Beirne Roose-Snyder, senior policy fellow of the Council for Global Equality, said equity initiatives played a big role in successful health programmes globally, which often required “special intentional effort” to target specific groups, such as LGBTQ+ people. She stressed that the restrictions were not “about what can be done with US funds” but sought to control what organisations and governments did outside US-funded work. Roose-Snyder said the new rules looked likely to apply even to humanitarian spending. “The administration wants to be able to do ‘ideological purity’ testing before helping after [a natural disaster, such as] a tsunami,” she said. She said key questions about the definition of “promotion of gender ideology” and DEI had yet to be answered, urging organisations to wait until they had formal notification before making any changes. Yumnah Hattas, gender justice lead at Frontline Aids, said the expanded plans were “in line with the rising transnational anti-rights movement” and would mean “human rights will be violated at a large scale”. She said the global gag rule historically had forced abortions to go underground and led to women dying. The extension had the potential to affect areas including “access to contraception, HIV prevention and gender-based violence services”, she said, predicting increases in pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections and HIV, and domestic violence. Hattas said: “We need to be going to governments and saying, ‘refuse US government  funding, find the funds within your own government.’” Such a stance was “complicated and difficult and painful”, she acknowledged, but added: “If you ignore the US government, then it doesn’t matter any more. Then the global impact of the global gag rule no longer exists because it was rejected by the globe.”", "tags": ["global", "development", "dei", "policies", "republicans", "aid", "abortion", "reproductive", "rights", "(global", "development)", "reproductive", "rights", "(society)", "news"]},

After losing their jobs abruptly when the   earlier this year, a group of dedicated workers decided to launch their own rescue package. Refusing to “wallow in misery”, Rob Rosenbaum, a former   economist, and a group of like-minded former agency staff began efforts to save some of the vital programmes that faced closure after the cuts. Now, almost 80 projects have been saved by a matchmaking service run by Rosenbaum and other former USAID staff, that has found them $110m (£82m) of new funding. The team behind the  (Pro) initiative estimates it will benefit 40 million people, including many children under five. After USAID closed,  , and projects worldwide either came to a shuddering halt or were left limping towards what Rosenbaum terms “drop-dead dates”. Rosenbaum and some of his colleagues were approached by a foundation that “wanted to figure out how they could make the best use of their limited resources”. They created a menu from the list of cancelled projects, identifying those “delivering the most life-saving aid per dollar” and where a new funder could feasibly step in and keep things going. They soon realised the demand was wider than that initial foundation and started to approach other potential donors. “We called ourselves the lifeboat crew at the beginning,” says Rosenbaum. “The ship has been sinking, and there aren’t enough lifeboats for every project to get on, and so we’re trying to literally save as many babies as we can, get as many on to these lifeboats as possible, via the projects that are delivering aid.” Pro, now working as part of the Center for Global Development thinktank, has secured funding for 79 projects on its list in more than 30 countries. Three have had USAID funding restored. Nine were not able to be saved in time. Funding has come from a mix of philanthropic foundations and wealthy individuals. Most wish to remain anonymous. “They come from very different reasons and perspectives, but the common thread that we’ve heard from them is, ‘I feel horrified by what’s going on. I really want to figure out a way to step in,’” says Rosenbaum. “I think that there was an ‘aha’ moment for all of us as we started working on this, that this created an opportunity to pivot from the ice-cream on the couch, wallowing in the misery of everything that was happening around us, to having something productive to really sink our teeth into.” One project that has found funding through Pro is work by the   (Alima) to provide services including treatment for severe acute malnutrition, maternity services and vital childhood vaccines in Mali. It is vital to keep such programmes going, says Rosenbaum, not only because restarting operations if they stopped would be hugely expensive but also because of how much trust would be lost in the conflict-ravaged areas if Alima withdrew. “Alima told us […] ‘we’re very worried that if we walk away, we may never be invited back.’” Projects with longer-term goals, such as strengthening health systems, or in other fields such as education, have not been part of Pro’s work. It also does not seek to save the projects indefinitely but to “buy time for the organisations and, frankly, the broader ecosystem, to figure out a longer-term solution”. Having found funding for all projects on its initial list, Pro says it will now focus on reaching more people with “proven, cost-effective interventions”.", "tags": ["usaid", "aid", "cuts", "donald", "trump", "children's", "health", "health", "features"]},

[Former Israeli prime minister] Golda Meir once said: “[W]e will perhaps in time be able to forgive the Arabs for killing our sons, but it will be harder for us to forgive them for having forced us to kill their sons.” That says it all. Sometimes, I think Israel should be studied by psychologists – maybe then the world would finally understand the madness we live under. I caught a ride to Deir al-Balah with a friend – it felt like an act of daring: cars altered to carry extra people, trailers clinging on like lifeboats. You hold on with everything you have, because if you don’t, you could fall into the open road and be lost. Near al-Nabulsi Square I saw a “ ” – a ribbon of fire across the sky. Fighter jets carved a line of explosions above Gaza City, one after another; ash clouds rose and everything below them was erased. I counted five, six rockets – then stopped counting because counting felt useless. I have to find shelter for my family – an apartment, a garage, any small place. My mind keeps slipping, I forget things, I forget plans – the chaos steals them. All I feel is a tight, small panic and the hollow hope that we will still be here the next day. Yesterday, I finally managed to get a garage – 1,500 shekels, about £335 a month. That’s the cheapest you can find, because demand is high while houses and buildings are bombed to the ground. This “garage” has almost no roof. The landlord even offered me a tiny apartment for 2,500 shekels – honestly, not even a flat in Dubai costs that much. In wars and crises people become more aggressive, more selfish, eager to profit from others’ misery. And maybe that’s “normal”, or rather the expected behaviour of someone who has lived through two years of forced displacement, expulsion, famine – especially inside the world’s largest prison. So I began setting up my new home – cleaning, arranging, trying to make it livable. I cannot allow myself even a second to think about my old room before the genocide, my box-spring bed, my gaming desk, the air conditioner, our house … I cannot let nostalgia take over. I just keep moving. Forward, forward – never looking back. For a week now I’ve been without my parents. Despite what my father said initially, they cling to hope – or to denial – believing that all the back-and-forth between the Qataris, Americans, Egyptians and Israelis means   City won’t be evacuated. So they refuse to leave. For two years the world has done as it pleases while we drown, and we clutch at the smallest, most obvious lies – the little straws that keep us breathing. The cruel truth is the Israelis were never coy about their aims: “We will destroy Gaza.” They did. “We will resettle you.” They did. “We will cut off food and water.” They did. “We will enter Rafah.” All eyes turned there. [US President Joe] Biden said no – they did it anyway. What comes next? Gaza City, my home. It will be emptied, become a wasteland like Rafah. I’m stealing a few quiet days now – a brief, fragile peace I’ve earned. My parents are finally with me. We turned the garage into a home – rooms, a little private space. Of course the walls are just plastic tarpaulins. I managed to get online for a moment. It has come to this: the IDF   for all of Gaza City, including the western part. People have no energy, no money, no will to leave their homes – many would rather die than go out. This afternoon our neighbour told us the  . OMG. They have no limits any more. Qatar – with the largest American military base in the Middle East – was reportedly hit by a power allied with the US. I think it’s clear what comes next and what it means for Gaza’s people: genocide until the last breath. They’ve been given carte blanche. My mother’s birthday – another quiet celebration under inhuman circumstances. Things have eased a little, but this is not the life we were meant to live. My phone showed me photos from her birthday in 2022: a homemade cake and my favourite New York cheesecake. I remember giving her Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell – we burned it for bread at the end of 2023 because we had no gas or wood to bake. What would Orwell think of us now? I like to imagine he’d forgive us. I wiped my tears in secret and kept going. Deir al-Balah is getting fuller and fuller. People are exhausted: they don’t want to die, but many feel they already have. I held my mother’s hand, kissed it, and whispered “Happy birthday”. She has been sick for days. I wrote her a letter and apologised because I don’t have a single cent for a cake (which would cost about $70) or even a small gift. Countries like the UK and Australia   – why now and to what end? Israel continues to bomb us, the genocide goes on. But now we can officially die as Palestinian people, we have a state. How nice. After all this suffering, so many countries that have denied for nearly two years that the systematic destruction of a population was taking place in Gaza are suddenly speaking up. Actors, singers and others join in because it’s become mainstream. Before, people would shrug and say, “Oh no, I don’t know enough about the Middle East, it’s too sensitive for me to comment.” Hypocrites. Same cruel routine, day after day – people die from hunger, from weakness, from the rockets that never stop. A man not far from us died recently. At first I thought it must have been the usual horror – a raid, a stray bullet. But no. He simply collapsed. His heart stopped. I still can’t believe how ordinary his death felt, how quickly a life can vanish and leave only a hollow silence. I was stunned, like I’d been anaesthetised to this kind of loss and suddenly woke up. My day is a map of survival: fetch water, scavenge for firewood, bake bread that barely fills a stomach. In the little time left, I search for scholarships – a small hope, it might be the only way out of this prison. But they ask for English tests; they know there are no test centres here. Online exams? Impossible: no stable internet, no valid passports to verify our identity. How can we prove who we are when the world has destroyed our papers and our connections? I am tired to my bones.", "tags": ["global", "development", "gaza", "israel", "israel-gaza", "war", "palestine", "features"]},

Speaking at   on Saturday, the Nigerian-American author of works including Americanah told an audience that having two sons has made her “worry more” about men and boys. “I keep reading these pieces about the manosphere, and I’ve just read a book about how men, how boys, are struggling, and now I’m terrified that my boys not only will struggle through their teen years, but then somehow will join the manosphere and start to talk about how women should be in the kitchen or something,” she said. “But really, that’s not going to happen. I will not respond well to that nonsense,” she added to audience laughter. Adichie and her husband, Ivara Esege, have three children: a 10-year-old daughter, and twin sons age one and a half. The boys are “going to grow up in a world that’s quite different from the world which I grew up in, and my husband grew up in”, she said. “I think they’re fortunate to have a good father.

Adichie appeared at the festival to collect the Sunday Times award for literary excellence, and was presented with a first edition copy of Chinua Achebe’s novel Arrow of God, which she described as his “greatest novel”. She then discussed her latest novel, Dream Count, with the Times literary critic Johanna Thomas-Corr. While Adichie spoke extensively about feminism, she did not address the backlash she has faced in recent years for her views on trans women.

Chinese authorities said about 350 people had made their way down but at least 200 remained stranded at the Everest Scenic Area, to the east of the mountain, on the Tibetan side of the border. Crowds of tourists had travelled to the region for “Golden Week”, an eight-day holiday period in China. But Chinese authorities, which control the Tibetan Autonomous Region, said heavy snowfall had hit the area on Friday and Saturday night,   at an elevation of more than 4,900 metres (16,000ft). “It was the most extreme weather I’ve ever faced in all my hiking experiences, without question,” Dong Shuchang, a Chinese trekker, said on Weibo, describing a “violent convective snowstorm on the eastern slope” of Everest. “I looked up in the middle of the night and saw that the snow had nearly covered the top,” said another trekker on Xiaohongshu. “It was the first time I truly felt the fear of being buried alive.” One Chinese trekker said their group had been “too scared to sleep” on Saturday as snow quickly piled up around their tents, forcing them to clear it every 90 minutes. They decided to descend on Sunday as the weather worsened. On the way, we met our guide’s father, who had come looking for him. That’s when we learned the snow was heavy in the valley, too; villagers, unable to contact their children on the mountain, were extremely worried.” The northern and eastern side of Everest is more accessible than sites on the   side of the border, and draws high numbers of visitors for less technical trekking, without summiting the peak. Photos and video posted online showed tents buried in snow, and lines of trekkers walking through waist-high drifts to get down the mountain. “The snow was very deep, and the trail extremely slippery. Trekkers stumbled frequently – some fell, others were bumped by yaks,” said one, who added that all safely descended and were picked up by bus. By Sunday afternoon, about 350 people had reached Qudang, a small town about 30 miles away from the Tibet-side base camp of Everest, “in good health”, state media reported. At least 200 more were still stranded, but had been contacted, the reports said. Jimu News reported that hundreds of rescuers had gone up the mountain to help people and clear snow from blocking the way out. There was little official reporting or updated information about the rescue effort on Monday. It was also not clear if the weather had affected anyone on the northern side of Everest, also in Tibet. The region is tightly controlled by the Chinese government, and journalistic access restricted. The weather also appears to have affected local communications, with calls to local businesses not connecting. Several trekkers said power was out in Qudang when they arrived. October is a peak season for the area, with usually clear and mild weather, but Chen Geshuang, one of 18 members of a trekking group that made it back to Qudang, said that the weather this year was “not normal”. “The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly.” The local tourism authority said ticket sales and entry to the Everest Scenic Area were suspended from Saturday. Neighbouring countries were also hit by extreme weather. Heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 47 people since Friday in Nepal.", "tags": ["mount", "everest", "tibet", "china", "nepal", "mountaineering", "asia", "pacific", "south", "and", "central", "asia", "news"]},

A spokesperson for Blair said the meeting was “long before his [Epstein’s] crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction”. A government spokesperson said Powell had only forwarded the request in his role as chief of staff. Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/10/palestinians-displaced-gaza-home-ceasefire-israel-hamas", "content": "Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza have begun to return to the ruins of their homes after the ceasefire rapidly negotiated in recent days between Hamas and   came into effect at noon local time on Friday – the first relief from relentless violence that inhabitants of the devastated territory have had since March. Israeli troops withdrew to new agreed-upon positions during Friday morning and   is expected to release the 20 living Israeli hostages it is holding early next week, after which Israel will free 250 Palestinians serving long-term sentences in Israeli prisons, as well as 1,700 others detained during the war. The hostages for prisoners deal, approved by the Israeli cabinet on Thursday night, is the   announced by Donald Trump last week that has raised hopes of a durable end to the two-year conflict, though all involved recognise the difficulties ahead. The Israeli prime minister,  , claimed credit for the hostage release, saying in an address on Friday that the “security of Israel” had dictated his actions in Gaza. “I believed that if we applied heavy military pressure, combined with heavy diplomatic pressure, we would absolutely be able to return all of our hostages,” said Netanyahu, who thanked Trump for his support. The US president is expected to visit Israel on Monday to address the Knesset in Jerusalem. Netanyahu also threatened a return to violence. “Hamas agreed to the deal only when it felt the sword resting on its neck and it is still on its neck … Hamas will be disarmed and   will be demilitarised … If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better. And if not, it will be achieved the hard way,” he said. Officials from Hamas appeared equally sceptical. Basel Naim, a senior leader of the militant group, said in an interview with Sky News on Friday that it would not disarm, contrary to the Trump plan. “Our weapons are going to be handed over only to the hands of a Palestinian state, and our fighters can be integrated into the Palestinian national army,” Naim said. In a joint statement issued later on Friday evening, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of   rejected any “foreign guardianship” over Gaza, stressing that its governance was a purely internal Palestinian matter. But they expressed their readiness to benefit from Arab and international participation in the reconstruction of the territory. Officials have said Israeli forces will remain in control of 53% of Gaza in the initial withdrawal phase before the hostages are released, and Israeli bombing in Gaza had intensified on Friday morning up until the ceasefire began. However, Israeli troops were seen pulling back from areas such as the eastern part of Khan Younis, southern Gaza, and the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza. With the announcement that a ceasefire had begun, thousands of Palestinians began heading north towards Gaza City, the territory’s biggest urban area, mostly on foot. Nearly half a million Palestinians living in north Gaza were displaced by Israel’s military advance into Gaza City, and many were eager to return to their homes. Footage showed huge crowds on the coastal road, which had been closed to returnees just days prior. “On the road, I saw someone returning. When he saw his house still standing from a distance, he began to run and shout with joy,” Asmaa Zuheir said. “At that moment, I felt pain because I was returning to my area knowing my house was already completely destroyed.” In the south of Gaza, thousands left the crowded coastal strip of al-Mawasi to travel inland to the partly ruined city of Khan Younis. Ahmed al-Brim pushed a bicycle loaded with wood through row after row of buildings crumpled by bombardment and streets strewn with rubble. “We went to our area – it was exterminated,” he said. “We don’t know where we will go after that.“ Another Khan Younis resident, Muhannad al-Shawaf, said it used to take him three minutes to reach a nearby street from his house. Now, it took over an hour as he picked his way through piles of debris. “The destruction is huge and indescribable – indescribable,” he said. “It is almost all in ruins and not suitable for living in.” The conflict has destroyed or damaged more than 90% of homes in Gaza and almost all infrastructure. Almost everyone in the territory has been displaced many times. Malnutrition is rife across all of Gaza, and there is famine in parts, according to UN-backed food experts. The ceasefire is meant to be accompanied by a surge in humanitarian and medical aid into Gaza through all five crossings from Israel, though it is unclear how and when this will happen. Israeli army radio said Israel would allow 600 aid trucks into Gaza each day. Aid agencies say such quantities are grossly insufficient. Leading international agencies, including the UN Palestinian refugee relief agency, Unrwa, said they had yet to receive details on what role they would be able to play during the ceasefire. Unrwa, which has been banned from operating in Israel, urged Israeli authorities to allow it to take 6,000 trucks’ worth of aid into Gaza, including enough food to feed the population for three months, from Jordan and Egypt. “We’ve not had any progress to move those supplies into Gaza … and this is absolutely critical in controlling the spread of famine,” Juliette Touma, the spokesperson for Unrwa, said. Care International said on Friday it still had not received clearance for its supplies to enter. “We still need clarity on how we’ll be able to get supplies into Gaza that have been stuck outside for months,” said Jolien Veldwijk, Care’s Palestine director. More than 67,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed during Israel’s offensive, and the toll is expected to rise. Medical workers announced that they would use the ceasefire period to start recovering bodies trapped under rubble. Thousands of bodies are though to lie under the debris of ruined buildings, as fighting made excavation and recovery difficult. Israel launched the war in response to a Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Though there is much relief in Israel and in Gaza at the ceasefire, there is anxiety too. Trump’s ambitious 20-point proposal calls for the disarmament of Hamas, further Israeli withdrawals, the creation of an international stabilisation force and a new technocratic Palestinian administration which would answer to Trump. Little of this has been discussed in detail during the frantic negotiations in recent days, and securing agreement from all parties on the thornier issues will be extremely difficult. Already disagreements have emerged over the makeup of the body that will take power from Hamas in Gaza. The US has said Trump and the former UK prime minister Tony Blair will lead the body, while Hamas has called for a Palestinian led-entity to oversee administration of the strip. Naim rejected the involvement of Blair in particular. Bringing the war in Gaza to a close would mark the biggest foreign policy achievement so far for Trump, who took office in January promising to quickly end the conflict there and in Ukraine, only to be confronted with obstacles and complexities he had apparently not foreseen.

On the first day of the party’s annual conference in Aberdeen, the vast majority of members backed the leadership’s motion that next May’s Holyrood elections should be fought on a “clear platform of national independence” and that winning a majority in the Scottish parliament – by securing 65 seats or more – would be “the only uncontested way to deliver a new vote on Scotland’s future”. After a passionate – and at times highly technical – debate, the conference rejected a rebel amendment put by more than 40 local branches that set out a more fundamentalist strategy of treating next year’s election as a de facto referendum, meaning that if the SNP and other pro-independence parties win a majority of the popular vote in 2026, it should be treated as a mandate to open independence negotiations directly. This de facto idea was first promoted by the former party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who acknowledged it as a “mistake” in her recent memoir. Echoing the confidence of   yesterday, Swinney told the packed conference hall that “we are within touching distance of the 65 seats that will make the world sit up and take notice” and urged the party to back taking a “clear, unambiguous message” to the public. Depute leader Keith Brown, who seconded the motion, told delegates: “The only way we can achieve independence is to ask a clear question and get a clear answer.” This call to clarity is key: while independence is not high on the list of voters’ priorities, activists have unhappy memories of trying to explain what many believed was a fatally muddled independence strategy on the doorstep for the general election last year, where the SNP was humiliated by the resurgent Labour party, losing 38 of its 48 Westminster seats. A year on, the party’s pivot to its core message is a mark of renewed confidence, with the SNP once again leading the polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK, and an understanding that the battleground demographic for the coming campaign is made up of those “soft yes” independence supporters who have drifted away from the party. Speaking for the de facto amendment, veteran activist Graeme McCormick insisted that it was not proposed by “romantic nationalists”. He warned that the SNP was being “hollowed out” because it had failed to inspire its membership with a date for another referendum. The former MP Tommy Sheppard said it was “remarkable” that such a large conference was able to have such a detailed discussion in public and in front of the media, but insisted there were “no quick fixes”. “We have been chasing the next election for too long,” he said, arguing that the party needed a strategy to take it into the 2030s and deepen support for independence.

Stalls sold keffiyehs and people handed out placards that read “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, “it’s not a crime to act against genocide” and “Starmer has blood on his hands, free Palestine”. Ben Jamal, the director of the campaign group, said the march went ahead, despite a ceasefire coming into effect, because the “plan that has been laid out by Donald Trump is not a plan for enduring peace”. He said the plan said “nothing about the root causes of violence” nor anything “about the system of apartheid” in Palestine or the “right to self-determination” for Palestinians. He added that the group’s campaigning and protesting would not end “until the Palestinian people are finally free”.

On Saturday, the Italian defence minister said the Rafah crossing, a crucial movement point between Gaza and Egypt for aid trucks but also people, will reopen on Tuesday. Israel took control of the border post last year. Rafah “will be opened alternately in two directions: exit towards Egypt and entry towards Gaza”, Guido Crosetto said. With the UN returning to a lead role in humanitarian assistance, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US- and Israeli-backed private contractor scheme, appeared to be winding down. The programme was widely condemned as it forced people towards food distribution sites where they   by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). One UN official called it a “sadistic death trap”.

Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Gaza early Saturday to observe the Israeli military redeployment, Israeli Army Radio reported, citing a security source. Still, there are concerns that the deal could break down unless pressure is kept up.

According to the agreement, Hamas is obliged to release all Israeli hostages from Gaza within 72 hours of the ceasefire starting, meaning Monday morning. Israel will free 250 Palestinians serving long sentences in its prisons and 1,700 other Palestinians captured during the war and held without charge. Israel’s prison service said on Saturday it had begun transferring prisoners from several detention facilities to two jails ahead of their release.

The   supreme court heard on Friday that earlier this month the star of The Deb, Charlotte MacInnes, was served a deposition in Los Angeles demanding she appear before a hearing in California later this month. MacInnes’s Sydney barrister, Sue Chrysanthou, told the court the deposition, which could force MacInnes to answer questions over whether she was pressured or offered inducements to withdraw her allegations of sexual harassment against one of The Deb’s producers, was a tactic by Wilson designed to “harass and intimidate” her lead actor over separate defamation action being taken by MacInnes against Wilson in the federal court. The Deb producers and their company AI Film are suing Wilson and her company Camp Sugar in the supreme court for allegedly breaking several contracts. At Friday’s hearing they sought interlocutory relief, requesting an urgent temporary injunction to stop Wilson pursuing a countersuit in California, where she is being sued for defamation by the producers. Justice James Hmelnitsky denied the request, on the grounds that an application for a final injunction would be heard before the US case progressed. Wilson was represented at Friday’s interlocutory hearing by Declan Roche SC. After the hearing Wilson’s legal team said in a statement she strenuously denied any wrongdoing and had “repeatedly emphasised that her concerns were to ensure a safe workplace during the filming of the The Deb and then to see the movie released”. The hearing came as the producers announced overnight that they had finally secured a distributor for The Deb after months of delays due to the escalating legal battle now raging on two continents, with each side accusing the other of deliberately sabotaging the film’s release. Chrysanthou told the court that if a temporary injunction was not given, the plaintiffs and witnesses would be forced into a costly battle defending themselves in California, where legal costs cannot be recovered. Wilson’s bid to have her cross-complaint heard in a no-cost jurisdiction was “plainly scandalous and vexatious”, Chrysanthou said, and the issues ought to be determined by courts in NSW, where the movie was filmed. Wilson served an amended cross-complaint on Wednesday on The Deb producers Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron and Vince Holden and their company AI Film in London, raising claims of financial misconduct, coercion and harassment against the producers. Chrysanthou said these issues were already being litigated in Australia and that Wilson previously agreed they should be resolved under NSW jurisdiction. Wilson is being sued in the supreme court by AI Film on the grounds her actions allegedly broke several contracts, including agreements relating to her role as a shareholder, director, producer and actor in The Deb. They also accuse her of misleading or deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law and of making harmful false statements on her Instagram account. Wilson’s legal team has submitted a defence denying the allegations that she sabotaged the release of The Deb, and asserting that she had raised legitimate concerns about the producers’ alleged misconduct and financial mismanagement. In the US defamation case, the producers allege Wilson’s decision to ignore MacInnes’s repeated denials of abuse showed Wilson acted with knowledge and malice, to promote a narrative that harmed both MacInnes and Ghost. Court documents also allege that Wilson orchestrated a smear campaign involving malicious websites targeting both women, portraying Ghost as an “Indian Ghislaine Maxwell” and MacInnes as complicit, with Wilson implying MacInnes denied being a victim in exchange for a lead role and a record deal. MacInnes has strongly denied these claims and on 22 September filed a defamation lawsuit in the federal court, arguing Wilson’s statements were false, malicious and damaging to her reputation and career. On Thursday AI Film announced that Rialto Distribution has acquired the rights for The Deb in Australia and New Zealand, with plans for a wide theatrical release in January.  This article was amended on 11 October 2025 to include the outcome of the hearing and an additional statement from Rebel Wilson’s legal team.

Rinyirru (Lakefield) Aboriginal Corporation chair, Alwyn Lyall, wrote to the environment minister, Andrew Powell, on Friday saying the removal of a crocodile longer than 4 metres, known as “Old Faithful”, from Rinyirru – or Lakefield national park – last month was based on a “flawed and outdated” test of his behaviour and highlighted “a bigger problem in how crocodiles are managed”. The letter called on the state government to dismantle all crocodile traps and cease removals from the park – described as “Queensland’s Kakadu” – until the problems highlighted in the case of Old Faithful were resolved. The crocodile, which Lyall wrote was about 4.5 metres long, has a distinctive white scar across his belly and jaw and was made famous by Steve Irwin in his 1990s series, when Old Faithful was “hazed” by “The Crocodile Hunter” in an effort to instil fear of humans into the big reptile. Almost 30 years later, the crocodile was captured once again and, this time, removed from Rinyirru  . He is being held in a government facility in Cairns, more than 250km south, awaiting transfer to a crocodile farm. After his removal, the Queensland environment department said they had been monitoring Old Faithful due to reports from the public and observed him “displaying concerning behaviour” in the prized barramundi fishing hole on the Normanby River that has been his territory for decades. So, the department said, the crocodile was “removed to ensure public safety”. Rangers also removed a smaller saltwater crocodile, between 3 metres and 3.5 metres long. The department said the decision to remove both crocodiles was made after consultation with traditional owners. But in his letter, Lyall wrote that “key information” was “withheld” from traditional owners by the department during that consultation in what he now believes was “the hope of gaining our approval and expediting the removal process for their own agenda”. “We have reason to believe that Old Faithful was not the crocodile targeted for removal and that the animal reported by the public as the ‘problem crocodile’ was the smaller, emaciated crocodile, also caught during the trapping process,” Lyall wrote in a statement. “Our board have engaged with many stakeholders and we strongly believe Old Faithful was caught as a wrongful arrest.” The Kuku Warra man wrote that the “simulated fishing test” where a crocodile is lured with bait was “designed to elicit the behaviour needed to warrant removal” and likened it to “constantly throwing bananas at a cassowary at Etty Bay until it feeds, or kicking a   until it bites”. “If you throw a barramundi out on a piece of rope and drag it back in and throw it out again and drag it back in and throw it out … You’re gonna get that crocodile’s attention sooner or later,” Lyall said. The Rinyirru Aboriginal Corporation chair said that big crocodiles like Old Faithful were a major tourist drawcard – but the attraction had proved a double-edged sword. While some were “just happy to see that crocodile on the bank”, others wanted the crocodile “right in front of them”. “If all of these people are feeding these crocodiles so they can take a photo of it, it makes that crocodile become lazy … it depends on hand outs,” he said. “Then our iconic crocodiles become the problem, because they are just sitting there waiting to be fed. Sign up to  Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “I find that to be very unfair – I think more onus should be coming back to the visitors that come into the park”. Lyall said he believed the department was “eyeing off” another three big crocodiles from Rinyirru as a result of the behaviour of visitors and the standard of tests used to determine if a crocodile was “a problem”. “For that reason, our board have asked the Queensland government to halt any further removals and to dismantle traps currently set in the park until a better plan is developed,” he wrote. Lyall wrote that the Rinyirru corporation’s board had engaged crocodile scientists emeritus professor Gordon Grigg and Dr Ross Dwyer and were advised that a captured crocodile could be returned to the wild and that there was precedent for it being done. “Old Faithful could be 80 or 100 years old – he deserves to live out his life in peace,” Lyall wrote. “We are asking that Old Faithful be returned home. He doesn’t belong to the Queensland government. He belongs to Rinyirru, and Rinyirru belongs to him.” The Environmental Defenders Office, acting on behalf of advocacy group Community Representation of   (Croc), has requested and is awaiting a statement of reasons from the department to explain Old Faithful’s removal. A department spokesperson responded to questions with a statement saying “public safety is our top priority” and that the department “extensively monitored the crocodile after reports from the public raising safety concerns”. “We understand people were using food to lure the animal from the water to take photos,” the spokesperson said. “Habituating crocodiles is detrimental to the animal and dangerous for people. “The crocodile was displaying repeated and concerning behaviour that was escalating. It was ultimately removed to keep people safe.”", "tags": ["queensland", "crocodiles", "wildlife", "reptiles", "news"]},

Video captured by the Australian   Conservancy (AWC) shows some of the juveniles exploring outside their den at Mallee Cliffs national park. Five numbat joeys, including quadruplet siblings, were seen at Mallee Cliffs and two more at Scotia wildlife sanctuary. The wildlife conservancy works with state national parks staff at both sites on projects that have been reintroducing the species in predator-free areas. Brad Leue, the videographer and photographer who captured the footage at Mallee Cliffs, said he watched the animals exploring outside the family den, which has an opening about the size of a coffee cup. “I was lucky enough to observe them for a couple of days and get an idea of their routine, which involved sharing a den with mum overnight, venturing out around 8am, and playing within 50 metres of their home while mum hunts for termites,” Leue said. Rachel Ladd, a wildlife ecologist with AWC, said babies were always a special find, “particularly for a species as difficult to spot in the wild as the numbat”. “Seeing seven young numbats lets us know that the population is breeding in favourable environmental conditions and becoming more established.” Numbats are one of Australia’s rarest marsupials and are listed as endangered under national laws. Unlike other Australian marsupials, they are active during the day and feed exclusively on termites.

The bravest of the lot even ran up to me to check me out before scurrying back – it wasn’t scared at all.” The other two babies were observed running around logs at Scotia wildlife sanctuary on Barkindji Country, where the species was reintroduced in the late 1990s.

Ties between the US and Brazil have nosedived as a result of Trump’s campaign to  In August, the US introduced 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, partly as a result of what Trump called the “witch-hunt” against Brazil’s former president, who was accused of trying to seize power after losing the 2022 election to Lula. US efforts to derail Bolsonaro’s prosecution – which also included sanctioning Brazilian officials and revoking visas – failed. On 11 September, Bolsonaro was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison by the supreme court. A fortnight later, Trump appeared to extend an olive branch to Lula at the UN general assembly in New York. “He seemed like a very nice man, actually,” Trump said of his leftwing counterpart after a brief backstage encounter during which the US president claimed there had been “excellent chemistry”. On Monday, Trump and Lula held their first extended conversation since the former returned to the White House in January. “It was positive,” Brazil’s finance minister, Fernando Haddad, who also took part in the half-hour call, told reporters after. In a statement, Brazil’s presidency said Trump and Lula had “recalled the good chemistry felt in New York” and “exchanged phone numbers to establish a direct channel of communication”. Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump celebrated “a very good” exchange, adding: “I enjoyed the call – Our Countries will do very well together!” Lula called the conversation “an opportunity to restore the friendly 201-year relationship between the west’s two biggest democracies” and asked for US tariffs and sanctions against Brazilian officials to be scrapped. Lula also said he hoped to meet Trump in person, possibly at a summit in Malaysia later this month, or by travelling to the US. He reiterated his invitation for the US president to attend November’s Cop30 climate summit in the Amazon city of Belém. Trump said: “We discussed many things, but it was mostly focused on the Economy, and Trade, between our two Countries. We will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future, both in Brazil and the United States.” Matias Spektor, an international relations professor at Brazil’s Getúlio Vargas Foundation, said it was too early to declare the rift between Brasília and Washington over: “All we know is that Trump is willing to talk and that Lula is willing to talk as well.” It was unclear whether Trump raised Bolsonaro’s plight during the call – but even if he did, Spektor said there was nothing Lula could offer the US president with regards to that. “Lula simply cannot deliver any changes in the way the supreme court treats Bolsonaro … even if he wanted to.” However, Spektor believed one possible area where Brazil could help Trump was  . Last week the UN security council approved US-backed plans for a thousands-strong “Gang Suppression Force” to tackle the crisis in the Caribbean country. In 2004, during Lula’s first presidential term, Brazil began sending thousands of troops to Haiti to lead the UN stabilisation mission there, which lasted until 2017. Just over two decades later, Spektor wondered whether Brazilian boots might again be seen on the ground in Port-au-Prince. “I may well be very wrong … It could be the case that nobody in the [Lula] administration wants to burn their fingers with this,” Spektor said. “[But] Haiti is one instance in which the demand coming from the White House could be met by Brazil – and it’s something Brazil has done in the past and … that Lula could present as Brazil’s contribution to world order, stability and peace at a time at which things are so messy. “And if this is an area where Lula can do something that Trump will appreciate, this is where you have a bridge between Trump and Lula … The stars could align.”", "tags": ["brazil", "trump", "tariffs", "haiti", "donald", "trump", "americas", "luiz", "inácio", "lula", "da", "silva", "us", "foreign", "policy", "news"]},

Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, both 72, will tour the US,   and Mexico, playing seven concerts in summer 2026 beginning in Los Angeles on 7 June. Lee said in a statement: “It’s been over 10 years since Alex and I have performed the music of Rush alongside our fallen bandmate and friend Neil. A lifetime’s worth of songs that we had put our cumulative hearts and souls into writing, recording and playing together onstage. And so, after all that has gone down since that last show, Alex and I have done some serious soul searching and come to the decision that we fucking miss it, and that it’s time for a celebration of 50-something years of Rush music.” Lee promises a “vast selection of songs” from the band’s 19 studio albums, and while crediting Peart as “irreplaceable”, announced a “remarkable” new drummer, Anika Nilles. Lee previously praised her in a  , saying: “I heard this drummer the other day, I think her name is Anika [Nilles].

The rehearse evacuation, ordered by President   as part of a nationwide “civil protection and preparation of the people” exercise, came as Donald Trump turned the heat up on Venezuela’s leader to levels rarely seen before. Since early August, when Trump signed a secret directive authorizing military action against Latin American drug cartels, the US president has labelled Maduro a “narco-terrorist” fugitive and advertised  ; deployed marines and warships off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast; and ordered at least four   on alleged drug smuggling boats, which have killed at least 21. Last week Trump again upped the ante, declaring a “non-international armed conflict” against drug cartels  Washington has justified its strikes as part of a crackdown on Venezuelan narco-traffickers whom the US accuses of flooding its streets with drugs, supposedly at Maduro’s behest. “They’re the enemies of all humanity,” Trump told the UN last month, vowing to blow such “terrorist thugs … out of existence”. But many observers suspect Trump’s counter-narcotics crusade is really a pretext to depose Maduro, either by sparking an internal rebellion against Hugo Chávez’s authoritarian heir or perhaps through direct military intervention within Venezuela itself. Speaking to the New York Times last month, Venezuela’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, said she was convinced one of Trump’s “strategic objectives” was “what they call ‘regime change’”. “We will never hand over our homeland!” Rodríguez   as she announced that Maduro would declare a state of emergency in the event of a US attack. Rodríguez and Meléndez are not the only Maduro allies talking tough in the face of US pressure. One recent evening, the interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, appeared on television clutching a heavily annotated copy of a book about the “military thinking” of the Vietnamese revolutionary Ho Chi Minh. The message was clear: any attempt to topple Maduro’s regime would suck US troops into a bloody quagmire such as the one that unfolded in south-east Asia in the 60s and 70s, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians and nearly 60,000 American soldiers. Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for Crisis Group, doubted Trump had immediate plans to target Fort Tiuna, the military base where Maduro is thought to live. But Gunson did think Trump’s bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities in June had left Venezuela’s leaders genuinely alarmed. In a recent letter to Trump, Maduro tried to defuse the situation, writing: “I respectfully invite you, President, to promote peace through constructive dialogue and mutual understanding throughout the hemisphere.” “What Trump did to Iran was a wake-up call to the people in government here,” said Gunson. “A lot of analysts thought that wasn’t going to happen … But they did it – and the Iranians had no response. And I think that that was quite sobering for the Chavistas. The idea of a US intervention is music to the ears of some of Maduro’s political foes, who are desperate to end his 12-year rule during which Venezuela’s economy and democracy have crumbled and millions have fled abroad. In a recent interview, the prominent conservative politician María Corina Machado – whose ally, Edmundo González, is widely believed to have beaten Maduro in last year’s election – hailed Trump’s “visionary” stance. “I totally support his strategy … I’m in favour of the US dismantling this criminal structure,” Machado, who is in hiding in Venezuela, told the Sunday Times. The exiled opposition leader Leopoldo López has said their movement supports “any scenario that helps us transition to democracy”. Robert Evan Ellis, a Latin America specialist who advised the state department on Venezuela policy during Trump’s first administration, saw a “50-50” chance of the opposition’s wish coming true. Trump’s failure to unseat Maduro with a “maximum pressure” campaign during his first term, made it more likely the US president would try to finish the job now, Evan Ellis said. “I think there’s … a certain determination not to essentially feel that he loses this time around as well – so I think that creates incentive,” he said. After the Caribbean boat strikes, Evan Ellis anticipated a “graduated escalation” of US pressure – perhaps airstrikes against “narco-planes” or “narco-leaders” on Venezuelan soil: “You don’t just unnecessarily jump from blowing up a couple of ships to pulling the trigger on a major air-land campaign.” But Evan Ellis did not rule out a large-scale “multi-pronged attack”, ​that could see ship-launched missiles destroy Venezuela’s aerial defences​ and F-35 fighter jets​ take to its skies before troops “grab[bed] Maduro wherever he is, based on probably good insider intelligence and took him to the US. On Thursday, Venezuela’s defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said five US “combat aircraft” had been detected flying off his country’s coast. Four days later, on Monday, another key Maduro ally, the national assembly president, Jorge Rodríguez, announced that he had informed US and European authorities of plans for an alleged “false flag operation” attack on the US embassy in Caracas. Rodríguez claimed rightwing extremists had been plotting to target the building with “lethal explosives”. The prospect of a US intervention fills many Venezuelans – even those opposed to Maduro – with dread. “If there’s a war, what will we do?” said Naide González, 58, a cleaner from 23 de Enero, a working-class community in Caracas long considered a stronghold of Chavismo. In  , Juan González, the White House’s top Latin America official under Joe Biden, called Trump’s military buildup “political theatre” designed to convince Maga voters that he was taking a hard line on drugs and migrants coming from South America. But González feared that if Maduro was deposed, the US could stumble into a protracted guerrilla war, involving a variety of armed groups including government-linked paramilitaries, criminal organizations and  . “The conditions are ripe here for some kind of protracted low-intensity conflict, if the US gets it wrong – which they may well,” Gunson warned.  This country is absolutely packed from end to end with armed groups of various kinds, none of whom has any incentive to just surrender or stop doing what they’re doing.” David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela specialist, said neoconservative Trump officials and hardline members of Venezuela’s opposition seemed convinced by the “absolutely absurd” idea that Maduro was “hanging on by threads” and that regime change could be achieved “with just a few limited strikes”. “This is the mentality that thought that Iraq under Saddam Hussein was a house of cards and Iraq would be a cakewalk once you got rid of Saddam Hussein or took Baghdad,” Smilde added. At La Rinconada, government supporters vowed to resist any foreign intervention as commuters streamed out of the underground into a sunny Caracas morning. Amelia Contreras, a 68-year-old seamstress who is part of Maduro’s Bolivarian militia volunteer group, said she had been receiving first aid and firearms training in preparation for a possible attack. In the event of an incursion, Contreras had been tasked with defending Caracas’s electricity pylons. “We don’t want anyone coming along and interfering here – we won’t allow it,” she said. Kristian Laborín, a 48-year-old member of Maduro’s socialist party, had spent the last three Saturdays undergoing military training but still hoped the US would recoil. “President Trump, there’s still time for us to continue building friendly ties between our peoples,” Laborín said. But if the US president insisted on attacking, Laborín’s comrades would have no choice but to fight back.

The incident in 2016 led Marie Anière Martínez, a conservationist with the Patagonian environmental organisation Boana, and Lorena Martínez, a   official, to form a group to investigate water contamination at the Unesco world heritage site. Last year, they secured a   against water pollution in the Argentinian national park. Supported by , a regional treaty on environmental rights, residents filed a collective lawsuit, forcing authorities to acknowledge failures in waste management and commit to upgrading systems by January 2025. Yet despite this victory, the pollution persists and activists are still calling for more robust enforcement. “What have the authorities done to prevent environmental damage?” asks Marie Anière Martínez. Nestled in a 135-hectare (330-acre) valley in the shadow of Mount Fitz Roy, El Chaltén is home to up to 2,900 people during high season in the area, which is a paradise for hikers exploring Patagonia’s spectacular trails. Los Glaciares protects part of the southern Patagonian ice field – a massive freshwater reservoir in South America. Spanning 600,000 hectares of lakes, forests and glacier-fed rivers, the national park includes the Las Vueltas River sub-basin, where   running through El Chaltén. But environmental problems escalate during the peak tourist season, from November to April, when the village hosts up to 10,000 people a day, putting pressure on sanitation infrastructure. Complaints were first filed in 2022 by the community in El Chaltén, concerned about the sewage system’s collapse and the lack of clean energy. “In 2019, the Los Glaciares national park guidelines plan was developed with input from residents and experts,” says Lorena Martínez. “We had already warned about the lack of data and water monitoring.” In 2023, 21 residents sought an injunction to defend their constitutional right to a healthy environment. “We gathered previous studies, which already indicated that sewage effluent from the treatment plant of the public utility were reaching the Vueltas and Fitz Roy rivers without proper treatment,” she says. Local residents together with Martínez’s group, called  , proved that untreated sewage and resistant bacteria from overflowing treatment plants were contaminating waterways, threatening public health, according to judges. But still residents are waiting for action. Like many in the village, Paula Chaparro, a mountain guide, has been involved in monitoring the water and public advocacy over pollution for more than a decade. “We don’t know how, over time, sewage discharges into the river can impact ecosystems,” she says. “The pollution goes beyond the village and affects the entire course of the Las Vueltas River to Lake Viedma.” The activists are now supporting new legal action against the   for roadworks and other projects carried out in protected areas without environmental assessments. During the legal process, Karina Soledad Esquius and fellow biologists from the National University of Mar del Plata sampled water from 82 watercourses in the north of Los Glaciares park. In November 2023, they found multiresistant bacteria in the water. “In most of the environments sampled, the water quality is very good, but we found multiresistant   [E coli] near the confluence of the Vueltas and Fitz Roy rivers, close to the sewage treatment plant,” says María Soledad Domínguez, the biologist responsible for the analysis. “Of 27 isolates, five showed resistance to three different families of commonly used antibiotics.” Sign up to  Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion The results shocked Carolina Codó, a doctor at the community health centre, and pushed her to join the lawsuit. “Upon learning about the bacteria in the water, we took on a greater commitment to monitoring and demanding answers from the company and the authorities,” she says. The findings revealed serious failures in sewage management. A court in Comodoro Rivadavia found that, according to a 2019 audit, the state utilities company was operating the treatment plant without monitoring liquid waste or assessing environmental or public health effects. The company acknowledged that the two treatment plants could not handle the number of visitors during high season. “The system collapses when the population jumps from under 3,000 to more than 14,000,” says Melina Lorenti, the residents’ lawyer. “The public utilities state company committed to having the modules fully operational by mid-January 2025 and launched a public tender – now under evaluation – to expand the plant.” The company says it has two treatment plants with a third under construction, and is increasing capacity. On 1 July last year, it invited bids for a grease and oil separation system to be added to the El Chaltén plant. According to Adrián Alonso Durán, municipal director of environmental policy, the study on pollution in Las Vueltas River is inconclusive and needs more data. But he acknowledges the treatment plant’s limitations. “It has a fairly small capacity and does not operate at full capacity during the high season,” he says. He highlights less visible sources of pollution related to overtourism. “In restaurants, oil is often poured down the sink, which builds up and eventually clogs the pipes,” he says. “A municipal ordinance now requires the installation of grease traps in restaurants and hotels, which are mandatory for renewing commercial permits.” The utilities company says it has worked with the municipality to better regulate wastewater discharges, especially from laundries, restaurants and hotels. The national parks administration, a federal agency under the authority of the  , did not respond to a request for an interview. With campaigners saying their concerns have not been fully addressed, the Guardians of the El Chaltén Basin have set up a committee to ensure public oversight and access to technical information, a sustainable governance initiative supported by the OECD and  . “The big mistake is that El Chaltén expanded rapidly without an environmental framework in place,” says Lorenti. The conservationists in this Patagonian valley remain vigilant. “We must continue raising awareness about the water,” says Marie Anière Martínez. “This national park is a natural heritage site for all humanity.”", "tags": ["global", "development", "southern", "frontlines:", "latin", "america", "and", "the", "caribbean", "access", "to", "water", "glaciers", "argentina", "americas", "pollution", "water", "features"]},

But on Monday night the scruffy-haired South American populist – the former frontman in a Rolling Stones tribute band – took to the stage in Buenos Aires hoping to sing his way out of the funk. “Olé, olé, olé, olé! Milei! Milei!” thousands of diehard supporters chanted as the 54-year-old libertarian kicked off a concert at the city’s Movistar Arena – a 15,000-seat venue which has previously hosted rockers including Liam Gallagher, Judas Priest and Megadeth. Milei basked in the adulation, throwing his leather-clad arms into the air, and took a sip of water before proceeding with his nine-track set of mostly 1980s rock anthems. “I’m human,” he told the packed stadium. “It might not seem like it, but I am.” Milei   almost two years ago, vowing to save his country’s notoriously haywire economy by “exterminating” inflation and taking a metaphorical chainsaw to state spending. “Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of a tragic era for the world, these elections represent a tipping point in our history,” the Mick Jagger-impersonating crooner-turned-politician   as he took office in December 2023. For a while Milei’s ferocious austerity campaign appeared to be working –   – with the president’s success in taming triple-digit inflation drawing international plaudits.  celebrated Milei’s quest to “Make Argentina Great Again”. The Tory party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said she hoped to become a British version of Argentina’s president. The conservative historian Niall Ferguson flew to Buenos Aires to interview Argentina’s president and celebrate the “stunning recovery” his “shock therapy” had produced. “With his shaggy sideburns and loopy facial expressions, there is more than a hint of the Mad Hatter about him,”   in July. “[But] Milei is delivering a man-made miracle that should gladden the heart of every classical economist and quicken the pulse of all political libertarians.” In recent weeks, however, the wheels appear to have come off Milei’s revolution. Doubts over his political future have spooked markets and triggered a sharp sell-off of Argentina’s currency, the peso, with the government depleting its scarce international reserves in order to contain that run. In August,   by protesters amid growing public anger over a corruption scandal involving one of the most powerful people in his administration: his sister and chief of staff, Karina Milei. In September, Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party   – where nearly 40% of Argentina’s population lives – and there are fears among   that their candidates could receive a similar drubbing in nationwide midterms at the end of this month. On Sunday, a close Milei ally, José Luis Espert, was forced to pull out of that election after he was forced to admit that he had received a $200,000 payment from an alleged drug trafficker. “[Milei] is in a deep crisis: of governance, of the presidency itself, of popular support, of his ability to connect with young people,” said Sebastián Lacunza, the journalist who broke that scandal. Lacunza said he believed support was rapidly draining away from Milei as a result of questions over his ethics, as well as the human consequences of  . “The ‘chainsaw’ cuts have hit sensitive areas: pensioners’ incomes, top public paediatric hospitals, universities and households facing soaring costs for utilities and food.” The crisis is so severe that last month Trump stepped in with an emergency bailout of up to $20bn, with the US president declaring: “We’re backing him 100% – we think he’s doing a fantastic job.” Even Milei loyalists who flocked to Monday’s show admitted Argentina was in dire straits. “The country is a shambles. We’re not going to say it’s great – it’s a shambles,” said Oscar Luis Osorio, a 54-year-old shopkeeper who came dressed as a lion. “But we have to wait,” Osorio added, pointing out that Milei was less than halfway through his four-year term. Emanuel Lacuadra, a 27-year-old gig worker and student, shrugged off the Espert scandal. “I support the government almost unconditionally. There are many in the opposition who will try everything to bring it down, but for my part, I’ll always support it,” Lacuadra said, calling Milei’s presidency “a historic, unique moment – not only for Argentina but for the world”. Analysts paint a far less rosy picture of Milei’s predicament as he nears the start of his third year in power. “I would describe him as a president in economic, political and social default,” said Paola Zuban, a political scientist and co-director of the polling firm Zuban Córdoba. Zuban recalled how Milei won power in 2023 promising not only an economic revolution, but a moral one too, with his pledges to combat deceitful elites he called “ ” (the caste). That message had been severely undermined by the recent scandals involving his close allies. “With these corruption scandals, that moral bond has been broken. Expectations have fallen, trust has eroded, and that’s what has triggered this major crisis the government is facing today – one I believe it has little chance of recovering from,” Zuban said. Facundo Nejamkis, the director of the consulting firm Opina Argentina, described “a growing dissonance between how the government presents itself and the reality people live”. “The government talked about a ‘miracle’ that no Argentine can see in their daily life,” he added. Nejamkis saw Monday’s concert as an attempt to revive Milei’s faltering movement. But outside the area, even fervent Milei supporters wondered whether it was a wise move, given the headwinds buffeting their cause. “It seems ill-timed, at the very least,” said one prominent pro-Milei activist, who asked not to be named.

Noboa was inaugurating a water treatment plant in central   on Tuesday when his motorcade was set upon by a large group protesting against rising fuel prices. “About 500 people showed up and were throwing stones at him, and there are obviously bullet marks on the president’s car as well,” said Inés Manzano, the country’s environment minister. She said five people were arrested and would stand trial on terrorism charges – an offense carrying a maximum punishment of 30 years in jail. The defense minister, Gian Carlo Loffredo, told Teleamazonas TV channel that the incident was “a clear assassination attempt and an act of terrorism”. Video released by the government, reportedly filmed from inside the motorcade, shows protesters standing in the road, draped in flags, scrambling to collect large stones and bricks. As the presidential SUV passed, projectiles thudded into the panelling and shattered windows. A voice can be heard shouting: “Heads down! Heads down!” as the vehicle sped away. Officials said they were still investigating whether some of the impact marks on Noboa’s armored Chevrolet Suburban were caused by gunfire. The alleged attack came amid days of increasingly violent demonstrations sparked by a government decision to raise diesel prices. Protesters have gone on strike, blocked roads and abducted 16 soldiers – who were eventually released unharmed. ’s largest Indigenous organization reported on Sunday that a protester had been killed by armed forces during one of the rallies. More than 100 people, including protesters and security services, are believed to have been injured in the unrest. Noboa has declared a state of emergency across several provinces. Noboa’s office said on social media following the attack that “cowardly acts will not deter” the president. Albert Ramdin, head of the Organization of American States, said on the social media platform X that “such violent acts are an assault on democracy, stability, and the spirit of peaceful coexistence that must prevail in our societies.” The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador said the president’s convoy had “entered a resistance zone”, leading to “incidents that the government now uses to justify its war policy”. Lawyer Yaku Pérez told reporters that those arrested were not “at the protest. They were just confused” amid the commotion during which police fired teargas.

The elaborate modus operandi led the   that the attacks had been carried out by members of the Brazilian army’s elite unit, known as the “black cap boys”, trained in sabotage operations such as attacks on infrastructure facilities. Two years and eight months on, the perpetrators have still not been identified. Bolsonaro was last month  , along with seven of his closest allies, including five senior military officers. In a country that has seen more than a dozen coup attempts since it became a republic, the trial marked the first time in Brazil’s history that the ringleaders of such a plot were tried and convicted. The verdict prompted an outburst of   among defenders of democracy, but there is a growing sense among researchers – and even some former officers – that the armed forces have not been held accountable as institutions – and that the same mentality and training that drew the military into previous conspiracies remain unchanged. “The risk of a new coup remains very much alive,” said Rubens Pierrotti Jr, a retired colonel who served 32 years in the army and is now a lawyer and  . Twenty-five alleged conspirators – including 18 military personnel, five of them black cap boys – still face trial in the supreme court in the coming months.

Police were only authorised to carry out arrests the following morning, giving many the chance to flee. The riot’s financiers – alleged to have paid for rioters’ travel to Brasília and their food while they camped outside army barracks – also remain unidentified. Lucas Pedretti, who specialises in the study of Brazil’s  , said there had been a concerted effort by the armed forces to pin the blame on individuals, and absolve the military as an institution. “Bolsonaro, a former army captain, and the other military officers convicted so far are not outliers … They are the prodigal sons of an institution that produces individuals shaped by an authoritarian and violent mindset,” he said. Investigators believe the   the heads of the army and the air force refused to join, leaving the navy chief as Bolsonaro’s sole ally within the armed forces. Yet the two commanders did not report the coup plan to other authorities. Pierrotti said the “serpent’s egg” lay in the military academies: “That is where coup-plotters are being bred”. In the military academies, soldiers and officers are taught that the 1964 overthrow of a democratically elected president was not a coup but a “revolution” aimed at saving the country from communism. “There is indoctrination in the military schools … which ends up producing people with a far-right mindset and a mission to fight the ghost of communism,” Pierotti said. The historian Francisco Carlos Teixeira, one of Brazil’s most renowned scholars of civil-military relations, taught for years at the army’s main officers’ college, where he said the mentality had remained unchanged for decades: “They still believe that the military should have the final say on what is suitable for the Republic,” he said. Thiago André, who served as a navy sergeant for 14 years, said that from the moment he joined up he was told that “a coup to put Brazil back under military control would be better for the country, because the military is better than civilians at everything – including running society. “This coup mentality, and the idea that a coup is the best solution for putting Brazil back on track, is very popular inside, and I don’t think it will end with the convictions [of Bolsonaro and his allies],” said André, who left the force in 2022 to  . Neither the defence ministry, the army, the navy nor the air force responded to a request for comment. Teixeira said that unless there was structural reform of training and the very makeup of the forces – for example, the complete   – any government would remain “hostage” to the military. “Another coup attempt could happen again, in a more sophisticated and more brutal way, because the coup mentality remains untouched,” he said. “So, this celebration – this idea of rejoicing that the coup risk has ended because of one trial – is unrealistic because the structures that generate coups remain intact.”", "tags": ["brazil", "jair", "bolsonaro", "luiz", "inácio", "lula", "da", "silva", "americas", "features"]},

But when she and a graduate student peered through a microscope, they watched in astonishment as a brown wormlike creature greedily munching through green clumps of algae as if more than 130 years hadn’t passed since its last meal. Equally oblivious, a host of life – water fleas, worms, plankton – danced and spun around it. “We’ve been able to resurrect some of the ancient life that shows what this wetland was like prior to urbanization,” said Riskin, an soil expert at the University of Toronto who was called in to analyze the samples. “It’s hard not to get really excited about this.” Riskin’s work and separate research from a paleoecologist, have contributed towards two peer-reviewed studies due to be published soon on the team’s findings. For the researchers, the discoveries do more than just serve as a novel time capsule. Toronto’s multibillion-dollar effort to re-naturalize a major river and the surrounding lands, was advertised as one of the “largest waterfront revitalization projects” in the world. As the project nears completion, the discoveries have underscored the resilience of ecosystems in the face of human-led destruction. The samples that came to Riskin had themselves been the source of disbelief three years before, when heavy machinery was excavating vast amounts of dirt and debris from Toronto’s waterfront in an effort to re-route the Don River. When one of the bulldozers was halted by thick green shoots, the machine operator soon realized that the sedges and cattails looked nothing like the other weeds at the site. Scientists soon knew they were witnessing something both unexpected and profound: seeds and plant scraps, trapped underground for more than a century, had roared back to life. The peat bogs and wetlands had been buried under nearly 25ft of dirt and gravel more than a century ago, in an attempt to pacify the remaining scraps of wild around what is now one of North America’s largest cities. Decades later, in the 1920s,  , when they built a concrete canal, wresting control from the body of water as they realized a vision of a heavily industrialized district known as the Port Lands. But while the river’s flow was largely predictable, the over-engineering of the river meant storms would lead to costly flooding events. In response, a project first envisioned in 2007 to restore the area is nearing completion. Three hectares of new coastal wetland and four hectares of wildlife habitat have been added to a space that was once a post-industrial wasteland – a rare victory in an era of environmental degradation. The construction of a marshier, more natural meander to the river has also led to creation of a new island,  , where the discovery of century-old plants unfolded. “When the project started, it was like being on the moon. The space was so just barren, so awful, dusty. It was bereft of any life,” said Melanie Sifton, a horticultural expert who was on site at the time the cattails and sedges were spotted. She helped with the careful extraction of 50 pancake-shaped samples of soil bound for the University of Toronto’s labs. “To find what we did – it was like finding buried treasure.” Once in the lab, the team eagerly scoured the clods of dirt, and the excitement deepened. “What is still alive, and what’s revivable and what we can learn from all of this is far deeper than what was initially thought,” said Sifton. The century-old plants bursting from newly exposed soil initially made headlines, but it was only the first of a string of extraordinary discoveries. Pollen from the  , a tree now extinct in the area, was discovered in the dirt. So too was a seed from the 1500s. The remains of one of the largest and most important peat bogs in the region were rescued. Then, last year, the team submerged soil samples and made the astounding discovery of water fleas, trapped in the soil since at least the late 1800s, which had sprung back to life. So too had worms, larvae and zooplankton. “In general, humans have actually been very bad at recreating wetlands. It’s a really common mitigation tool for environmental damage [but] the problem is, [relocated] wetlands have very rarely functioned in the way that we hope they will.” Riskin says the complex feedback loops that underpin the ecosystems have long baffled experts. But in the recovery of plants and water fleas, the power, mystery – and even the the magic, of dirt has astounded veterans of ecosystem study. “The soil was ready to turn on. And that’s what I love so much about it. The microbes, the nutrients, all of those pieces that are so small and outside of the human scope of vision, that we don’t totally understand as well, were ready to make the soil into a thriving ecosystem.” said Riskin. The discoveries might also hint at the power of using native soils in restoration efforts to “enhance” ecosystems, says Riskin. Riskin and the University of Toronto paleoecologist Sarah Finkelstein plan to publish their study into the carbon dating of the seeds, the pollen assemblage discovered in the soil and the results of germination experiments. For Shelley Charles, an Anishinaabe elder who helped name the newly formed island Ookwemin Minising – an Anishnaabe name meaning “Place of the black cherry trees” – the findings vindicate a more holistic Indigenous world view of ecosystems. “We knew instinctively that seeds were there and but we didn’t realize the immensity of it all,” she said. “Traditional knowledge really has a story of today and the future, but it also connects us to the past. So when the first plants started reviving themselves, we realized something much bigger and more interconnected was unfolding.” To the surprise for those toiling on the grounds and waters, the replanting of native plant species has been followed by the return of beavers, muskrats, fish, turtles, snowy owls and eagles – species which Charles calls the “natural engineers of the ecosystem”. “There was a real feeling of validation that Indigenous knowledge could contribute in a very meaningful way to revitalization efforts. And this spread to most people that have been working on the project – those doing the planting or the engineering hydrology,” said Charles. For more than a century, the lands that would become Ookwemin Minising were a barren industrial zone. Today, children clamber through a new park and a peaceful watershed, where paddlers and joggers ease along the thick greenery. “I still think back to the moment when those plants were discovered. It was joyful. I actually cried when I heard about it and when I heard of the care that the machine operators took. In other projects, everything is just scraped away. But the people working on the machines were so very kind,” said Charles. “This whole project has become a celebration, because who would have thought that underneath meters and meters of contaminated soil were these seeds waiting to come back to life? It’s a reminder to us all of what is possible.”", "tags": ["toronto", "canada", "plants", "wetlands", "americas", "features"]},

About 540 square miles of land have been cleared for mining in the South American country since 1984, and the environmental destruction is spreading rapidly across the country, Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP) and its Peruvian partner organisation, Conservación Amazónica, found. The gold rush is also poisoning its waterways. Illegal miners use dredges – floating machines that chew up and spit out riverbeds – leaving the toxic mercury used to extract gold from sediment in their wake. Ultra-high resolution aerial images allowed MAAP, part of Amazon  , to identify dredges alongside deforestation for the first time, enabling them to identify goldminers and revealing that the environmental crisis once confined to the south of the country was creeping north. “We used to only see it in the Madre de Dios region but now we’re seeing it everywhere”, said MAAP’s director, Matt Finer.

MAAP’s analysis found that 225 rivers and streams have been affected, with 989 dredges spotted in Loreto since 2017 – including 275 this year alone on the Nanay River, a tributary of the Amazon that is the lifeblood of ecosystems and  “They are poisoning our rivers – it’s the water that we drink,” said Roberto Tafur Shupingahua, a representative of several riverside communities in Loreto. Shupingahua said local communities began blocking miners from advancing up the River Tigre in Loreto 40 days ago, leading to gunfights with armed intruders. “We have no choice but to fight back but we are alone.

MAAP’s report showed more dredges appearing on Peru’s jungle frontiers with Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia. With gold prices surpassing $4,000 an ounce, foreign, armed groups are increasingly venturing across the border into Peru’s lawless jungles where local authorities are doing little to stop them, says Bram Ebus, a criminologist and consultant for the International Crisis Group. Criminal networks, including the   Colombia and Comando Vermelho from Brazil, are increasingly active across the border. “International crime networks trafficking cocaine and laundering profits through illegal gold mining – now with peak prices providing hefty returns – are combined with a government in Lima that has not been a serious obstacle against organised crime,” Ebus said.

There’s an amazing lineup of collaborators and stars, and it’s good to see Candy’s uniquely likable and buoyant screen personality, but the tone borders on the stultifyingly reverential. Candy was the much loved Canadian actor and comic who was a star graduate of Toronto’s Second City comedy troupe and its small screen offshoot SCTV; he was a contemporary of Dan Aykroyd, Catherine O’Hara and  , and went on to star in movies such as Stripes, Uncle Buck and Planes, Trains and Automobiles. His death in 1994 at 43 was due to a heart attack caused by his weight issues, and drinking and smoking (though the movie rather prissily overlooks his cocaine use). The film’s sub-title is taken from   from Candy’s maladroit character in Planes, Trains and Automobiles after he has just been cruelly insulted by Steve Martin: “I like me, my wife likes me, my customers like me, ’cause I’m the real article.” The documentary as a whole is perhaps a little too ready to conflate that sweet character with Candy himself, who was a little more complex, more pessimistic and fatalistic after the traumatising death of his father from a heart attack at the age of 35 (when Candy himself was just five), and knowing that his successful career in comedy movies depended on being big. Candy got his break when he was cast by Steven Spielberg in 1941, and maybe he could have been a Spielbergian figure in cinema; instead, the director that took him up was John Hughes, who cast him in Planes, Trains and Automobiles, Uncle Buck and many more films. But it was Ron Howard who tapped further his sunny good nature by casting him opposite   in Splash, and there was some very interesting bromance chemistry between them. Candy had a natural face for the movies – open, ingenuous, boyish and trusting – although I left this documentary suspecting that nothing he did for the big screen was as funny as the appalling character he did on SCTV: Yellowbelly, the cowardly cowboy who actually shoots a small child in the back.

Wall Street fell sharply after the US president reignited public tensions with the Chinese government, and raised the prospect of another acrimonious trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Over the summer,  , and Trump agreed to drastically reduce steep tariffs he imposed on China earlier this year, following negotiations between the two countries. Late on Friday, however, the president threatened to ratchet them back up by imposing a 100% tariff on goods from   “over and above” any existing tariffs. This would happen on 1 November “or sooner”, he said, hinting that the move could be accelerated should Chinese officials opt to retaliate. The US will also introduce export controls on “any and all critical software”, he added. “I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social website, claiming: “Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the USA. “One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of   on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.” A planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month may no longer happen, Trump suggested, saying “there seems to be no reason” to meet with the Chinese president. The US president’s threat sets the stage for another escalation in his volatile dispute with China. Just four months ago, he described US relations with the country as “excellent” after  . Trump repeatedly hiked US tariffs on Chinese goods in the spring, amid spiraling tensions between the two countries, to a peak of 145%. Beijing hit back, raising its own tariffs on US exports to 125%. But talks between officials, amid widespread concern over the impact of such exorbitant duties on the world economy, led to a fragile detente. US tariffs on Chinese products fell to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US goods dropped to 10%. The president’s latest online attack on Beijing alarmed investors on Friday. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 2.7%, suffering its worst day since April, and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 1.9% in New York, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite sank 3.6%.

Other leading global markets also came under pressure. The FTSE 100 dropped 0.9% in London. China is the world’s largest producer of rare earths, producing more than 90% of the world’s processed rare earths and rare-earth magnets. The 17 elements are critical for manufacturers of everything from electric cars to plane engines. Earlier this week, Beijing significantly expanded its export controls over rare earths, adding five new materials to its control list. Its last expansion of controls, back in April, prompted supply shortages around the world before a series of diplomatic deals helped resolve some of the issues. “I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!” Trump claimed on Friday. “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets’ and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least. “But the US has Monopoly positions also, much stronger and more far reaching than China’s.” Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy is a key pillar of his policy agenda. He has claimed higher taxes on imports from across the world will strengthen the US economy and raise trillions of dollars for the federal government.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/07/indian-factory-workers-fast-fashion-recycling-panipat-discarded-clothing", "content": "he air inside Panipat’s recycling factories is heavy with lint that glints in the light before settling over every surface like a film of dirty snow. At her work station, 27-year-old Neerma Devi cuts through collars and seams, tugging sleeves apart and feeding scraps of used clothes into a roaring machine. Each cut unleashes another cloud of lint into the room. Her dupatta is wound tightly across her face to stop her breathing in the fibres, but she says it does little. By the end of her shift, her chest is tight and her skin itches, and some nights she is left choking for breath. This suffocating world is the backbone of a global trade. Panipat, in north  , is known as the “castoff capital of the world”. Shipments of discarded clothing from Europe, North America and east Asia are shredded here by thousands of workers, spun back into yarn and woven into rugs, throws, sheets and cushions destined for international retailers. Nearly six years ago, Devi left Hardoi, a town 300 miles away, and came to Panipat with her husband, lured by the promise of steady mill work. Today, she works six days a week, often with her young sons by her side due to the lack of on-site childcare facilities. But the clothes she recycles each day are making her sick. The coughing lingers long after she leaves the factory, and visits to the doctor have become routine. “The doctor tells me it’s because of all this dust I breathe every day,” she says. “He gives me medicine, but it only works while I take it. Once I stop, the coughing comes back. He says I should leave this work. But I can’t afford to.” Panipat recycles approximately   annually through its  , diverting large volumes of discarded textiles that might otherwise end up in landfill worldwide. Shipments arriving through ports in Gujarat are transported here, where the clothes are first sorted: garments that are wearable are diverted to markets, while the bulk are shredded and spun back into yarn. The fibres are then bleached, dyed and woven, mostly into home furnishings, and exported across the world. “All grades of material – from polyester track pants to cotton shirts – are shredded together into what is called ‘shoddy yarn’,” says Ina Bharguna, programme manager at the Estonia-based Reverse Resources, which has been monitoring textile waste in the city. “It is never free of microplastics.” International studies have shown that   – especially nylon – impairs the repair and growth of airway epithelial cells, posing serious risks to lung tissue. A   found that inhaled nano- and microplastics can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract, potentially contributing to diseases such as asthma, fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Devi’s father-in-law, the first in the family to move to Panipat nearly two decades ago, spent years working in one of the city’s mills and now lives with advanced COPD. His lung damage is so severe that even swallowing food triggers choking or pain as he struggles to breathe. Doctors at the local government hospital have told the family the damage is irreversible. Devi’s husband, Kailash Kumar, still works in the same mill where his father worked – fully aware of the damage it can cause. Kumar describes the factory as an enclosed chamber with barely any ventilation. “There are no masks, no covers,” he says. Doctors have warned him that years of breathing this air could leave him with the same condition his father suffers from. A government doctor overseeing tuberculosis control in the city, who requested anonymity, says lung disease and COPD are alarmingly common. “Most of the patients we see have spent years in the textile factories,” he says. “They breathe in dust, fibres and chemicals every day. Microfibres settle in their lungs with continuous exposure, and many are never properly diagnosed. That makes them far more vulnerable – not just to infections like tuberculosis, but also to long-term chronic lung diseases.” Ramesh Chawdhary, a senior official in Haryana’s labour department, agrees that conditions inside many factories are dire. “The working environment is insufferable,” he says. “We routinely come across cases of breathing issues, migraine, skin infections, even cancer. Prolonged exposure in such conditions takes its toll, regardless of the minimal labour protections in place. Most factory owners do not prioritise worker safety. The risks are even higher in bleaching and dyeing units, where labourers handle toxic chemicals such as sulphuric acid with their bare hands.” But the factory owner where Devi works dismisses concerns about the environment. “We don’t use any chemicals here – it is just dust and lint. How can that cause anything serious? A little cough and cold is common,” he says. He adds that while the factory does provide masks, most workers avoid them, complaining that they feel suffocated when wearing them. The damage to human health is also not limited to those working within the factories. On the outskirts of Panipat, scores of bleaching units cater for growing demand to bleach textile scraps before they are shredded and made into yarn. The city has   registered dyeing units and at least 200 more that operate illegally. An estimated   from these units is released directly into the environment, contaminating surface and groundwater. Official records note   around the city empty directly into Drain No 2 – a major industrial channel that feeds into the Yamuna River – adding significantly to its toxic load as it flows downstream through Delhi. In April, Laboratory tests by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board found pollutant levels far above the Central Pollution Control Board’s limits. For instance, water samples from the drain contained nearly four times the permissible level of dissolved solids, along with critically low oxygen levels – less than half the standard required – making the stretch uninhabitable for aquatic life.

A   noted that groundwater in the city was polluted with manganese, lead, nitrate and fluoride in some parts and with heavy metals including cadmium, nickel, zinc and copper, at many places. Nitin Arora, president of the Dyers Association in Panipat, disputes claims that units cause pollution. “The state pollution control board exists with such strict regulations, how can anyone operate units without compliance? Maybe it was bad before, but not now.” artej Singh, who lives in a village on the edge of Panipat’s urban sprawl, shut down his borewell after discovering the groundwater was unsafe to drink. “Here, water has become our biggest curse. Every borewell near this drain only brings suffering – people fall sick, and disease spreads,” he says. Villagers in the area   skin ailments, and in some cases even cancer, which residents believe is linked to the contaminated water. In a  conducted near Panipat’s textile clusters, nearly 93% of families reported serious health problems in the past five years with a surge in noncommunicable diseases. High blood pressure, diabetes and cardiovascular complications are now widespread. Skin conditions such as rashes and eczema are more commonly reported, particularly among children and women who handle laundry or fetch water. Environmentalist Varun Gulati, who has been petitioning authorities to act on Panipat’s industrial pollution, says water treatment before disposal is almost nonexistent. “Effluent treatment plants are a rarity,” he says. Haryana’s pollution control board and central pollution control board have both raised concerns about   in Panipat found to be discharging untreated waste directly into the city’s water system. In a court order, India’s National Green Tribunal – a specialised environmental court – took up the case on its own motion and found that 31 of the 32 bleaching and dyeing units were operating illegally and contributing directly to water pollution. In August, the tribunal ordered their closure. But according to Gulati, such orders are ineffective. “In the past five years, around 150 illegal bleaching houses have been shut down,” he says. But the bans are temporary, enforcement is inconsistent, and officials are too few to keep up. “Units shut down under one name [only to] reappear under another.” Out of a total of   calculated by the pollution board, only about 3.7bn rupees has ever been recovered. “Even when fines are levied, they are either reduced, left uncollected, or never enforced,” says Gulati. In March, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, called Panipat “a global hub of textile recycling”. But the cost of this solution to fast fashion is etched into the bodies of workers and locals. “It scares us to think we could end up like my father-in-law. But for now, this is the only way to survive,” says Devi.", "tags": ["global", "development", "india", "recycling", "garment", "workers", "waste", "ethical", "and", "green", "living", "employment", "features"]},

Their daily rituals, making rotis over open fires and nursing their livestock, unfold in intimate, unhurried scenes. These routines are deeply in communion with nature, but the landscape has irrevocably shifted, threatening their very existence. A drought rages, leaving little water for Ahmed’s ailing animals. Climate change is not the only cause; in impressionistic wide shots, we see glimpses of wind turbines and factories, private enterprises that turn the surrounding environment into barren land. Moreover, while laws allocate grazing ground for cows and buffalo, no such measures are provided for those with camels, goats and sheep. Malnourished, Ahmed’s herd grows increasingly sick. In a heartbreaking turn, mounting debts and medical costs soon force him to sell most of his livestock. Though critical of modern commerce, Sumaria’s film does not romanticise tradition.

The most recent shooting took place on Tuesday night after unidentified gunmen drove past a group of people in the capital, Kingston, and opened fire. Six people, including two nine-year-old children and two teenagers, were shot, according to the Kingston Central police superintendent Beresford Williams. It was later reported that one of the teenagers died on Wednesday morning.

The vote fell mostly along party lines, 48-51, with two Republicans,   and Lisa Murkowski, voting in favor and the Democrat John Fetterman voting against. It was the first vote in Congress on Trump’s military campaign, which according to the White House has so far destroyed four vessels, killed at least 21 people and stopped narcotics from reaching the US. The war powers resolution would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes on the cartels. The   has asserted that drug traffickers are armed combatants threatening the United States, creating justification to use military force. But that assertion has been met with some unease on Capitol Hill. Some   are asking the White House for more clarification on its legal justification and specifics on how the strikes are conducted, while Democrats insist they are violations of US and international law. It is a clash that could redefine how the world’s most powerful military uses lethal force and set the tone for future global conflict. The White House had indicated Trump would veto the legislation, and even though the Senate vote failed, it gave lawmakers an opportunity to go on the record with their objections to Trump’s declaration that the US is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels. “It sends a message when a significant number of legislators say: ‘Hey, this is a bad idea,’” said Senator  , a Virginia Democrat who pushed the resolution alongside Adam Schiff, a Democrat of California. Wednesday’s vote was brought under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was intended to reassert congressional power over the declaration of war. “Congress must not allow the executive branch to become judge, jury and executioner,” Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has long pushed for greater congressional oversight of war powers, said during a floor speech. Paul was the only Republican to publicly speak in favor of the resolution before the vote, but a number of Republican senators have questioned the strikes on vessels and said they are not receiving enough information from the administration. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, acknowledged “there may be some concern” in the Republican conference about the strikes. However, Republican leaders stridently argued against the resolution on the Senate floor Wednesday, calling it a political ploy from  . “People were attacking our country by bringing in poisonous substances to deposit into our country that would have killed Americans,” said Senator Jim Risch, the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee. “Fortunately most of those drugs are now at the bottom of the ocean.” Risch thanked Trump for his actions and added that he hoped the military strikes would continue. Members of the Senate armed services committee received a classified briefing last week on the strikes, and Cramer said he was “comfortable with at least the plausibility of their legal argument”. But, he added, no one representing intelligence agencies or the military command structure for Central and South America was present for the briefing. “I’d be more comfortable defending the administration if they shared the information,” he said. Kaine also said the briefing did not include any information on why the military chose to destroy the vessels rather than interdict them or get into the specifics of how the military was so confident the vessels were carrying drugs. “Maybe they were engaged in human trafficking, or maybe it was the wrong ship,” Schiff said. “We just have little or no information about who was onboard these ships or what intelligence was used or what the rationale was and how certain we could be that everyone on that ship deserved to die.” The Democrats also said the administration had told them it was adding cartels to a list of organizations deemed “narco-terrorists” that are targets for military strikes, but it had not shown the lawmakers a complete list. “The slow erosion of congressional oversight is not an abstract debate about process,” Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate armed services committee, said in a floor speech. “It is a real and present threat to our democracy.” The secretary of state,  , visited the Republican conference for lunch on Wednesday to emphasize to senators that they should vote against the legislation. He told the senators that the administration was treating cartels like governmental entities because they had seized control of large portions of some Caribbean nations, according to Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota. Rubio told reporters at the Capitol: “These drug-trafficking organizations are a direct threat to the safety and security of the United States to unleash violence and criminality on our streets, fueled by the drugs and the drug profits that they make. … And the president, as the commander in chief, has an obligation to keep our country safe.” Still, Democrats said the recent buildup of US maritime forces in the Caribbean was a sign of shifting US priorities and tactics that could have grave repercussions. They worried that further military strikes could set off a conflict with   and argued that Congress should be actively deliberating whenever American troops are sent to war. Schiff said, “This is the kind of thing that leads a country, unexpectedly and unintentionally, into war.”", "tags": ["us", "senate", "donald", "trump", "venezuela", "drugs", "us", "military", "trump", "administration", "us", "congress", "news"]},

The court in Buenos Aires also sentenced the man’s accomplice to eight years in prison, capping a dramatic case that has captivated the country since 2022, when the main defendant, Fernando Sabag Montiel, squeezed through a crowd outside the ex-president’s home, thrust a loaded gun at her face and pulled the trigger. The gun did not go off. Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina’s vice-president at the time, was unharmed. The botched assassination attempt provoked street protests from Fernández de Kirchner’s diehard supporters as well as scepticism and conspiracy theories from her fervent critics. Among Latin America’s best-known politicians with three decades at the forefront of Argentinian politics and two terms as president from 2007 to 2015, Fernández de Kirchner is a deeply polarising figure whose brand of leftwing populism brought Argentina infamy for its runaway inflation and enormous fiscal deficits.

Fernández de Kirchner has long rejected the corruption charges as politically motivated.

The prosecution produced WhatsApp chats about the firearm and evidence that the former couple visited Fernández de Kirchner’s house before the attack to observe her routines and security. At the time of the shooting, Fernández de Kirchner was standing trial for corruption and crowds rallied regularly outside her home in solidarity. The former president’s supporters managed to catch Sabag Montiel as he tried to flee the scene after firing the defective gun.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-china-trade-war-soybeans", "content": "At the Purfeerst farm in southern  , the soybean harvest just wrapped up for the season. The silver grain bins are full of about 100,000 bushels of soybeans, which grab about $10 a piece. This year, though, the fate of the soybeans, and the people whose livelihoods depend on selling them, is up in the air: America’s soybean farmers are stuck in the middle of a trade war between the US and  , the biggest purchaser of soybean exports, used to feed China’s pigs. “We are gonna have to find a home for them soybeans some time soon,” said Matt Purfeerst, a fifth-generation farmer on the family’s land. “They won’t stay in our bins for ever.” No other country comes close to purchasing as many American soybeans as China – last year, it was more than $12bn worth. This year, the country has not purchased a single dollar’s worth, cutting off the country that makes up about half of US soybean exports. While Trump has said he intends some sort of payment to go to soybean farmers hurt by tariffs, an announcement of a specific plan is   while the government is shut down. He said in a Truth Social post last week that he would be meeting with the Chinese president soon and “soybeans will be a major topic of discussion”. The White House cast blame on Democrats for the government shutdown for the delay in a response to the Guardian on Wednesday, erroneously claiming they were prioritizing healthcare for migrants over farmers. “President Trump, [Treasury] Secretary [Scott] Bessent, and [Agriculture] Secretary [Brooke] Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the president’s November victory,” spokeswoman Anna Kelly said. “Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress have stalled progress on this issue with their prolonged shutdown to serve illegal immigrants instead of America’s farmers. No decisions have been made, but we look forward to sharing good news soon.” Purfeerst’s family farm grows soybeans and corn, and has some beef cattle. The job is a round-the-clock combination of engineering, business, manual labor, environmental science. And it’s increasingly hard for family farms to make it. Costs for propane, fertilizer and seed have gone up, he said, and the prices for the goods they are selling don’t make up for the increased costs. Soybean farmers have become the “poster child out there right now of how this one particular segment’s getting hurt”, he said. The farm recently welcomed the Democratic US senator Amy Klobuchar for a visit to talk about how the tariffs were playing out, but Purfeerst said political affiliations didn’t matter. “Only 1% of the population is even involved in [agriculture] any more,” he said. “And what gets really challenging is this perception of ag out there, whether it’s on tariffs and prices or environmental issues, farmers kind of seem to be the crosshairs of a lot of it.” Farming areas voted for Trump in 2024, as did much of rural America. One analysis,  , showed Trump growing his support among farming-dependent counties in 2024 despite a trade war during his first term that negatively affected farmers. “I’m not gonna get into who I voted for particularly, but I would just have to say, at the time, you got to make decisions who you think is going to be the best leader of the country, and go on with life,” Purfeerst said. “And in four years, you get to vote again. That’s the beauty of our society. It’s not an 80-year regime. It’s a four-year cycle. It’s hard to say what’s gonna come about. I mean, everyone’s got their pros and cons.” Purfeerst has options for his soybeans: because of his farm’s location, he can sell domestically to soybean crush facilities in nearby towns, sell on the rail market, or sell in Minneapolis and put product on barges down the Mississippi River. Other soybean farmers, especially those in more remote parts of the midwest where soybeans are mostly produced, aren’t as lucky. Stories from all parts of the country where soybeans are grown have surfaced in recent weeks – in Arkansas, Illinois, Nebraska, Indiana, the Dakotas. Farmers face higher costs for inputs like fertilizer and equipment. They rely on China as a purchaser. Soybeans sitting in bins too long is subject to weather and pests. The prices fluctuate, so it’s a gamble to hold on to it that sometimes can pay off, or sometimes lose money. “Let’s say tomorrow we get a trade deal with China, and it’s favorable to soybeans. All of a sudden you might see this market jump from $10 to $12 in three, four days,” Purfeerst said. “So it makes it extremely challenging from a risk management standpoint of: when do you market your crop, and how many eggs do you put in that basket? The potential is $12, but if we don’t get a trade deal, it could go to $9 … There’s a huge volatility in soybeans.” The soybean industry has been warning for months that China’s exit from the market would be devastating, calling on the Trump administration to come up with a trade deal that spares farmers. The American Soybean Association   to Trump in August, saying the country’s soybean farmers were “standing at a trade and financial precipice” and “cannot survive a prolonged trade dispute with our largest customer”. Tim Walz, Minnesota’s Democratic governor, declared the first week of October as soybean week, saying in the announcement that “our soybean farmers are confronting a crisis they haven’t seen since the 1980s”. “They’ve produced a bumper crop this year, just to find out they have nowhere to sell their harvest thanks to Trump’s trade policies,” Walz said. “Minnesota’s got the best beans in the world – I encourage Minnesotans to stand with our farmers and continue to advocate for federal trade reform.” It’s not the first time a Trump trade plan has hurt soybean farmers: in 2018, a trade war led to significant reductions in soybean exports to China. Since then, the market has rebounded, though China has   soybean purchases from Brazil and Argentina, stockpiling imports earlier this year. Republican lawmakers have said they are sympathetic to the farmers and want to find a way to help them. James Comer, a Republican congressman from Kentucky, said this week that soybean farmers were not to blame for the problem they are facing. “They planted that crop assuming that those foreign markets were going to be there,” Comer  . “I think we need to do something to help the soybean farmers.” A bailout is “really just a Band-Aid”, though it’s one that many farmers would welcome as they are getting squeezed right now, Purfeerst said. Most farmers would prefer an open market, without tariffs, for their products, letting the market dictate prices. They don’t want the trade war now to affect a long-term relationship that makes up a significant chunk of market share. There also should be more emphasis put on increasing domestic uses of soybeans, though a long-range plan like that won’t help the farmers who are stuck right now, he said. “There’s farms that are struggling to make money on soybean acres, and you’ve got to remember: whatever payment we’re getting, whatever that dollar amount might be, if we get anything, it’s not just going in our back pocket,” he said. “We’ve got a fertilizer bill. We’ve got to pay the seed bill. There’s a lot of payments. So really, that money might be in the farmer’s hands for a month, until it gets spent on inputs for next year.”", "tags": ["trump", "tariffs", "us", "politics", "farming", "minnesota", "us", "foreign", "policy", "china", "donald", "trump", "news"]},

Speaking on his two-day trip to Mumbai, where he met an expert on India’s digital ID system, Starmer defended the introduction of a similar measure in the UK, saying he believed the rollout of a voluntary system could be expanded to school applications, mortgages and driving licences. Starmer met Nandan Nilekani, the non-exec chair of the tech company Infosys, to discuss the speed of the rollout in India and the transformation of the benefits system, which has cut bureaucracy – but also caused significant contention over the exclusion of some minorities. India’s version of the scheme – Aadhaar – has been introduced over the past 15 years to almost all of its 1.4bn citizens. Starmer’s spokesperson said the meeting was not about a potential commercial arrangement with Infosys, adding that the government aimed to build its own version of the scheme in the public sector. But his interest in the Indian scheme will be taken as another sign that the government hopes the ID scheme will be part of the UK benefits system in time. Speaking to reporters en route to Mumbai, Starmer said he hoped digital IDs, which have   since his announcement, would regain public confidence because of the convenience they could provide. “I don’t know how many times the rest of you have had to look in the bottom drawer for three bills when you want to get your kids into school or apply for this or apply for that, drives me to frustration,” he said. “I do think that we could gain a significant advantage. We’re going to a country, India, where they’ve already done ID and made a massive success of it. So one of the meetings I’ll be having is about ID, in relation to that.” The digital ID system in India is far more extensive than that announced by the UK government and holds biometric data as well as residential and contact information. Government sources said there was no intention to copy the system, but to examine the way it was used and implemented, handling 80m transactions a day. It is considered a success, albeit with controversial implications, with estimates it has saved the Indian economy about £11bn in administration and corruption costs. Citizens are given a 12-digit identifying number, which replaces the need for multiple layers of paper documentation to prove their status when they take out bank accounts or apply for state benefits. Prior to the scheme, millions of babies would routinely not be registered at birth, leaving people struggling to access benefits or ways to prove their existence later in life. Critics of the Indian scheme said it was introduced with little protection for personal data, and has caused problems among the poorest citizens, with some said to have been denied medical care or benefits for not having the ID. Phone companies and banks have in some instances threatened to shut down accounts not linked to ID numbers, though a supreme court ruling has said it should not be mandatory for private services or education. Activists have also reported it being used to disenfranchise Muslim voters in the north of the country. Starmer’s spokesperson said the meeting was held because it was “useful to hear from the Indian experience; it has a very different inception and a different system, but it is used 80m times a day”. Asked about some of the controversies with the Indian system, he said the UK system would have a different design – there are no plans to use biometric data so far. “One of core priorities is inclusivity and that’s what the British consultation will be about,” he said. Starmer said the scheme was essential to tackle illegal working, as the ID would be mandatory for employment, but that he hoped it would become a voluntary convenience measure for most British citizens.

Rightwing parties have put the spotlight on gig economy companies such as UberEats and Deliveroo, where migrant workers have been able to use false identities to work. “We have to have returns agreements with countries, as we’ve got with France, and we need to address the fact that too many people can come to this country and work illegally,” Starmer said. “And that’s why ID mandatory for working is really important. “There is a case to be made about the benefits for voluntary ID into other areas, and obviously we need to make that case. I think it’s a really important discussion for us to have. So on the one hand, it’s mandatory for work, but I actually think it would be a good passport.” The government has not identified any private provider that can take part in the scheme, with the tech company   saying it would not do so because the plan was not in the Labour manifesto and therefore had no mandate. All opposition parties have said they would oppose the scheme, and there remain significant misgivings among some Labour MPs about the possibility of snowballing costs and data breaches.

Starmer will meet his Indian counterpart,  , on Thursday and make a keynote address at a fintech conference. The prime minister told a business delegation of more than 120 chief executives and cultural leaders that he hoped each one of them would have a deal to sign by the end of the trip. On a visit to a Bollywood production studio, Starmer announced three new Bollywood blockbusters would be made in the UK from next year by Yash Raj Films, creating more than 3,000 jobs. No 10 said deals signed during the trip would create about 7,000 jobs through Indian investment in the UK. Speaking at a visit to a football ground, Starmer denied business leaders had been pressing for liberalisation of visa rules. “None of them have raised with me the question of visas. That wasn’t part of the FTA (free trade agreement),” he said. “What this is about is providing opportunities for them to take advantage of the FTA, and even before it’s fully enforced, the mood is very, very strong between India and the UK.”", "tags": ["identity", "cards", "keir", "starmer", "india", "narendra", "modi", "trade", "policy", "south", "and", "central", "asia", "news"]},

The ministry of the environment and Stats NZ’s three-yearly update,  , collates statistics, data and research across five domains – air, atmosphere and climate, freshwater, land, and marine – to paint a picture of the state of New Zealand’s marine environment. The latest in the series,  , painted a sobering picture for the country’s oceans and coasts – one defined by warming and rising seas, intensifying marine heatwaves and ocean acidification, brought about by global heating. “Climate change isn’t just something far and distant … it has impacts on our ocean and on our coast,” Dr Alison Collins, the ministry’s chief science adviser, told the Guardian. “The coastal zone is under a real squeeze … and the importance of that coastal environment is absolutely critical – it’s what we rely on in terms of our homes, our communities, our livelihoods and ultimately our connection to place.” The report presented a wide array of risks associated with the marine changes, including threats to indigenous marine species, coastal inundation and flooding of homes, as well as stronger and more devastating storms, and risks to communities and the economy. It noted 219,000 homes worth $180bn were located in coastal inundation and inland flood zones, while more than $26bn worth of infrastructure was vulnerable to damage. About 1,300 coastal homes could face significant damage from extreme weather. Some regions will experience a rise of 20cm to 30cm in sea levels by 2050, a tipping point for some communities, Collins said. “Sea levels that reach that height mean that a coastal storm that used to happen every 100 years could start happening every year,” she said. The world’s oceans have been absorbing about   created from the human-caused climate crisis. New Zealand is bearing the brunt of these warming seas because of its position in the ocean, which makes it more vulnerable to atmospheric circulation and changes in ocean currents. Between 1982 and 2023, New Zealand’s sea-surface temperatures in its four ocean regions increased, on average, 0.16 to 0.26 degrees Celsius per decade, and its rate of ocean warming outstripped global averages by 34%. Coastal waters are also warming faster than the global average, it said. Meanwhile, the Subtropical Front – the boundary between cold subantarctic water and warmer subtropical water that is biologically and economically significant – has moved 120km west, the report said, noting it was the first time a shift in large-scale ocean circulation around New Zealand had been observed. The shift, which is driven by warming water, will have “huge impacts” on ecosystems, the food-web and on species such as corals, sponges, kelp and fish, Collins said. Ocean acidification and warming are also affecting the country’s fishing and aquaculture industries – which contribute $1.1bn to the economy – and can lead to toxic algae bloom in shellfish. Marine heatwaves, meanwhile, are becoming more intense, longer lasting and more frequent. New Zealand has been hit with   in recent years, which have been linked to  , die-offs of  , large scale   and  . Monitoring and research into the marine environment was growing but there were still gaps in understanding, the report noted, adding that more comprehensive research would reduce risk to people, foster climate resilience, and promote sustainability. Of particular concern was a lack of understanding into how climate change, oceans, severe weather events and ecosystems interact, Collins said. “It is a bit like pulling a thread from a fabric and the whole thing can sort of fall apart – understanding those interactions is perhaps the biggest blind spot for us.”", "tags": ["new", "zealand", "climate", "crisis", "asia", "pacific", "oceans", "news"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/gustavo-petro-colombia-boats-us-military", "content": "Colombia’s president has drawn Washington’s ire after accusing the US of killing Colombian citizens during a recent boat strike in the Caribbean Sea. “A new theatre of war has opened up: the Caribbean,” Gustavo Petro wrote on his official X account on Wednesday night. The US has launched at least four deadly aerial attacks on alleged drug trafficking boats crossing the waterway since early September, when 11 people were killed in the first strike. The South American country’s leftwing leader claimed there were “indications” that   was Colombian “and had Colombians onboard”. “I hope their families come forwards to report this,” added Petro, a fierce critic of Donald Trump, without offering further details or evidence. Since the US began its strikes in the Caribbean at least 21 people have reportedly lost their lives. On Friday, the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said four “narco-terrorists” were   “just off the coast of Venezuela” as they transported “substantial amounts of [US-bound] narcotics”. However, the names of those killed on the supposed “narco-boats” have not been released and Trump officials have failed to provide any proof that the victims were involved in smuggling drugs to the US. The White House pushed back against Petro’s claims,   he publicly retract “his baseless and reprehensible statement” about the boat attack. But two US officials, who were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly,   that Colombians were on at least one of the boats recently destroyed by the US. Petro urged the White House to release the names of those killed by US strikes “so I can see if my information is unfounded”. Washington claims its strikes – which are part of a major military buildup in the Caribbean Sea – are part of a large-scale crackdown on Venezuelan narco groups it accuses of flooding the US with cocaine. However, the decision to deploy warships and thousands of marines off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast has left many observers many wondering if the operation is actually a pretext to depose Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro. “The deployment is vastly disproportionate to any real counter-narcotics mission. So this really looks, walks and talks like a regime change preparation,” Juan González, the White House’s former top Latin America official,   this week. González, who served under Joe Biden, said that by some estimates “roughly 10% of naval assets” had been sent to the region. On Wednesday, Maduro, who Trump failed to topple during his first term, warned that his troops were preparing for a possible attempt at regime change. “If the gringos attack, we will respond.” Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said he was braced for a variety of scenarios including drone attacks, an air campaign or acts of sabotage or targeted assassinations carried out by US special forces. Writing on Wednesday, Petro claimed “the war” playing out in the Caribbean Sea was not about drug smuggling but oil, a commodity of which Venezuela boasts the world’s largest reserves. “The world must stop this,” Petro added. “This aggression is aimed at the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean.” On Thursday, Grenada’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed it ha​d received a request from the US for the “temporary installation of radar equipment and associated technical personnel”. The confirmation followed days of speculation by local media that the US was going to ask the country to host military assets to help with their operations in the southern Caribbean. While some Caribbean nations, such as Trinidad and Tobago, have welcomed the US’s military presence in the region, others have described it as a threat to peace and security. The Venezuela-backed Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America trade bloc, of which Grenada is a member, had condemned the US deployment of warships as a “flagrant violation” of international law. In its statement, Grenada said it was carefully reviewing the request and would only make a decision after “technical and legal assessments”.", "tags": ["colombia", "americas", "venezuela", "us", "military", "news"]},

It will reportedly cut travel time across the canyon from two hours to two minutes, taking the Guizhou S57 highway from Liuzhi special district to Anlong county. But authorities also hope it will attract tourists to the region, with viewing platforms, a glass lift to a cafe on top of one of the bridge arches, and a glass walkway for visitors to look down to the ground about 580 metres below.

One user described cars looking “as small as ants” driving across the bridge. “Sitting in the car, it felt as if I could reach out and touch the clouds with my hand,” said another. Not everyone is so enamoured. Some people have complained on social media about the bridge’s cost, parking management and unfinished state, while others say it was “not worth the special trip”. The bridge took less than four years to build, and supplanted another Chinese bridge – also in Guizhou province – as the world’s highest.

Writing on X, Machado dedicated the prize to “the suffering people of   and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!” She said the prize was “an impetus to conclude our task: to conquer freedom”. “We are on the threshold of victory and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve freedom and democracy.” The Nobel committee celebrated Machado’s long struggle for democracy in a statement that called her “one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times”. It also paid tribute to the Venezuelan opposition’s “innovative and brave, peaceful and democratic” push for change during last year’s election, when hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised to observe the election and  “But the regime refused to accept the election result, and clung to power,” the committee said, painting a dire picture of life in Venezuela, which has gradually sunk into dictatorship since Maduro was democratically elected in 2013 after the death of his mentor, Hugo Chávez. “Venezuela has evolved from a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal, authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis,” the committee said. “Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty, even as the few at the top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against the country’s own citizens. Nearly 8 million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution and imprisonment.” Machado, whom many Venezuelans know simply as MCM or María Corina, has been involved in politics for more than two decades and was a member of Venezuela’s national assembly from 2011 to 2014. She   with Chávez over Venezuela’s economic tribulations in 2012, earning the rebuke: “Eagles don’t hunt flies.” But it was in touring the economically devastated country by car and motorbike in the lead-up to the 2024 election that she cemented her reputation as Chavismo’s most effective and influential adversary. Her rallies drew huge, ecstatic crowds, with many supporters declaring an almost religious devotion to the charismatic Catholic politician, who promised to reunite millions of Venezuelan families separated by the mass migration triggered by Venezuela’s economic meltdown under Maduro. “She connected with people on the one issue that matters to people – which is family,” said Burelli, noting how Machado’s relatives had also been forced to flee abroad. “Everybody understands that she is in the same boat.” Machado had originally hoped to run for president, but Venezuela’s pro-regime supreme court banned her from doing so, leaving González, a little-known former ambassador, to fill her shoes. “She will go down in history as the great opposition leader of our times … whether she makes it to the presidency or not,” said Carlos Lizarralde, the author of Venezuela’s Collapse: The Long Story of How Things Fell Apart​. The committee commended Machado as a “brave and committed champion of peace” who had kept “the flame of democracy burning during a growing darkness”. It also celebrated her as “a key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided”. For all her popular support, however, Machado is not universally liked. Some Venezuelans distrust her as a result of thinly veiled calls for a foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro in the past. She argued in 2019 that only a   of the use of international force would convince Maduro to leave power. David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela specialist, said: “María Corina Machado has shown incredible courage in fighting for democracy. In 2023-24 she heroically mobilised the Venezuelan population for presidential elections. However, much of her fight before then and since then has been through non-democratic means, seeking to generate international military intervention.” Others are suspicious of her ties to radical rightwing politicians such as Trump and Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro, and   for Trump’s widely discredited claim that a Venezuelan gang, the Tren de Aragua – has launched an “invasion” of the US. Trump and top officials such as Stephen Miller have used that spurious claim as justification for its campaign against Venezuelan migrants – scores of whom were deported to a high-security prison in authoritarian El Salvador – and for   in the Caribbean that have killed at least 21 people. Maduro and his allies mockingly refer to Machado as “La Sayona” [“the sackcloth woman”] – the name of a hideous female ghost from Venezuelan folklore who roams the country taking violent revenge on unfaithful husbands. Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow on Latin America at Chatham House, said Maduro would be furious at the Nobel committee’s decision. “The question is, what now? Will it prompt public demonstrations in favour of María Corina Machado that [heap] some sort of public pressure on the government? Perhaps,” he said. “I think they would be hard-pressed to crack down with the international community [watching], but they did it in July 2024.” Burelli said he believed the award would shield his friend from possible arrest or persecution as she continued her fight for change. “This now truly protects her,” he said, arguing that the cost of targeting her would be “unbearable” for Maduro’s regime. “Now, I think she is bulletproof.”", "tags": ["nobel", "peace", "prize", "maría", "corina", "machado", "venezuela", "norway", "europe", "americas", "news"]},

Research by Amnesty International released on Thursday found current immigration systems are inadequate for Pacific Islanders seeking safety and stability, as rising seas threaten to make their homelands uninhabitable. Amnesty has called on   – home to the world’s largest Pacific diaspora – to urgently reform its policies to provide “rights-based approach to climate-related displacement”. “This would include offering a dedicated humanitarian visa,” the report said. It also argued providing safe options for those most severely affected by climate change through humanitarian visas is “part of states’ obligations to ensure protection for people whose human rights are being threatened”. The report highlights how Tuvalu and  , where most land lies just 2 to 3 metres above sea level, face existential threats from rising seas, coastal erosion, and extreme weather. These impacts already undermine access to clean water, food, and safe housing. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), at least 50,000 Pacific Islanders each year face the risk of displacement from climate impacts such as sea level rise and extreme weather. More than half of the Pacific Islands’ population live within 500 metres of the coast, the WMO said, where sea levels are rising faster than the global average and driving pressures for climate-induced migration. There are some schemes for Pacific migration – namely to New Zealand and Australia – that provide pathways and could be used by those affected by the climate crisis. But experts say current pathways are inadequate and exclude some groups. “Pacific people are already on the move not as victims, but as skilled workers seeking stability and opportunity,” Tupai Fotu Jackson, a Pacific climate and labour mobility expert from New Zealand, said. “We need a humanitarian visa pathway that recognises climate displacement not as a crisis of desperation, but as a reality that demands planning, dignity, and partnership.” Dr Satyendra Prasad, the former Fiji ambassador to the UN and senior fellow in climate and sustainability at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said New Zealand should create a “pathway to full residency for Pacific Islanders” working under labour migration schemes. Prasad said he hoped the report would “ignite energy and action within New Zealand to create a visa category for Pacific Islanders facing displacement as a consequence of climate change”. Any migration pathway should complement, not replace, urgent climate action and support for in-place adaptation, the report said. About 320,000 people in the Pacific were displaced by disasters between 2008 and 2017, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Nasa projects sea levels could rise by up to 15cm  “Experiencing and seeing what is happening in the islands, if there was some sort of ‘refugee visas’ for us, I would definitely go for that visa,” said Tealofi, a 47-year-old Tuvaluan man quoted in the report. “You experience and see the bad impacts we see from climate change, especially in those days when you see the impacts of king tides and all the damages it provokes, why would I not want to apply for international protection?” he said. New Zealand’s immigration minister, Erica Stanford, would not comment on whether New Zealand would consider establishing a humanitarian visa because she had not yet seen Amnesty’s report. Nearly 9% of New Zealand’s population identify with a Pacific background, the report said. Most are Samoan, followed by Tongan and Cook Islands Māori. In 2017, the then New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, proposed a humanitarian visa for 100 Pacific Islanders annually displaced by climate breakdown. The plan never eventuated, leaving advocates frustrated by the lack of progress. New Zealand’s Pacific Access Category, which uses a lottery system and strict health requirements, excludes older people, those with disabilities, and others most vulnerable to climate impacts. Between 2010 and 2024, at least 26 applications were declined due to health-related requirements, forcing families to leave behind members with disabilities. Tuvalu’s  , the Falepili Union treaty, offers a rare example of a legally binding framework addressing statehood and mobility in the face of rising seas. Tuvalu’s prime minister, Feleti Teo,   “Australia is now the first country to legally recognise the continuity of our statehood despite climate change and sea level rise”. He said while these principles have gained traction through Pacific and UN declarations, “the ultimate objective is to develop a treaty under international law that enshrines these principles.”", "tags": ["pacific", "islands", "tuvalu", "kiribati", "asia", "pacific", "climate", "crisis", "new", "zealand", "news"]},

Inland areas have neared 40C (104F), with Xiushui, in Jiangxi province, recording 38.9C on Wednesday, about 13C above average for early October. Overnight warmth has also persisted. In Hong Kong, further heat on Wednesday brought October’s tally of “very hot days” – defined by temperatures remaining above 28C throughout the day – to four, the highest ever recorded for the month. Models suggest the unusual heat across south-east China will last for another eight to 10 days, before colder air pushes in from the north. In northern China, a much colder air mass clashed with the warmth to produce stubborn, heavy rain. There had been at least 36 hours of continuous rainfall in Beijing as of Thursday afternoon, averaging 68.8mm (2.71in) across the city, with one Daxing district station recording 140.4mm since Wednesday. The persistent rain kept temperatures unusually low; Thursday was Beijing’s coldest early October day since 1951, with a maximum of just 10.6C – about 10-15C below average. China has experienced numerous extreme rainfall events this year, an increase that can be linked to a warming global climate.

The first quake of magnitude 7.4, in waters off the town of Manay in the province of Davao Oriental, triggered a tsunami alert for coasts within 186 miles (300km) of the epicentre, but the warnings for the Philippines and Indonesia were subsequently lifted. A second earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the same area seven hours later, triggering another tsunami warning, with the country’s seismology agency, Phivolcs, warning of possible waves that could be more than 1 metre (3.2ft) higher than normal tides. People living near coastal areas in the southern Philippines were “strongly advised to immediately evacuate” to higher ground, or move further inland, Phivolcs said. The director of the agency, Teresito Bacolcol, described the twin earthquakes as a doublet – two distinct earthquakes that occurred along a massive trench off the country’s eastern seaboard. There were initial reports of damage to homes, buildings and bridges, one official in Manay said, although the full extent of the damage in the Philippines was not immediately clear. At least seven people were killed, a civil defence official, Ednar Dayanghirang, said in a briefing. The deaths were reported in towns and cities near the earthquake’s epicentre. Footage shared on social media after the first quake showed students fleeing in panic from their classrooms, radio anchors leaving their seats mid-air and people crouching and bracing themselves on all fours as the ground shook violently. Motorcycles were knocked over by the force of the tremor. The governor of Davao Oriental said people panicked when the first earthquake struck. “Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told the broadcaster DZMM. “It was very strong.” Evacuation orders were issued in affected areas, with schools suspending classes for the day. Damage to infrastructure, including cracks in the structure of the Magsaysay Bridge in Butuan city, were reported. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the Philippine president, said authorities were assessing the extent of the damage and search and rescue efforts being prepared. “We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” Marcos said. The energy secretary, Sharon Garin, said officials were monitoring four electric companies in Mindanao after power supply in some areas tripped. It was not immediately clear whether the shutdowns were caused by the earthquake or were a precautionary measure. Christine Sierte, a teacher in the town of Compostela, near Manay, told Agence France-Presse she was in an online meeting when the violent shaking started. “It was very slow at first then it got stronger … That’s the longest time of my life. We weren’t able to walk out of the building immediately because the shaking was so strong,” she said. “The ceilings of some offices fell, but luckily no one was injured.” She said some of the school’s 1,000 students “suffered panic attacks and difficulty in breathing”. Kath Cortez, a journalist based in Davao city, said the ground floor walls of her family’s house were showing small cracks. “I was surprised by the strength,” she said, adding members of her family ran out of the house. The quakes hit just 10 days after a deadly 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit Bogo City in Cebu province, which killed 71 people. Aftershocks are still being felt in the area. Neighbouring Indonesia also issued an earlier tsunami warning for its regions of North Sulawesi and Papua, according to its geophysics agency.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/nepal-gen-z-protests-one-month-on-slow-change", "content": "rakash Bohora was one of the first of Nepal’s gen Z protesters to feel the sting of a police bullet. Like thousands of other young people, he had taken to the streets of the capital last month to   and a draconian ban on social media. He had no idea that day in Kathmandu would escalate into what is now described as Nepal’s gen Z revolution, which saw the   within a day, the dissolution of parliament and appointment of a new interim prime minister, the anti-corruption hardliner Sushila Karki, by the end of the week. Bohora was outside the parliament building in Kathmandu on the morning of 8 September when he heard the sound of gunfire and felt pain in his left leg. As his friend carried him to the nearby hospital, his bloodied trainer was left behind amid the pandemonium. A photograph of the shoe later went viral, an evocative symbol of the deadliest day of protest in Nepal’s history, with 19 protesters killed. One month on, Bohora is still in hospital as doctors fight to save his leg. Sitting in the trauma ward, he expressed frustration at the what he saw as the slow pace of change for Nepal since the gen Z uprising, for which he paid such a heavy price. He was among those calling for the former prime minister KP Sharma Oli and the former home minister Ramesh Lekhak to be arrested for alleged corruption and their role in the shooting of protesters by police on 8 September. “It’s been a month since the movement began, yet many of our demands remain unmet,” Bohora said. Bohora had had been driven to protest in anger at a system that seemed to be making the politicians and their children wildly rich while he had faced unemployment and exploitation. Despite qualifying as a health assistant eight years ago, there was no work for Bohora in Nepal’s struggling job market and he eventually travelled to Russia for further studies. But after running out of money, he found himself  , fighting on the frontlines in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk. He saw friends killed and maimed. He finally escaped back to Nepal 18 months later. “I was lucky to return home alive,” Bohora said. “After coming back, I took to the streets hoping for a better country, free from corruption.” Many of the young people who took to the streets on 8 September say they simply wanted to raise their voice against corruption and never intended to bring about wholesale regime change – let alone be tasked with deciding the next prime minister and future of the country. Their movement had  , no manifesto and no singular set of demands, and still largely remains that way. Even the decision to champion Karki, a former chief justice, as their choice of interim prime minister came after she emerged as a favourite in online discussions and polls held by thousands of gen Z protesters on the social media platform Discord. With elections promised for March, Karki is under mounting pressure from gen Z groups to demonstrate that she will crack down on corruption as promised. Yet major bureaucratic obstacles remain in implementing large-scale reform, and the lack of any high-profile arrests of former ministers from Oli’s government is a growing bone of contention. “Right now, our main demand is to control corruption,” said Amit Khanal, 24, of the Gen-Z Movement Alliance. While there are no gen Z figures appointed to Karki’s cabinet yet, Khanal said they remained in close talks with the government. “This government was formed under special circumstances, and it must investigate the major corruption scandals, especially those involving former top leaders,” he said. “If no investigation is carried out, the entire purpose of this massive movement will be meaningless.” Om Prakash Aryal, whom Karki appointed as home minister, said one of the interim government’s first moves had been to “remove the obstructions and disconnect the political links” that had prevented the most powerful political figures from being investigated for corruption. “The environment is being created so the commission can accept complaints about anyone and investigate,” Aryal said. He emphasised that it would take time for authorities to carry out a full independent investigation into the decades of alleged graft, but added: “At the same time, there are things that must be acted on immediately. The government will not let impunity have room.” In the backdrop are growing efforts by Nepal’s biggest political parties – Nepali Congress, the Communists and the Maoists – to question the legitimacy of Karki’s interim government. After parliament was dissolved, all three parties released statements calling the move unconstitutional and dangerous. In a notable break from tradition, none attended Karki’s swearing-in ceremony. In an inflammatory speech this week, Oli accused Karki and the gen Z protesters of ulterior motives. “There is an attack on this country,” he said. “There is an attack on the sovereign power of this country. There is an attack on its territory. There is an attack on the country’s interests.” Analysts warned that the gulf between the interim government and the political parties could spell bad news for Nepal’s political stability and the success of its elections in March. Lok Raj Baral, a professor of political science and former ambassador to India, said that rather than casting blame, the gen Z uprising should be a moment of reckoning for Nepal’s political old guard. “This is an opportunity for old parties to correct themselves, to transfer leadership, to renew and regain their credibility,” he said. “The old leaders were busy fighting for their chairs. They should have now learned their lesson.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

No, there’s no punchline – it’s not that kind of anecdote. “My life has changed for ever,” Yousafzai says sadly, as we gaze at the semi-derelict structure. “Everything changed for ever, after that [night].” The shed is tucked away at the back of Lady Margaret Hall, away from the prying eyes of Oxford’s college life. You have to know how to find it. Yousafzai leads me through quadrangles and out into a hidden garden. Inside are dusty pint glasses and spiderwebs, and board games with the pieces missing. We are meeting on a bright summer afternoon, ahead of the release of her memoir, Finding My Way, a sequel to her 2013 bestseller I Am Malala. Dressed in a blue shirt, jeans and a headscarf, Yousafzai is accompanied, at a discreet distance, by two close-protection officers. The college is quiet – it’s the summer holidays – and Yousafzai attracts no attention from the few students who remain as she tramps across the grass. This is not our first interview. Our last conversation sparked days of negative headlines for Yousafzai, back home in her native  . As we gaze at the bong-shed, I fear that round two may lead to more of the same. In 2021, I profiled a then-23-year-old Yousafzai for the cover of British Vogue. The world’s youngest Nobel laureate – she received the award at 17, for her activism for girls’ education – had recently graduated from university and was about to launch her adult life. Yousafzai began campaigning at the age of 11. Her father, Ziauddin, is an education activist and she followed in his footsteps, writing a blog for BBC Urdu about her life as the   shut down girls’ schools across Pakistan’s Swat valley where she lived. When a Taliban gunman shot her in the head on her school bus when she was just 15 years old, Yousafzai was airlifted to the UK and made a remarkable recovery, resettling with her family in Birmingham, where she attended secondary school, all the while campaigning for the rights of girls around the world to receive an education. When I met Yousafzai in April 2021, she had just got a 2.1 from Oxford in politics, philosophy and economics, and signed a deal with Apple TV+ to develop and produce her own slate of TV and films. (The deal has now ended.) We did an interview at a hotel in London before walking  . When I asked her if she had a romantic partner, she blanched. “I would say that I have come across people who have been great, and I hope that I do find someone,” she stuttered, visibly embarrassed. Later, she mused on marriage. “I still don’t understand why people have to get married,” she told me. “If you want to have a person in your life, why do you have to sign marriage papers, why can’t it just be a partnership?” Her comments seemed unexceptional. I was more concerned that the fact she’d told me that she frequented pubs could create controversy, given that Yousafzai is Muslim, and so when I wrote up the interview I was careful to specify that she did not drink alcohol. The article came out. Yousafzai shared it, and sent me a message of thanks. The following day, logging on to Twitter (now X), I saw that #shameonMalala was trending in Pakistan. Her comments had been widely misinterpreted to mean that she was denouncing  , the Islamic institution of marriage, and implicitly to suggest that she condoned premarital sex. She led Pakistan’s national news  . Online commentators accused Yousafzai of betraying her religion as a result of western indoctrination. An influential cleric tagged her father on Twitter, asking him to explain his daughter’s un-Islamic remarks. (He responded, saying they had been taken out of context.) Parliamentarians in an   even debated her comments. Yousafzai maintained a dignified silence. And then, in November 2021, she   surprise wedding to Pakistani cricket manager Asser Malik. Many, including myself, struggled to make sense of it. Malala,  ?!” I ask now as she walks, alone, into an empty conference room and greets me with a hug. She smiles sheepishly. “When you asked that question [about meeting someone],” she says, “I felt like I was caught. It was like, wait a second, does she know anything? I was like, no, no, no, you know, I just don’t want to get married.” In Finding My Way, Yousafzai reveals that, by the time of the Vogue interview, she and Malik were already dating. In other words, Yousafzai over-corrected to throw me off the scent. But she was sincere in having her doubts about marriage. Growing up in Pakistan, she says, it represented “a future without any opportunity, where your husband determines your life”. After the furore, her parents, but particularly her mother, were distraught. “She was so mad at me,” Yousafzai says. Family and friends kept texting articles. An imam from her village called to lecture her parents on the phone. “I was facing a lot of pressure,” she says, “from my dad, especially, and my mum, to issue a statement to clarify what my thoughts were on marriage, and I found this absurd.” And then there was Malik. Yousafzai’s parents had met him, but she hadn’t felt ready to make the relationship public. She felt guilty for disavowing him publicly, but Malik didn’t blame her, and instead stepped in to help mediate with her parents. Over the following months, Yousafzai began to interrogate her views on marriage. She asked Malik about his thoughts on women and equality, and liked what she heard. “I’m supposed to be an advocate for girls and women, and even I was limiting my own self in how I perceived marriage,” Yousafzai says. But there were other pressures, familiar to any immigrant child who has butted up against their parents’ cultural expectations. When Malik and Yousafzai left the house together, her mother would urge them to “maintain, like, a 10-foot distance”, she says. It seems from reading Finding My Way that she would not have married so young were it not for her parents. She nods. “I felt like I was sort of giving up,” she says. Refusing to marry would have led to not only interfamilial, but international, conflict. “Am I willing to fight my mum and my dad? Am I willing to start a new debate on people living together without these ceremonies and traditions?” Yousafzai realised that she couldn’t live with Malik “without getting married in the traditional way, in the religious way”. She could dig her heels in, but it would cause immense pain to her parents. And, besides, she was in love. “He’s so charming, he’s so smart, and I just could not stop thinking about him.” So she relented. On 9 November 2021, at her parents’ house in Birmingham, in an Islamic ceremony, Yousafzai married. fter marriage, Yousafzai realised that “things feel sort of the same. They’re not that different.” She lives with Malik in a riverside apartment in London. They split the chores; neither cooks, instead eating out or using a meal delivery service. (Yousafzai’s mother thinks this is “a disaster. She says, ‘Your house is the only house where there’s a fridge with no vegetables!’”) It has been only four years since we met, but Yousafzai is much changed. The woman I met before appeared girlish, even a little gauche. She was visibly mortified when we spoke about relationships. Now, she is grounded and at ease. She also looks subtly different, having undergone surgery to improve the facial paralysis she suffered after the attack. At university, Yousafzai experienced the sweetness of independent adult life for the first time. When we met in 2021, she described a whirl of college balls, societies and essay crises. Now she’s more willing to share the unvarnished reality of her university experience. In Finding My Way, Yousafzai writes of the pressures of having to travel internationally, maintaining the relationships critical to the  , which supports girls’ education projects around the world, in addition to paid speaking gigs. She is the breadwinner not only for her parents and two brothers, but also for her extended family back home in Pakistan, and even family friends. (At one point, she was paying for two family friends to attend college, in the US and Canada.) Did she feel resentful of these financial obligations? “It was difficult to manage,” Yousafzai says. She “hated the experience of thinking about our expenses for the next year and [thinking], OK, I have to do this event, because otherwise we won’t be able to cover these costs ” Her studies suffered. Yousafzai got a 2.2 in her first-year exams and had to seek additional support from specialist tutors, a humbling experience for the most famous education activist in the world. “I felt like an impostor,” she laughs. “I felt ashamed.” She asked her tutor to write a letter to her parents explaining that she was forbidden from working during term time because she was failing her degree. Why didn’t she tell her parents herself? “I had talked to my family many times about the pressure,” she says, “and how difficult it was to manage.” She writes of how, at home in Birmingham, “my dad treated our house like an art museum, and me like the signature piece in the collection”. She would be summoned downstairs to meet visitors keen to gawp at a Nobel laureate up close. “My dad is a very generous person,” she says, “a giving person, and he always understood what other people wanted … in his heart, he knew that they wanted to meet me.” Have there been times, I ask, where he’s pushed you too much? “Oh,” she laughs, “he has  pushed me.” When meeting well-wishers or guests at family events, Ziauddin has given her the odd shove. “You know when you have a little kid, and you sort of push the kid [to] say hello to this person? I’m, like, it’s fine when they’re little kids, you know.” But even when she’s grouching, it’s clear Yousafzai has tremendous love and respect for the man who, however inadvertently, propelled her on to the world stage. “My dad has always been supportive,” she says. “Whenever I explain something to him, he completely understands it. He is one of those cool dads, who never disagrees with me.” But I fear even the world’s most down-to-earth father may have concerns about what Yousafzai – whose new book is likely to be a bestseller (her first memoir sold nearly 2m copies) – is about to put in the public domain. nd so to the bong incident. What happened that night: Yousafzai tried to walk back to her room, but she blacked out en route. A girlfriend carried her back instead. She couldn’t sleep. Her brain endlessly replayed a loop of the day the Taliban attempted to murder her. The gun. The bloodspray. Her body being carried through crowds to an ambulance. She had always thought she couldn’t remember being shot. But the bong unlocked long-submerged memories, of the attack and also of a childhood growing up under the spectre of Taliban violence. “I had never felt so close to the attack as then, in that moment,” she tells me. “I felt like I was reliving all of it, and there was a time when I just thought I was in the afterlife.” She felt she was dying, or already dead. “It’s easier to laugh about it now,” she says, with a small, tight smile. Listening to her speak, I feel deep compassion for all she went through as a young child. “I was nine or 10 when the Taliban took over control in our valley,” she says, “and they would bomb schools, they would kill or slaughter people and hang their bodies upside down.” After the bong, Yousafzai developed anxiety. “I felt numb … I couldn’t recognise myself in the mirror,” she says. The sweetness of college life fell away. She told her parents in general terms about the incident, but “they were a bit dismissive”, she says. She struggled to tell them how much it had affected her mental health. “I just could not explain to them that things are not the same any more.” Friends were worried about her. (Maria, her personal assistant, who lives in London, was so concerned she drove up to be with her immediately after the incident.) Yousafzai lied and told them things were fine. “I’m the girl who was shot … I’m supposed to be a brave girl,” she says. Until she couldn’t pretend any longer. “I’d be sweating and shaking and I could hear my heart beat. Then I started getting panic attacks.” She saw a therapist, and realised that her childhood, the attempted murder and exam stress were overwhelming her mental health. In the book, Yousafzai writes a list of her symptoms at the time: a racing heart, finding it hard to breathe, struggles sleeping, brain fog and a constant fear of someone she loved dying. “Normal people don’t have lists like this,” she writes, adding, “Something is wrong with me.” “I survived an attack,” she says, “and nothing happened to me, and I laughed it off. I thought nothing could scare me, nothing. My heart was so strong. And then I was scared of small things, and that just broke me. But, you know, in this journey I realised what it means to be actually brave.

She talks about how young she was when she started winning awards, and what it was like to go to ceremonies and see activists there who had spent decades fighting for a cause. It made her feel as if she needed to “spend the rest of my life campaigning for girls’ education” to show she was worthy. But no matter how many leaders she lobbied, or projects she helped to fund – Yousafzai glows when she talks about the girls’ school she opened back home – she felt it was not enough. There was “always this feeling … could I do more?” Her youthful idealism began to flake and peel off in patches, and then rub clean away. “As I was getting older,” she says, “I was realising that things are not as straightforward. Things are more complex.” As a teen, Yousafzai had seen the world as a biddable place. She would reason with world leaders! Show them girls’ education was important! As she got older, she began to see the world as it really is. You became cynical? I ask. “Yeah,” she says, “for sure.” She gives a bitter, clipped laugh. “100%.” n April 2021, the US announced it was withdrawing from   in August of that year. Within days of them leaving, the Taliban took over the country. “We had calls with the Afghan activists who the Malala Fund were supporting,” she says, “and it was just unbelievable. Some of them knew the worst was coming. Some of them still had faith.” Afghanistan is now the only country in the world where girls cannot go to secondary school or higher education, with   being madrasas that promote an extreme interpretation of Islam. The Malala Fund continues to do what it can. “We are providing funding for alternative education right now,” she says. “There are underground schools, there are radio and television education programmes.” Yousafzai is heartbroken at what has come to pass. “I feel the world has forgotten about the women in Afghanistan,” she says. What stings is that “people were willing to trust the Taliban more than Afghan women”. Which people, I ask? “World leaders,” she says, “decision makers.” Yousafzai writes of emailing politicians, begging for their assistance in evacuating her Afghan partners to safety before the Taliban took over. “For years, I’d smiled in pictures with these leaders, shaken their hands and stood next to them at podiums – but not one of them picked up the phone, or replied to my messages. To the men who ran the world, I was just a photo op.” Who didn’t take her calls? She mentions Biden. Johnson. Macron. Trudeau. She notes, pointedly, that female politicians did. Erna Solberg, the then Norwegian prime minister, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Lolwah Al-Khater, assistant foreign minister of Qatar at the time, stepped in to help evacuate her Afghan partners to safe countries, in some instances without passports. For many years, Yousafzai pioneered a model of professional activism: cautious, consensus-driven, willing to work with institutions, rather than calling them out; one that used the photo op and the handshake, rather than the megaphone and the protest. Her detractors said she was too corporate, but Yousafzai sincerely believed it was better to work with people and make incremental change. And then Afghanistan happened. Did she feel duped? “I do feel like I’m more cynical,” she says. “But, at the same time, I do my work. I know that optimism is the only way you can keep going, because there’s no other option.” There is a perception on social media that, as one of the most prominent Muslim activists in the world today, Yousafzai has not done enough to  . This perception is not entirely fair. Through the Malala Fund, and personally, Yousafzai has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to organisations that support children and schools in Gaza. She first called for a ceasefire on 10 October 2023. Today, it is Yousafzai who brings up Gaza. “Israel has to stop this indiscriminate bombing,” she says. Humanitarian aid must be allowed in, she adds, characterising the starvation of civilians as “deliberate”. But, still, the perception lingers. Her critics, she says, “completely are dismissing or ignoring the actual work that I’m doing”. Yousafzai describes what is happening in Gaza as “a genocide”. “You look at the evidence, you look at what’s happening, you look at how they’re [the IDF] committing these actions, and it’s very clear if they’re targeting people for collecting aid, or getting water. Everyone knows children are unarmed.” She also calls for the release of the surviving hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza in appalling conditions. “I’ve been very consistent in saying that the hostages should be freed … I don’t believe in using violence for resistance.” Does she think she has done enough? “I wish I lived in a world where I could do a tweet and the world would stop the war.” After we meet, Yousafzai travels to Egypt to meet injured Palestinian child refugees, and announces a   to support their medical treatment and education. “There isn’t a night where I don’t think about what I can do,” she says. hroughout the 2010s, Yousafzai was the most prominent of a wave of child activists – such as the climate-change campaigners Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate, or gun-control advocate Emma González (now X González) – feted by world leaders, invited to events, on the covers of magazines, writing bestselling memoirs, delivering speeches to adoring audiences. This cultural moment has now passed. The celebrity activist feels like a relic of a different era. Many question what these activists achieved. The Malala Fund supports girls’ education projects in six countries. In order to maintain the funding streams, Yousafzai has to cultivate relationships with funders and world leaders, inevitably leading to accusations of selling out. Most of the people who slam her online will never achieve a fraction of what she has done for girls around the world. But it can at times be jarring to see Yousafzai enjoying an international jet-set lifestyle – days out at Formula One and at   – interspersed with posts about Gaza or the plight of Afghan girls. She is often compared unfavourably by her critics, particularly those on the left, with Thunberg, who is willing to put herself in physical danger, boarding the Freedom Flotilla and setting sail for Gaza. “I really look up to Greta,” says Yousafzai, adding she checked in with her after she was detained by Israeli authorities. In April 2024, Yousafzai attended the opening night of Suffs, a Broadway musical about the suffragettes that she executive produced. Also in attendance was Hillary Clinton, a fellow executive producer. Online commentators flamed Yousafzai for being associated with the hawkish former secretary of state. In reality, Yousafzai says, she didn’t realise that Clinton was an executive producer on the project until after she had been brought on, and they did not work together on it. “People say, ‘Oh, you’re at the Suffs premiere, you are an executive producer, oh, Hillary Clinton has these views, therefore you support these views, therefore you are also complicit.” Being photographed at the same star-studded premiere as Clinton, rightly or wrongly, reinforces a persistent criticism of Yousafzai in Pakistan: that she is in the pocket of western powers; there are even longstanding rumours that she is an intelligence asset. When I ask her about this, she pushes back. “Pakistan is a part of me,” she says, “and so I get defensive when I’m asked this question. I say, no, no, no, Pakistan doesn’t hate me.” She fears that by giving succour to the view that she is unpopular in Pakistan, she feeds into broader anti-Muslim sentiment: the idea that Pakistan is a country full of backwards people who instinctively hate educated women. “I believe,” she says, “and it is deliberate, on my side, that I have a lot more love and support in Pakistan.” But, equally, she says, “I’m not going to deny there isn’t any hint [of hatred] at all. There is. There have been these campaigns from when I was, like, 12 years old. “The criticism is not against me,” she adds. “It’s more criticism against the west, criticism against these bigger narratives, and political conversations, but I am sort of attached to it.” Still, it’s clear to see it wears on her. “I do find it sad,” she admits, “that I sometimes have to read everything 10 times before I post it, because I’m, like, what is it that will get people’s attention? It is difficult. I do wish for more freedom in expressing myself.” After I wrap up the section of the interview on politics, Yousafzai exhales with relief and stretches her arms out in front of her, as if we are colleagues who have just finished a difficult task and can now relax with a cup of tea and a biscuit. By contrast, when it comes to talking about her family and her relationship with Malik, she speaks freely, laughing often. She is happiest when talking about her plans for  , an investment fund with a focus on women’s sports that she recently launched with Malik. Recess isn’t a non-profit, as I initially assumed. It’s a business, with the aim of increasing participation in women’s sports. Malik helped Yousafzai find her love of exercise. The fact that Malik is a cricket manager was part of his initial appeal, says the cricket-mad Yousafzai, even if her husband refuses to let her watch him play. “He says,” Yousafzai says, with an eye roll, “‘I used to work in cricket  ! I was not a professional cricketer!’ I’m, like, uh-huh. He did not explain that before marriage.” She hopes that Recess will “create more opportunities for women in sports” and help women “get a say in sports at all levels, whether that’s from the field to the owner’s box”. Before we leave, I ask Yousafzai if her parents have read Finding My Way. She says she has given them the gist of it, but they have not read it. “I have told them, ‘You will read it when it’s released, and you can pick it up from any bookshelf in any bookstore, and feel free to read it, but then you cannot make any changes.’” I understand the logic, familiar to many first- and second-generation immigrant children, including myself. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. But I’m also floored. Because Yousafzai is a global figure: the bong story will, inevitably, unleash a maelstrom of negative publicity back home. She is ready. “I am very prepared for that,” Yousafzai says, absolutely calm. “I don’t think I’m going to get defensive about it at all. I’m not going to issue any statement. If anybody has any confusion, they can read my book and decide for themselves.” It strikes me as I walk away from our interview that she never chose any of this. To be shot as a child, to be airlifted to the UK, to win the Nobel peace prize. Yousafzai seems to be someone who consistently puts others before herself, whether it’s accommodating her parents’ cultural expectations around marriage, supporting her family back home, or dedicating her life to advancing girls’ education. “I’m working so hard to learn how to say no,” she says, “and to be more direct … I do sort of overthink about other people’s feelings sometimes.” If the story of her teens and early 20s was of service to others, her late 20s are about Yousafzai choosing happiness for herself. I think she deserves it.  Finding My Way by Malala Yousafzai is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson on 21 October at £25.

China’s commerce ministry announced the restrictions on Thursday, arguing damage had been caused to its “national security” from exports of the technologies – both directly or indirectly – to foreign military. The restrictions require government permission for the export of technology used to mine, process or recycle rare-earth minerals or make magnets from it, which could have dual use. The ministry noted that permission may not be granted. The new rules come amid tense US-China trade talks, and weeks before an expected meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.  and rare-earth magnets are used in products ranging from consumer electronics and cars to jet engines and radar systems. China controls   and almost all of its separation and processing and magnet manufacturing. The restrictions also ban Chinese nationals and Chinese companies from assisting in the same processes overseas. Foreign manufacturers using Chinese machinery or components overseas are now expected to seek permission, although it was unclear how that would be enforced. Companies hoping to export items that have even small traces of Chinese-sourced rare-earths elements must get ministry approval. Those with previously issued export licences for potential dual-use items were encouraged to “proactively present” the licences for inspection. Most of the new rules, which took immediate effect on Thursday and expand on export restrictions first announced in April, make clear that Beijing is targeting particular industries. The announcement specified that overseas defence users would not be granted licences, the ministry said, while applications related to advanced semiconductors would only be approved on a case-by-case basis. The ministry said that “for some time” unnamed persons and organisations had transferred rare earths and related technologies from China to overseas parties for use “directly or indirectly in military and other sensitive fields”. “This has caused significant damage or potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and undermined international non-proliferation efforts,” it said.

Deals between the EU, the US and China eased the shortages, with new licences granted in recent months, but it did not completely address the issues and rare earths remain a key element of the trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington.

China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, over the strong objections of the government in Taipei, and has increased its military and political pressure on the island. The public security bureau in the Chinese city of Xiamen, which sits opposite Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, said the 18 were core members of the Taiwan military’s “psychological warfare unit” and published their pictures, names and Taiwan identity card numbers. The unit handled tasks such as disinformation, intelligence gathering, psychological warfare and the broadcast of propaganda, the Xiamen security bureau claimed. “For a long time they plotted to incite separatist activities,” the bureau said, adding there would be rewards of up to 10,000 yuan (US$1,402) for tips leading to their arrest. In a separate report, the state-controlled Chinese news agency Xinhua said they launched websites for smear campaigns, created seditious games to incite secession, produced fake video content to mislead people, operated illegal radios for “infiltration”, and manipulated public opinion with resources from “external forces”. Taiwan’s defence ministry said the accusations reflected the “despotic and pig-headed thinking of an authoritarian regime … trying to divide our people, belittle our government, and conduct cognitive warfare.” China had repeatedly issued such reports that “exploit the free flow of information in our democratic society to piece together and fabricate personal data”, the Taiwanese ministry said. “Defending national security and protecting the safety and wellbeing of the people is the unshirkable duty of every military officer and soldier,” it said. The wanted notice is largely symbolic given that Taiwanese intelligence officers do not openly visit China, which also has no legal jurisdiction on the island. On Friday, the Taiwanese president, Lai Ching-te, pledged greater efforts to boost Taiwan’s defences, calling on China to renounce the use of force to seize the island. China reacted with anger, calling Lai a troublemaker and a “war-maker”. In June, China issued a similar bounty for the arrest of 20 people Beijing said were Taiwanese military hackers.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/heavy-clashes-erupt-along-pakistan-afghanistan-border", "content": "Intense clashes erupted along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on Saturday night after an attack by the Taliban on Pakistani military posts. This escalation comes after a Pakistani airstrike in Kabul this week, as reported by security officials from both nations. Taliban forces launched armed reprisals against Pakistani troops, alleging that Islamabad had conducted airstrikes on Afghan territory, according to senior   officials from various provinces. They claimed to have seized two Pakistani border posts in the southern province of Helmand, which was confirmed by local authorities. Pakistani security officials acknowledged clashes at several border locations, stating they were responding forcefully. “Tonight, Taliban forces began firing at several border points. We retaliated with artillery at four locations along the border,” a Pakistani government official told the Guardian. “We will not tolerate any aggression from the Afghan Taliban within our territory. Pakistani forces responded with heavy fire, effectively targeting several Afghan border posts,” the official added. The Pakistan army used artillery, tanks and both light and heavy weaponry in their counterattacks. On Thursday, two explosions were reported in the Afghan capital and another in southeastern Afghanistan. The Taliban-run defence ministry subsequently accused Pakistan of “violating its sovereignty” in connection with the attacks. Analysts said recent days showed just how deep the border tensions run. Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst based in Washington DC, said: “Intensifying cross-border attacks on Pakistani forces, unusually intense Pakistani strikes in Afghanistan, and Taliban retaliations have created a perfect storm for trouble. If you throw in the fact that Afghanistan doesn’t recognise the border, as well as the proliferation of disinformation about the crisis, it all makes for a precarious situation.” Islamabad has expressed growing impatience with Kabul, refraining from confirming or denying involvement in the airstrikes. While Islamabad has not explicitly claimed responsibility for the attacks, it has called on Kabul to cease harbouring the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which is accused of killing hundreds of Pakistani soldiers since 2021 and is believed to have received combat training in Afghanistan, sharing ideological ties with the Afghan Taliban. “Fortunately this crisis, serious as it is, is poised to de-escalate sooner rather than later. The Taliban lack the capacity to fight the Pakistani military head-on, and once the retaliations appease public anger, they’re likely to recede,” said Kugelman. Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military spokesperson, acknowledged reports of the strikes, and said: “To protect the lives of the people of Pakistan, we are doing, and will continue to do, whatever is necessary.” He urged Afghanistan to prevent its territory from being used for terrorism against Pakistan. Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst based in Islamabad, said: “I think what we have seen in these few hours is a logical conclusion of the tensions that had been brewing up between the two countries, particularly after the kinetic attacks on TTP hideouts and the continuous refusal of the Afghan regime to take demonstrable conclusive action against the TTP, which is spearheading the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.” Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have been strained in recent months due to Islamabad’s accusations that Kabul is harbouring TTP, which carried out attacks on Pakistan. Kugelman believes for Pakistan “the risk is that its recent strikes in Afghanistan will galvanise TTP to carry out reprisals, which could invite further and perhaps more intense Pakistani operations in Afghanistan.” He said: “And then the cycle could play out again. There are no winners or easy long-term solutions here. “If we see de-escalation now, we’re nowhere near being out of the woods.” The two countries share a nearly 2,600km (1,600 miles) rugged and mountainous border known as the Durand Line. Gul said: “I think Pakistan’s patience had been wearing thin. And that’s why they basically decided to take direct action themselves against TTP leaders. And now, obviously, the Taliban would say that it was a retaliatory attack, retaliatory action.”", "tags": ["afghanistan", "pakistan", "south", "and", "central", "asia", "taliban", "news"]},

As technology marches ever onward, with advances in artificial intelligence, 8K video streaming and a growing list of smart devices around our homes, Australians are about to see their internet services rise to meet the challenge. It will put us up there with global net leaders such as Singapore and Hong Kong, paving the way for an exciting digital future. But as we look forward to superior speeds and brag-worthy bandwidth, it’s worth noting that there are still some questions to answer, such as who will have access to this next generation of internet? And which providers are best placed to take us there? With the help of James Di Trapani, a network engineer with the internet provider Aussie Broadband, let’s explore. From 14 September 2025, the National Broadband Network (NBN) is giving some internet plans a serious boost. Up to   on fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) connections will find plans such as the 100/20 (which provides up to 100Mbps download speeds and 20Mbps upload speeds) automatically upgraded to 500/50. The NBN’s 250/25 plan will be upgraded to 750/50, while users on the NBN’s gigabit plan, the 1000/50, will have their maximum upload doubled to 100Mbps. New Home Hyperfast plans will take things further, offering the first multi-gigabit download speeds for home internet in Australia, with speeds of up to 2000/200 for some users. These new speeds should meet the growing and changing demands of modern internet users. “Ten years ago, the average Australian household used around 40 gigabytes of data per month, with around seven internet-enabled devices,” Di Trapani says. “Today, the average Australian household uses around 443 gigabytes of data per month, and owns an average of 22 internet-connected devices. By the end of the decade, the average Australian household is expected to use more than one terabyte of data every month, with 44 connected devices.” As Australians are about to see, NBN service is just the first step; internet providers need to rise to the challenge, too. Not all internet providers are the same. Only some will be able to offer the benefits of the new NBN high-data capabilities, such as 8K video streaming, cloud gaming and high-definition video conferencing. This is because the NBN flows through physical cables from its 121 points of interconnect (POI) across the country, and each internet provider links its network to one or more of these POIs. Some, such as Aussie Broadband, will be better equipped to meet the challenges of the NBN’s next phase. “We maintain and operate our own network to provide the best possible performance, reliability and connectivity,” Di Trapani says. “By owning that network, we can control, manage and upgrade it as necessary. If another company is reliant on someone else’s network to provide connectivity, they are then reliant on their provider for upgrades, troubleshooting and maintenance, which they may or may not do.” Aussie Broadband’s network has also been created with redundancy in mind; it has built multiple paths of connection for internet traffic, so that even if one goes down, the internet keeps flowing. These pathways have also been created to improve capacity (or bandwidth), meaning Aussie Broadband speeds should stay consistent, even when demand grows. “These links are a little like lanes on a freeway – the more lanes you have, the more a network is capable of handling traffic without all the cars slowing down to a halt,” Di Trapani says. “Without enough capacity, users will run into slower speeds and congestion issues.” If you can currently get FTTP or HFC connections, you’ll be ready for the NBN upgrade. If not, you might be eligible for a free   to FTTP. You’ll also need to make sure you’re supported by an internet provider with a network capable of managing the new speeds. It’s important to find a service that offers not just download speeds, but bandwidth, which is how much data the service can move at one time. As we keep adding more internet-enabled devices to our homes, bandwidth will only become more important. “It helps having more and more connected devices to your wifi simultaneously without service degradation,” Di Trapani says. With the right service, the last piece of the puzzle is hardware – that is, the wifi router. Older routers might use wifi 4 (an early generation of wifi), but those won’t be able to reach the supersonic speeds of the new plans. Instead, wifi 7-enabled routers (Di Trapani recommends the eero 7 or eero Pro 7) will be the gold standard for speed, bandwidth and more. “These newer routers will also have greater range than older versions, as well as support for newer technologies like mesh networks, which can create a blanket of wifi coverage across your household, or the ability to automatically manage devices across wifi channels for better reliability and speeds,” Di Trapani says. With the right service provider and NBN-ready hardware, Australians should be ready to take advantage of world-class internet speeds, now and into the future.", "tags": ["aussie", "broadband:", "upgrade", "ordinary", "to", "awesome", "advertisement", "features"]},

To stay connected, start with mobile broadband with a 4G or 5G SIM – either a data-only or a mobile SIM. Would you like me to run you through that? Great question. Let’s say you have three mobile services with 40GB of allocated data per service. Each of the services draws from a combined pool of 120GB of data. With data pooling, if one service uses more than 40GB, it won’t be restricted or slowed. This can be handy for work, and is really great for families if someone chews through their data but still needs their speed. Don’t be embarrassed. You’d be surprised how common this question is. First off: what video platform are you using?  For this job, Microsoft Teams.  Easy as. To share your screen in Teams, you’ll first need to be in an actual meeting. From there, locate your toolbar – it’s normally at the bottom of the screen – then find the ‘Share content’ button. A menu should then ask what you want to share, such as your entire screen or a specific window. Click on the option that suits. If you see a minimised version of your screen in the Teams window, you’re in business. It’s a good idea to ask your colleagues if they can see your screen before you begin your presentation.

Research shows we’re increasingly looking for markers of good when we buy, whether they reflect commitments to sustainability, diversity or social justice. We don’t just want the best product or service; we want to know we’re choosing a business that reflects our values and considers its impact on the world. It’s not always easy to know which companies are doing the right thing. But fortunately, there’s one big green flag to look for: B Corporation (or ‘B Corp’) certification. Whether we’re shopping for new clothes, a bar of chocolate or an essential service such as internet access, B Corp certification is a sign that the business ticks some very important boxes. B Corp certification isn’t just some rubber stamp or social lip service; it’s the result of a real process that requires applicant businesses to prove they meet stringent criteria. “Certified B Corps are businesses that are verified by B Lab to meet high standards of environmental and social performance across five impact areas, agree to be transparent about this performance, and commit to accountability to all stakeholders,” says Cameron Foley, the community impact manager with internet service provider Aussie Broadband. Those   are governance (including the company’s mission, ethics and transparency); workers (a commitment to policies that benefit workers); community (including overall community impact, diversity and charitable giving); environment (including how the business approaches environmental management practices and its impact on air, climate, water, land and biodiversity); and customers (including product quality and the ethical treatment of customers). While a business can hold itself to these standards independently, B Corp certification offers clear goalposts, community transparency and authenticity, which Foley says is vital for today’s socially minded consumers. “Consumers that are drawn to purpose-driven companies view their purchases as an extension of their identity, and as a result they want to do business with companies that reflect their ethics, their views on sustainability, and social justice,” he says. “They want to know that the company they are supporting is authentic and not simply greenwashing.” One business living its values is Foley’s employer, Aussie Broadband. Over an 18-month process, it undertook an assessment that included more than 200 detailed questions about the business and its operations, and it is required to resubmit for certification every three years. It’s a complex, time-consuming process, but it’s one that Foley says is critical for Aussie Broadband in demonstrating its core values to its customers. “For many years now, one of our company values has always been ‘be good to people’,” Foley says. “But it doesn’t just mean being good to   people; we want to leave a positive impact on our customers, the communities in which we live and operate, and the world in which our customers live, too.” For Aussie Broadband, this has meant taking greater initiative to drive change as a newly crowned B Corp. Foley says the business has since accelerated its transition to 100% renewable energy on its owned and operated sites, and begun using the   platform to track the environmental credentials of its supply chain partners. Considering the potential for e-waste in the telco industry, Aussie Broadband has also partnered with   to recycle and repurpose devices such as laptops and modems. On the social side, Aussie Broadband has expanded its charity product discount program,  . The initiative, which now supports more than 1,100 partners, offers discounts and digital empowerment to charities, not-for-profits and Indigenous-owned businesses. As we head into an increasingly digital future, the businesses that facilitate the transition will only grow in importance. Choosing utilities such as the internet is no longer just about getting great service, world-class speeds and value for money. Foley says mindful consumers are looking hard for companies that reflect their core beliefs, such as greater care for the environment, society and employees. “There is a growing number of environmentally and socially conscious consumers who highly value purpose-driven businesses that take care of their people and the places in which they operate,” Foley says. “Consumers want companies to hold themselves to a high standard, and to be transparent and accountable about their impact on the environment and society.”", "tags": ["aussie", "broadband:", "upgrade", "ordinary", "to", "awesome", "advertisement", "features"]},

On Thursday, the   that criminalises attending a “prohibited” protest. It came as part of a judgment that banned a planned pro-Palestine march to the Sydney Opera House scheduled for the weekend. Before this, protesters, police, and even the courts had consistently considered that a court ruling prohibiting a protest did not mean the protest itself was unlawful. It merely exposed a person to potentially being charged if they committed certain actions under the Summary Offences Act.  \n For example, if the courts prohibited a protest at a certain location but people turned up anyway, they wouldn’t be charged unless they were obstructing traffic and ignored a move-on order or were causing harm.  \n But now a demonstrator’s mere presence at a banned protest could expose them to being found in contempt of court if they’re found to have knowledge of the court order, or potentially charged for knowingly joining an unlawful assembly. Advocates are now raising concerns it could undermine the “form 1” system, which was initially set up to encourage the right to protest. Under the regime introduced in NSW in 1979, protest organisers can apply to police ahead of time using a   – commonly known  . If police oppose the form 1, the supreme court has the final say over whether the protest will be “authorised” or “prohibited”. Sarah Schwartz, a legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said she fears the new ruling could deter people from using the system. “It really means that people are now going to have to make a choice,” she said. “I would say it’s kind of the opposite of having a system that facilitates peaceful protest because it means that there’s an incentive now for people not to make an application under this system.” As one organiser told Guardian Australia: “Why would I now risk turning a lawful right to assemble into an unlawful one?” Meanwhile, Stephen Blanks, a spokesperson for the NSW Civil Liberties Council, said he’s concerned that the contempt of court risk extends not just to the defendants, but to everyone. “It has never been contemplated in any case over the last 20 years that people who are not parties to these court proceedings could be subject to contempt of court,” he said. However, the police say they don’t expect it to lead to fewer form 1 applications. “I think, by and large, people want to work with the police, and they want to get the outcome they want. They don’t want the conflict, we don’t want the conflict and we want to make sure people are safe,” the assistant commissioner Peter McKenna told reporters shortly after the judgment was delivered. McKenna had told reporters last week after police knocked back the Palestine Action Group’s application to march to the Opera House that such decisions had only gone before the supreme court two or three times this year. One of the protest groups that went before the court last year after the police knocked back their form 1 on safety grounds was Rising Tide. The court sided with police,  . The police facilitated the protest, however confined it to an area so that it wouldn’t disrupt the coal ships. After some people went outside the boundary in an attempt to try to stop the ships, 173 people were arrested and 130 were charged for blocking a major facility. Of those not charged, 29 were fined under the Marine Safety Act for obstructing a vessel and 14 people aged under 18 were not charged. Rising Tide will host their next blockade of the Newcastle Port in just over a month. Zack Schofield, a spokesperson for the group, said they plan to submit a form 1 because they have been requested by the Newcastle city council to do so. “We use the form 1 system to engage in good faith,” he said. Schofield said it remained to be seen what the group would do this year if the court blocks them again. Sign up to  Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion But he said: “If I or any other Rising Tide organiser are arrested for contempt of court or disobeying a prohibition order, we will appeal that decision on behalf of all Australians to the high court, because we believe it is fundamentally unconstitutional.” Whether or not it could be found unconstitutional remains murky. Anne Twomey, a professor in constitutional law at the University of  , said the implied freedom of political communication is not absolute. “There is no breach of the implied freedom if the law is reasonably appropriate and adapted to achieve another legitimate end,” she said. In the case of the proposed Opera House march this weekend, for example, she said the court stressed the serious public safety concerns that would arise if the protest went ahead in that particular location. “Public safety is a legitimate end which the courts have previously accepted as a ground for permitting limitations on political protests, as long as the limitations are proportionate,” she said. Justice Stephen Free said when reading out the reasons to prohibit the Opera House march: “The court further held that the risk to public safety associated with this public assembly was so significant that it would be irresponsible to allow the public assembly to proceed irrespective of the political significance of the event and the importance of freedom of political expression.” There are divergent views about the value of the form 1 system. The NSW Council for Civil Liberties has been urging the Minns government to scrap it, and it doesn’t exist in Victoria. The premier of Victoria, Jacinta Allen, has consistently pushed back on calls for the state to follow NSW in adopting it. “In my mind that runs the risk of being a very lengthy, unwieldy, time-consuming process for both the police force and the court system and it does not give a guarantee that each and every event would be undertaken peacefully,” Allan has previously said. The NSW Greens spokesperson for justice, Sue Higginson, said the system was useful, but only if used in the way it was intended when it was first introduced: to facilitate genuine protests – particularly as protests escalate to reflect the scale of the issues they are trying to tackle, such as genocide and climate collapse. Higginson argued this was reflected in justice Belinda Rigg’s authorisation of the Palestine Action Group’s march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which attracted  . In her judgment, Rigg said: “The march at this location is motivated by the belief that the horror and urgency of the situation in   demands an urgent and extraordinary response from the people of the world.”", "tags": ["law", "(australia)", "sydney", "gaza", "protest", "new", "south", "wales", "new", "south", "wales", "politics", "analysis"]},

The latest edition of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s  , the world’s most comprehensive global inventory on extinction risk, has declared the Christmas Island shrew is extinct. The news may not seem momentous. After all, most Australians know nothing of shrews and would be unaware this one species counted among our native fauna. But the shrew’s extinction increases the tally of Australian mammals extinct since 1788 to  . This is far more than for any other country. These losses represent about 10% of all Australia’s land mammal species before colonisation. It is a deplorable record of trashing an extraordinary legacy. Shrews are small, long-nosed, insect-eating mammals, with many species widely distributed across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. On mainland Australia, similar roles are filled by unrelated small marsupials such as dunnarts, antechinuses, planigales and ningauis, which are themselves not writ large on our national consciousness. Many people will know of shrews only courtesy of Shakespeare. Combining misogyny and zoophobia (an intense fear of animals), he   of this inoffensive animal to describe a shrill, ever-complaining, grating caricature of women. The offensive term has stuck through the ages, draining sympathy for and interest in the animal. It must have been a harrowing voyage. Tens of thousands of years ago, a small family of shrews (or a pregnant female) rafted on floating vegetation, from islands of what is now Indonesia. Haphazardly, they landed on uninhabited Christmas Island, now an Australian territory about 1,500km west of the mainland. These lucky or reckless pioneers gave rise to Australia’s only shrew species. For many years the Christmas Island shrew prospered. When European naturalists first visited Christmas Island in the 1890s, at the time of its settlement,  : This little animal is extremely common all over the island, and at night its shrill shriek, like the cry of a bat, can be heard on all sides. Change came quickly thereafter. In 1900, black rats  , stowaways on hay bales. Worse, these rats were infested with trypanosomes, a cellular parasite. These trypanosomes spread rapidly to the island’s two species of native rats (and presumably the shrew). The long isolation of Christmas Island had cocooned its native mammals, leaving them with no resistance to new diseases. Within a year, island residents began seeing many dying rats stumbling across the forest floor. By the time naturalists next visited the island  , the two species of native rats and the Christmas Island shrew were thought to have become extinct. Subsequently, many other endemic animals were also lost or suffered serious declines due to the introduction of cats and invasive species of ants, snails, plants, giant centipedes, birds and snakes. It is a pattern that has   across the world’s islands. Introductions of plants and animals have subverted island ecosystems and, as a consequence, endemic island species represent a disproportionately high number of the world’s extinctions. But the shrew lived on. After not being seen for more than 50 years, two survivors were caught in the 1950s as bulldozers cleared a patch of rainforest for mining. The shrews were released and the find was not reported until many years later. Then, nothing for another 30 years. In December 1984, biologists Hugh Yorkston and Jeff Tranter were clearing a rainforest track and came across a live female shrew in a clump of fallen birds’ nest fern. They kept the shrew in a terrarium for 12-18 months, industriously catching grasshoppers to feed it. At the time, they didn’t consider this a final opportunity to conserve the species through a captive breeding program. When, with extraordinary serendipity, a male shrew was found alive only a few months later in March 1985, it was kept in a separate terrarium. The female was docile but the male was aggressive. It also appeared unwell. Whatever the reason, there was no introduction, no consummation and no baby shrews. The male died about three weeks after capture while the female lingered on, alone. Since 1984, there have been no recorded sightings. This means only four Christmas Island shrews have been reported in  . Almost no information on the biology of this species has been published, other than the single sentence written by naturalist Charles Andrews  : It lives in holes in rocks and roots of trees, and seems to feed mainly on beetles. There are few pictures. However, inklings of the nature of the last known shrew can be seen in a beautiful sketch by the park ranger, naturalist and artist Max Orchard. In the nearly 40 years since the death of the last known individual,   have been compiled, outlining the actions needed to conserve the species. There have been targeted searches. But no shrews have turned up to benefit from those plans. The most telling evidence of their extinction is the absence of any shrews in the stomach contents of hundreds of feral cats culled over the past few decades. While the shrew clearly survived until the 1980s, this decade saw the arrival of yet another threat, the Asian wolf snake. This snake quickly spread across the island, most likely causing the extinction of the island’s endemic microbat, the  , in 2009 and most of the  . The snake’s arrival also probably marked the death knell for any remaining shrews. Extinction can be difficult to prove, especially for a species as cryptic as the shrew. There is peril in categorising a species as extinct when it still survives. This misclassification has been termed the “ ”, where formal recognition of a species as extinct can result in the withdrawal of funding or protection, and hence increase likelihood of actual extinction. In 2022, the Australian government through then environment minister Tanya Plibersek pledged, admirably, to preventing any  . Although the formal recognition of the shrew’s extinction comes after that pledge, the last shrew probably died one to two decades beforehand. The shrew’s loss is a reminder of the enormity of the challenge of preventing further extinctions, of the diverse ways these losses can happen, of the need to seize opportunities to protect rare species, and of the importance of a national and political  . I hope the Christmas Island shrew is not extinct; after all it has defied previous calls of its demise. Perhaps somewhere, a small furtive family of shrews are hanging on, elusive survivors, secure in the knowledge of their own existence and waiting to prove the pessimists wrong.

The airline is one of more than 40 firms globally caught up in the hack, reported to contain up to 1bn customer records. The hacker collective Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters released an extortion note on a data leaks site on the dark web last week, demanding payment in return for preventing the stolen data from being shared. The Qantas data, which was stolen from a Salesforce database  , included customers’ email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers. It did not contain credit card details, financial information or passport details. On Saturday the group marked the data as “leaked”, writing: “Don’t be the next headline, should have paid the ransom.” Jeremy Kirk, analyst at Intel 471, a cyber threat intelligence company, said 44 companies had been included in the leak including Gap, Vietnam Airlines, Toyota, Disney, McDonald’s, Ikea, and Adidas. He said the hacker group was well known and operated out of countries such as the US, UK and Australia. “This particular group is not a new threat; they’ve been around for some time,” Kirk said. “But they’re very skilled in knowing how companies have connected different systems together.” A Qantas spokesperson previously told Guardian Australia its priorities were “continued vigilance and providing ongoing support for our customers” after the June attack. “We continue to offer a 24/7 support line and specialist identity protection advice to affected customers,” the spokesperson said. A Salesforce spokesperson told Guardian Australia the company “will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand”. There was no indication the Salesforce platform had been compromised, the company said via a statement. “We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support,” it said. It is understood the global data was stolen between April 2024 and September 2025 and includes personal and contact information of the companies’ customers and employees, including dates of birth, purchase histories and passport numbers. “No company wants to see hundreds of thousands, or millions, of records of their customers just on the internet,” Kirk said. “That’s awful. It’s awful for the companies. It’s awful for the people affected.” In July, Qantas obtained an ongoing injunction from the NSW supreme court ensuring protections to prevent the stolen data being accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published by anyone, including third parties. Kirk said there was no financial data but criminals could potentially use leaked personal information to open credit cards. He said people should monitor their accounts for suspicious activity, and beware of scam emails that are personalised. “These days, a lot of threat groups are now generating personalised phishing emails,” he said. “They’re getting better and better at this – and these types of breaches help sort of fuel that economy, that underground fraudster economy.” Qantas has been contacted for comment.", "tags": ["qantas", "cybercrime", "airline", "industry", "business", "news"]},

A group who have signed up for a prospecting tour greet each other on the verandah, staff chat with customers seeking advice on various detection devices, and several others have just turned up for a yarn. All are drawn by a special kind of sickness: gold fever. Maryborough is located at the centre of Victoria’s Golden Triangle – an area encompassing Ballarat, Bendigo and Wedderburn, which produced some of the world’s largest alluvial nuggets during the gold rush of the 1850s. It is still one of the most popular destinations in the world for prospectors, including Alaskan couple Keith and Marilyn Fye, who were in the midst of a gold-themed holiday. “From Sydney, we came down through Albury, then stayed in Yackandandah to see the Eldorado dredge, and we’ll visit Sovereign Hill in Ballarat,” says Marilyn. “I feel a little more in touch with the meaning of it coming over here. I mean, gold has a value no matter what part of the planet you’re in, and there’s also a global community around it.” Since January, the spot price of gold has risen by 45% to a record high of A$5,900 an ounce, its   caused a 126% spike in 1979. Analysts predict it may go higher still but, according to the Gold Centre’s owner, Andrew Gladdis, there’s no sign of a fresh gold rush just yet. “People are definitely putting more effort into finding gold now, and they’re selling rather than keeping, because of the price, but I would say there were more getting into prospecting during Covid,” he says. Perhaps this is because the most valuable tool you need to find gold is time. This becomes apparent when tour guide Lachy Green takes his budding prospectors out to a test pad, just north of Maryborough. “To give you a rough idea, in eight hours of detecting with a coil of this size, you’re probably going to cover just over a tennis court of ground in a day,” Green tells his amateur gold diggers. Each wields a gold detector coil – the round disc at the end of the detector shaft that sends out an electromagnetic field to find metal objects. Gold detectors – worth anywhere between $1,500 and $10,800 – generally operate at a higher frequency than regular metal detector coils. Before you even start scouring your chosen patch, he explains, you need to set up the machine to minimise detection of “false targets”. First, you need to tune out as much electromagnetic interference as possible. If set to a “noisy” frequency, a detector can “woo woo” at power lines, radio signals or even a lightning strike in the next shire. Then there’s a ground balance, which is especially important in central Victoria, where there are high levels of mineralisation. “Basically, the machine should have a nice, flat hum,” says Green. “Some run a bit more upset than others, but you’re sort of dumbing it down to ignore that mineralisation.” Sign up to  Subscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairs after newsletter promotion Back in the Gold Centre’s car park, excited western Sydney retiree Rusty Dobson has just purchased a new coil. “My wife thinks I’d do better off stacking the shelves at Woolworths but, when you’re out there swinging that detector, you’re in the game for something big,” he says. “That thrill that just gets into your blood, and I also love birdlife, so it’s like bushwalking with fringe benefits.” Later that day in Fryerstown, about 55km east of Maryborough, a small crowd gathers for the unveiling of a monument to commemorate the discovery of the Heron nugget in 1855. At 1,008 ounces (28.5kg), this was the biggest single find in the Forest Creek/Mount Alexander diggings, considered the richest shallow alluvial goldfield the world has ever seen. The event is part of an effort by the Prospectors and Miners Association of Victoria to publicise the role gold played in Australia’s colonial history. “Victoria was built on gold,” the association’s president, Jason Cornish, says. “Melbourne was the richest city in the world at one stage, and towns up this way – like Castlemaine and Chewton – they wouldn’t even exist today without the goldfields. The association is vehemently opposed to a Victorian government proposal to increase the cost of miner’s right permits, which allow prospectors to keep what they find. There are almost 100,000 current miner’s rights in Victoria. The permit costs $28.60 and lasts for 10 years, but the Victorian government wishes to raise that to $93.10. Whatever the initial outlay, gold’s value is in its scarcity, something Maryborough resident Robyn Calhoun is only too aware of after six months of prospecting. “I’d love to trip over a nugget, but I’ve only found a metal button so far,” she says. “But it’s good exercise, and I love being out in the bush.”  Stuart Walmsley is a photojournalist based in Castlemaine, Victoria  ", "tags": ["rural", "australia", "the", "rural", "network", "victoria", "gold", "commodities", "features"]},

(One exception has stood out: a legal resistance led by a patchwork coalition of lawyers, public interest groups, Democratic state attorneys general, and unions has frustrated Trump’s ambitions. Hundreds of attorneys and plaintiffs have stood up to him, feeding a steady assembly line of setbacks and judicial reprimands for a president who has systematically sought to break down limits on his own power.) Australians are woefully ill-informed about the nation’s founding document yet still wrap it in aspic. Blackfella Films tackles this in the new series The Idea of Australia, based on my book of the same name,  . The second episode focuses on the making of the nation and features a series of vox pops at the Federation Dome in Sydney’s Centennial Park. The interviews were shot less than a year after the 2023 referendum, but even in this most affluent and highly educated part of Australia, those walking in the park that day knew little about the constitution or federation. “I don’t know much about that stuff,” one young man said suggesting “Captain Cook invaded Australia with a bunch of convicts at Port Botany”. I don’t blame him or the others interviewed. Civic education in Australia is slapdash at best, and the incentives to not pay attention are seductive. This is why the community independents movement is such a threat to the status quo, as it demands people accept responsibility locally and personally, and imagine and exercise their political agency. Conservative political leaders like to talk about rights   responsibilities. The primary responsibility of any citizen is to pay attention – only then can informed decisions be made and change occur.  , but as we are witnessing in the US, there are no guarantees.

I uprooted myself from New South Wales and headed to Alice Springs to work as a GP. A year later we were all so happy we decided to stay. Three years later, in 2007, I’d made a great group of friends who were always trying to matchmake me. One suggested I meet an old friend of theirs, the mysterious “Jungle Jim”. He was ex-air force and had four children – which, to be honest, seemed a little daunting – but I was open. As the worst of the summer heat subsided, a barbecue was orchestrated for us to get acquainted. I still remember the white skirt and orange shirt I was wearing – I felt I’d made an effort – and then in walks this fella with boots and jeans carrying a big white cooler. Twenty years later he still has them all. We sat down, chit-chatted and I thought he was cute; then he started talking about training for the Kokoda trail and taking two of his sons with him. He told me: “I just want to smell the jungle again.” And that was the first moment I thought, “Wow, who is this guy?” He said he recalled a scent from his childhood that he longed for; it rang true for me. There was a big Australian rules football match on TV and it was all very blokey but as the night went on my friends asked him how he was getting on after his separation. When he replied that it had been a bit rough and he’d sought the help of a psychologist, I really did a double take. As a doctor, especially back then, I knew it was rare for men to be open about mental health struggles. To me it really spoke to his self-confidence and honesty. Especially because he presented as such an alpha male. He’s loud, he’s big, he laughs a lot and yet here he was being so open about these vulnerabilities. It was a very attractive juxtaposition. As my friend and I were doing the dishes and organising the dessert I’d brought along, she asked what I thought and, before I knew what I was saying, I blurted out: “I could fall in love with this man.” This was totally out of character for me. I’d like to think I remained casual but I was bursting out of my skin. I gave him my number and waited, and waited, and waited. The following Saturday I got an invitation for a Sunday-night drink. It happened to be Mother’s Day and my parents had just flown in for their wedding anniversary. Despite the timing, I didn’t hesitate to make it work. He came striding into the pub 10 minutes late, not a worry in the world. We talked non-stop for three hours. It turned out we had so much in common, we were both born to expats, me to Indian parents in Uganda, he to Scottish parents in Papua New Guinea, both our fathers were engineers and we had arrived in Australia in the early 70s. I had an early flight for work so I couldn’t get carried away, but over the next few weeks we made time to get together for a few dates and took our kids on some adventures. He met my parents too. He charmed the socks off my mother, complimenting her home cooking as he did a few handyman jobs. He even asked her for her pickle recipe – I’ve never made pickles in my life. Again I was agape: who is this guy? Sign up to  Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips after newsletter promotion We were both careful not to rush things on account of our kids but I was impressed by what a wonderful dad he was and what lovely young men he was raising. I also knew he held a high security clearance because of his job at Pine Gap, so I was confident I wasn’t dealing with a rogue character. Eighteen months later we took all six kids to Thailand on a family holiday and had a ball. Our international outlook so obviously informed the way we were raising our respective kids. We moved in together not long afterwards. In 2011 the two of us took a trip to India and the question of marriage hung in the air. We visited the Taj Mahal in the morning and I’d made assumptions, but no proposal came. I was salty for the rest of the day. But when we went back for the sunset viewing he asked me if I wanted to be his wife. Later at dinner I asked him if he was worried I’d say no. He replied: “I was more worried about what would happen to me if I didn’t ask you.” My initial feelings for Jim were so powerful and unexpected that I didn’t really trust them; I never believed in love at first sight. But all the pieces of our puzzle fell together. Jim is still a bloke’s bloke but underneath it all it’s that softness, caring and loyalty that never fails to remind me of how I fell for him over a footy match and sticky date pudding.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/12/how-can-liberal-party-sussan-ley-appeal-younger-voters", "content": "hree months after the Liberal party’s federal electoral drubbing, Sussan Ley met a group of New South Wales candidates at an intimate gathering in Penrith, in Sydney’s west, to thank them for running. At the dinner, attended by about 20 candidates, several told the new leader the party had lost the social media battle during the election campaign. Labor were quicker, savvier, and used more AI to generate content, they told Ley, recounting the event on condition of anonymity. This was a symptom, they said, of the Liberals failing to reach a critical demographic: gen Z and millennials. The typical Liberal voter is now an “older, white, regional man”, pollsters say, a base that is dying. The Liberal party is facing an internal fight over its future direction, with Andrew Hastie sensationally   over a split with Ley on immigration. Hastie had made a series of provocative and public policy interventions, suggesting on social media high overseas immigration made Australians “feel like strangers in our own home”. He says that trigger for his resignation was that he was told he would not have a role in the formation of the Coalition’s immigration policy, despite holding the home affairs portfolio. It puts Ley, who has tried to steer the party towards a more centrist and moderate direction, under further pressure from a loud and   on the right. Tony Barry, a pollster with Redbridge and former deputy state director for the Victorian Liberals, says the party is targeting its message to older people, while younger people move away. “Some of those conservative milestones which produce more conservative voting behaviours are happening later in life, such as home ownership and starting families,” he says. “And whilst you don’t become a conservative because you buy a house, it is one of those milestones that does change voting patterns. “You can’t create conservatives if they’ve got nothing to conserve.” Young people are not necessarily flocking to Labor either, Barry says, but communicating directly to them is one of the biggest challenges for the Liberals. “Getting into those algorithms is incredibly challenging for all political communicators, which is why vertical content is so important these days.” The numbers paint a bleak picture for the future of the party. Redbridge polling between August and September shows just 13% of gen Z women and 22% of gen Z men supporting the Coalition. Its support goes up gradually with each generation: millennials (25% women, 28% men); gen X (34% women; 30% men); and boomers (36% women, 40% men). For Labor, the lowest support is from gen Z women at 25% while the highest is gen Z men at 42%. The minor parties are also picking up key demographics – the Greens have a high level of popularity among gen Z women (42%) while One Nation has a higher degree of support among gen X men (17%). The executive director of the polling company Essential, Peter Lewis, says gen Z women are twice as likely to vote for the Greens as they are for the Coalition. Essential’s numbers vary slightly from Redbridge’s, but tell the same story. “We don’t give people a formal exit interview when they leave this mortal coil, but people who are dying are 65% [Coalition voters], people joining the roll, turning 18, are 25% [Coalition voters],” Lewis says. “That represents a generational handicap which means that every cycle, all else being equal apart from age, the Liberal party share of the electorate is diminishing.” Sign up to  Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Redbridge’s data also shows people who speak a language other than English at home are more likely to support Labor. Its August-September survey shows 34% of Australians who speak English at home support Labor while 31% support the Coalition. But for households who speak another language, 43% support Labor compared with 21% for the Coalition. And 41% of those born in another country support Labor, while 30% support the Coalition. The former Howard government minister Amanda Vanstone says it is difficult to ascribe particular demographics to a political party, but it is clear there are two groups who aren’t engaging with the Liberals. “Is the Liberal party appealing to young people enough? No, clearly not, and probably not to a wide enough range of new migrants,” she says. She says the party is facing a similar problem with young people that it did when she first entered parliament. Vanstone, a moderate, says when she joined the Liberals in the 1970s, while finishing her university degree, the party didn’t speak to people like her. “You’ve got all those funny old men in three-piece pinstripe suits with waistcoats and gold club watches, and they [didn’t] speak my language at all. “And I think the Liberal party is in a similar position now. Someone … in their mid 20s might not feel like the Liberal party talks to them.” Younger generations now dominate the electoral roll, with gen Z and millennials to making up more than 50% of voters at the 2028 election. Vanstone says “narcissists” in the party, both current and former members, are exacerbating the problem, and making it irrelevant to the majority of voters. “There are too many people in [the party], and who have retired from parliament, who think their job is to convince the electorate that what they think is what everyone should think – in other words, they see themselves as the holder of the truth. “That of course is a complete disaster – one, because it shows you’re … a narcissist, but also you have no respect for what the electorate might think.” Vanstone says as the population changes the party has to “adapt with it”. Ley has said politicians should not put an “artificial divide” between generations, telling reporters in September young people feel debt – student loans and household bills – like any other Australian. “Let’s not put an artificial divide between young people and older people … even though there are differences, of course, but in terms of values, [there are] values that unite every sector in Australian society,” she said.", "tags": ["liberal", "party", "coalition", "australian", "politics", "sussan", "ley", "andrew", "hastie", "features"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/10/first-brands-wall-street", "content": "Financial problems at the maker of spark plugs, wiper blades, brake calipers, brake shoes, tow hitches and motor oil has caused intense anxiety on Wall Street in recent weeks. Car parts are not usually something that causes finance chiefs to lose much sleep. But the potentially multibillion-dollar financial crisis surrounding First Brands has them rattled. As ever in finance, it’s what investors don’t know that scares the most, and with First Brands, there appears to be plenty. First Brands was founded by the Malaysian-born businessman Patrick James. Starting life as Ohio-based Crowne Group, James acquired Trico, best known for windshield wipers, and went on a debt-fueled acquisitions spree, snapping up auto-focused parts makers. James rechristening the company as First Brands Group in 2020. It now owns 24 automotive-related companies, according to the  . “If your car is 10 years old, odds are good that parts from these companies are already on there,”   “And they were probably half the cost of original equipment parts sold through dealerships.” The company filed for bankruptcy protection in the southern district of Texas on 29 September due to creditor concern over the company’s use of opaque off-balance sheet financing, listing liabilities – what it owed – between $10bn and $50bn against assets – what it owned – of between $1bn and $10bn. But the speed of the First Brands implosion has spooked investors, and the more that’s known, the more they are spooked. The company had until recently had a decent cash buffer, but it was using private debt or “shadow banking” to borrow against invoices, in effect keeping debt off its balance-sheet disclosures, and turning a company with 26,000 employees into a finance company more than the supplier of auto parts. That system, known as factoring, is not unusual. But when the size of that debt, and who is holding it, becomes obscure, problems can rapidly accumulate, as the financial industry saw with the collapse of the UK fintech  Capital in 2021 and London-listed firm   in 2018. On Thursday, the technology group Raistone, which arranged some off-balance sheet financing, claimed that as much as $2.3bn had “simply vanished” as part of the bankrupt auto supplier’s failure. Jim Chanos, who predicted the Enron disaster in 2001,  that complex financial systems tend to flourish at the tail end of a boom when everyone wants in. “As long as everything works, nobody asks questions,” he said. “It isn’t until something stumbles, or the markets stumble, that people say, ‘Wait a minute, what are we doing here? This doesn’t make any sense.’” Just as in other financial crises – most recently the housing crisis that led to the 2008 financial meltdown – Wall Street is worried that the issues at First Brands are a sign of worse to come. The Texas auto lender Tricolor – which specialized in lending to low-income “sub-prime” lenders – collapsed last month amid  . Ben Lourie, professor of accounting at the University of California, Irvine, says the issues at First Brands, and the collapse of  , connect because one was selling cut-price parts, and the other older cars, to consumers under economic pressure. “My guess is the companies went into bankruptcy because the market is not great and they started doing things they should not be doing. So they went into financial innovation with invoice financing,” Lourie says. “The fear is that the private debt market has been too hot, and [has been] giving out money, at high interest rates, to companies that just can’t pay it back, and especially to companies in the auto market,” he adds. Fears over what the failure of both companies portends are highlighting worries about what other issues the private debt markets may face. “The private debt market is much bigger than it used to be, and we can see that by companies pulling their IPOs because they are raising money in those markets,” says Lourie. “But there isn’t as much disclosure as there is in the public markets. So there is a disclosure issue because we don’t really know what’s going on.” He adds: “When there isn’t as much disclosure, there’s more risk, and there’s a fear of contagion, because somebody is going to have to take on these losses, and eventually it will reach up into the banks.” Jefferies, a midsized Wall Street lender, was advising First Brands, acting as lender against invoices through a specialist invoice-finance fund it manages, Point Bonita Capital, and placing billions of dollars of loans with other investors. Who those investors are, and how far the chain of debt stretches into the mainstream banking system, is an open question. Jefferies says it has $715m in exposure to First Brands. An investigation has been set up in part to examine whether invoices were pledged more than once. But it goes further, with concerns mounting that First Brands’ precarious arrangements could be found elsewhere. Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, says concerns are primarily about unregulated private debt markets and the assets they hold that are often not marked-to-market, an accounting system that values a company’s assets and liabilities at their current fair market value. “When these assets become impaired, it’s a surprise to markets, because there hadn’t been a gradual updating of information,” House says, “and because we don’t have great transparency on the location and concentration of where these assets are being held. And that can often have knock-on effects that are unanticipated.” The worry is that the collapse of an obscure car parts company is the first domino, and that if more dominoes collapse, it could spread across the financial system, eventually triggering a wider crisis. Severe problems in the financial markets caused not by macro-economic conditions, but by the intricacies of capital management have happened before – the collapse of a high leveraged hedge fund,   in 1998, that required a $3.6bn bailout, or the subprime mortgage loan crisis of 2007 that caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the onset of severe financial recession. Such analogies may not be exact, since the problems now being unearthed relate to private debt markets that expanded significantly after banks tightened lending standards after the 2008 crash. “The risk may sit in the balance sheets of funds and other asset managers that may create counterparty risk for large financial institutions that can cause reverberations from relatively obscure small funds hitting problems and create a cascading effect through the financial system that gets amplified by the structure of different asset classes and is unanticipated because of a lack of transparency,” says House. “It effectively means that unregulated parts of the debt and asset management market may hold risks that have implications for the entire financial system.”", "tags": ["business", "us", "politics", "explainers"]},

The president will most likely be apoplectic over data confirming that the economy is generating very few new jobs (the payroll processor  a loss of 32,000 private sector jobs in September).  the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the jobs numbers, after a lackluster report published in August. But in the office of his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, champagne is likely to flow. For Miller, the dismal job growth is largely due to the war against immigrants he has masterminded from his perch on the White House’s second floor. The cognitive disconnect ultimately stems from a stubborn misrepresentation preached across the administration about the impact of immigrants on the American economy: that every immigrant expelled from the workforce frees up a job to be readily filled by an unemployed American. In  : “Mass deportation will be a labor-market disruption celebrated by American workers, who will now be offered higher wages with better benefits to fill these jobs.” This is what inspired the agriculture secretary   that farmers who lost their workforce to an Ice raid should have their crops picked by Medicaid recipients who need a job to keep their benefits. It explains   in August when a government report suggested,  , that there had been a   in the immigrant workforce and a   in the number of Americans with a job, a pattern that turned out to be a  . As economists repeatedly try to explain to the likes of Vance and Miller, the economy doesn’t work like that. A newly deported migrant does not yield an employed native. Indeed, the deportation is likely to cause employers to let go of American workers too. What deportations do achieve is to reduce the labor force. The native-born workforce  . Hiring is slow largely because kicking migrants out means there are fewer workers to hire. At the end of the day, the White House’s attempts to rid the labor market of immigrant workers will cripple American prosperity – damaging industries that rely on immigrant labor, from agriculture to hospitality and eldercare to healthcare. Businesses will shrink and even go under, punishing the American workers who toil alongside the foreign-born. American history keeps teaching us the same lesson: the prosperity of this land relies on immigrant work. Somebody let Trump know. Consider the previous attempt at mass deportation. About 424,000 undocumented immigrants were “removed” from 2010 to 2015 under the “Secure Communities” program during the administration of Barack Obama. Studying the impact on the workplace as the program was implemented county by county over four years, economists from the University of Colorado   the 3.5% fall in the employment of immigrants as Secure Communities rolled out was associated with a 0.5% decline in the employment of citizens. A few decades prior, the end of the   in December of 1964 excluded almost half a million Mexican seasonal farm workers, who had been coming to plant and harvest crops since the 1940s.  , the demise of the Bracero program did nothing to raise the employment or wages of native farm workers. Farmers who could, mostly those growing tomato, beet and cotton, mechanized production. But they didn’t pay more. Nor did the mass “repatriations” of hundreds of Mexican immigrants and their US-born children during the Great Depression improve the lot of American workers. Rather,   that the employment and wages of native workers declined in the most affected counties. On the flipside of this dynamic, economists studying immigration over the first two decades of this century   the inflow raised the wages of less educated native workers, those with at most a high school diploma. Their   those of studies of the immigration wave of the early 20th century that found it spurred industrial production and increased native employment. Native workers left immigrant-heavy jobs – manual laborers, waiters, blacksmiths and the like – and took higher-wage positions as foremen, electricians or engineers. After Congress passed the nation’s first-ever national immigration quotas in the 1920s, driving immigration down over the coming four decades, businesses in affected areas responded in   – drawing workers from other states and other countries, introducing labor-saving technology or reducing production. The impact on native workers was, at best, ambiguous. These outcomes are not hard to comprehend. Whatever Trump, Miller and co are trying to spin, understanding the impact of immigration requires looking at its impact on businesses, which will invest to profit from the additional labor, as well as on the occupational decisions of native workers, who will move to better jobs out of immigrants’ reach. Barring immigrants from the economy will reverberate beyond the labor market. Just like during the second world war, when the exclusion of Japanese farm workers   and output by pushing the most productive farmers off the fields, kicking out foreign graduates will strain America’s pool of   and limit the number of  .

While Trump’s draconian treatment of immigrants and their communities might strike many as inhumane, many Americans have come to believe immigration amounts to a problem rather than an opportunity. This would not be the first time in history that this nation of immigrants turns against its most defining feature. It is, however, a perilous moment to do so.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/11/fifa-2026-world-cup-tickets-dynamic-pricing-nft-resale", "content": "hen the first tickets for the 2026 World Cup went on sale last week, millions of fans joined online queues only to discover what Gianni Infantino’s assurance that “the world will be welcome” really means. The cheapest face-value seat for next summer’s final, somewhere in the gods of New Jersey’s 82,500-seat MetLife Stadium where the players are specks and the football’s a rumor, comes at a cost of $2,030 (oxygen tank not included). Most upper-deck seats range from $2,790 to $4,210, according to customers   that had been closely guarded. The   for group-stage games, propped up by Fifa as evidence of affordability, exist only as comically tiny green smudges on the edge of digital seating maps, little more than mirages of inclusivity. Fifa had kept the costs under wraps until the very moment of sale, replacing the usual published table of price points with a digital lottery that decided who even got the chance to buy. Millions spent hours staring at a queue screen as algorithms determined their place in line. When access finally came for most, the lower-priced sections had already vanished, many presumably hoovered up by bots and bulk-buyers (and that’s before Fifa quietly raised the prices of at least nine matches  ). The whole process resembled less a ticket release than a psyop to calibrate how much frustration and scarcity the public will tolerate. This, Fifa insists, is merely an adaptation to “market norms” in the United States, where most matches will be staged, as though gouging fans were a cultural practice to be respected like  . In a sense, they’re bang-on. Profiteering and exploitation have long served as America’s articles of faith in the absence of a national religion. In reality, what’s taking shape is less a global festival of soccer than a fintech laboratory for everything that has made contemporary entertainment so exhausting. The governing body has fused together every irritant of modern consumer life – dynamic pricing, algorithmic lotteries, endless logins, even the remnants of a failed crypto boom – into a single soul-deadening experience designed to turn access itself into a commodity. This is the World Cup re-engineered for the Ticketmaster-Live Nation monopoly era, where the thrill of fandom meets the calculus of hedge-fund speculation. The story began during the NFT craze of 2022, when Fifa launched Fifa+ Collect, promising fans “affordable ownership” of digital soccer moments – Pelé lifting the 1970 trophy, Maradona’s 1986 solo run, Kylian Mbappé’s goal in the 2018 final – each sold as a blockchain collectible. When the market collapsed (quelle surprise), Fifa reheated its own nachos by quietly rebadging the tokens as ticketing opportunities. The new scheme, marketed under the chillingly corporate   (RTB) name, offers supporters the chance to purchase NFTs that would   to purchase an actual match ticket. A   token costs up to $999 and can be redeemed only if the buyer’s chosen team reaches the final. If not, it becomes a useless JPEG. Fifa discovered how to monetize anticipation itself, a system that traffics not in tickets but in Fomo. That illusion was finally shattered this week, when Fifa Collect administrators disclosed that the vast majority of Right to Buy holders   for Category 1 and 2 seats, the priciest brackets in Fifa’s opening phase at costs far beyond the reach of the average punter. The news triggered open revolt among the NFT community: Discord threads filled with complaints of being “ripped off” and a sudden rush to resell tokens as their market value collapsed. When the real tickets finally appeared, the scale of the escalation became clear. Category 1 seats for the semi-finals approach $3,000; quarter-finals nearly $1,700. Fifa’s new dynamic pricing model means those numbers can, and surely will, rise signficantly higher. The technique, borrowed from airlines and Silicon Valley ticket platforms, now governs the world’s biggest sporting event, creating a byzantine and hierarchical marketplace carved into endless tiers of privilege. At past World Cups, resale prices were capped at face value. For 2026, Fifa lifted that restriction and moved into the secondary market itself. Tickets on   have already appeared for tens of thousands of dollars, including a $2,030 ticket for the final was relisted the next day for $25,000. Fifa double-dips by taking a 15% commission from the seller   another 15% from the buyer, pocketing $300 for every $1,000 traded. Officials claim this will discourage scalpers from using outside sites such as StubHub. In practice it legitimizes them, as though the easiest way to beat the touts was simply to host them. By the time a ticket is finally scanned at the turnstile on matchday, it may have been bought, flipped and resold three or four times, every trade skimming another cut into Fifa’s coffers. It’s less a ticketing system than a financial instrument, and suddently   for ticket and hospitality revenue doesn’t seem so quixotic. Supporters’ groups have responded with predictable disbelief and outrage. Thomas Concannon of England’s Fans’ Embassy called the prices “astonishing”, pointing out that following a team through the tournament on the cheapest tickets would cost more than double the equivalent journey in Qatar. Add in transatlantic travel, accommodation and visa restrictions, and the so-called “most inclusive   ever” begins to look an awful lot like a gated community. Ronan Evain of Fans Europe called it “the privatization of what was once a tournament open to all”, arguing that Fifa is building “a World Cup for middle-class Westerners and the happy few who can enter the US”. In Mexico, where resale laws have something resembling teeth, Fifa relented to government pressure and capped prices at face value on a localized ticket exchange platform. Everywhere else, the late-stage free-market grift carries on unchecked. The logic is simple: scarcity drives profit, and even disappointment can be monetized. Fifa’s defense leans heavily on American precedent. Concert promoters and major leagues have used dynamic pricing for years and resale sites routinely charge similar fees. But invoking “market norms” misses the point. Soccer’s global ritual isn’t meant to mimic the Super Bowl or the Eras Tour by normalizing the abusive consumer practices Americans resigned themselves to years ago. It was meant to belong to everyone: the traveling supporters, the families, the people who transform neutral stadiums into carnivals of color and noise. The 2026 rollout exposes a new frontier of sports capitalism: the monetization of emotion. Fifa has built an ecosystem in which every feeling – excitement, anxiety, devotion – becomes a revenue stream. Fear of missing out? There’s a token for that. Late-stage panic? Dynamic pricing will account for it. Regret? The resale platform will take another 30%. Buying a ticket is no longer an act of fandom but of speculation, a wager placed on both your team’s fortunes and one’s own disposable income. The parallels with the spiraling economics of the live music industry  . With concerts, the explosion of VIP “packages” and velvet-rope pricing has turned performance into a gated spectacle and audience into clientele. With soccer, the same transformation is under way. Stadiums once defined by chaos and community are being remade as climate-controlled malls of efficiency: perfect sightlines, perfect sound and prices that erase the very imperfection that made the experience human. When ordinary fans are priced out, what’s left is a sport stripped of its edge and flattened into entertainment. Fifa says that every dollar generated by ticket sales goes back into the game, as it stressed  , like that shopworn talking point were a moral shield. Yet what’s being returned to the game is a recalibrated worldview: that soccer, like every other corner of modern life, can be measured, segmented and commodified. In the process, the world’s most democratic sport becomes an exercise in exclusion, where the right to belong is determined by AI and a balance sheet. Infantino keeps repeating that 2026 will be “the biggest, best and most inclusive World Cup ever”. On the first count he’ll surely be right and on the second he may be, but a World Cup priced as a luxury brand is destined to fall spectacularly short of the third. The dream football once offered of common ground and of shared joy has been bought, repackaged and sold back at a markup.

About 200 local residents packed the small hall at Kelvin Grove state college in Brisbane that night for a meeting organised by the protest group Save Victoria Park, which is campaigning against a state and federal government-funded plan to build a $3.8bn   at the site. One stood up to ask how far people were willing to go: would they take “direct action” to prevent the venue set to host the Games’ opening and closing ceremonies from being built? , a former premier and Brisbane lord mayor, gingerly put his hand up. If he does, the conservative who once campaigned as “Can Do Campbell” might end up linking arms with socialists and other former political enemies. Sitting next to him was the former Labor deputy mayor of Brisbane, David Hinchliffe, also with his hand firmly up. Then there’s the  Jonathan Sriranganathan, a self-described “anarcho-communitarian” and firm opponent of the stadium plan. “It’s an uneasy alliance, we’re not quite strange bedfellows; we’re not necessarily even in the same bed!” Sriranganathan said of the coalition of campaigners from all political persuasions. “But people with very different views of the world are aligned on this issue.” Brisbane’s Olympics were supposed to bring the city together for a few weeks on the world’s stage. Instead, the city is divided over plans that include the demolition of the historic Gabba stadium and the construction of the Games’ main stadium and a 25,000-seat national aquatic centre at Victoria Park – which comes after the LNP premier, David Crisafulli,   not to build a new Olympic stadium. “We’re going to fight, we’re not giving up. We’re going to win this. This is the wrong place,” Newman told the room in August to cheers. Relaying a conversation with an anonymous establishment figure and a friend, Newman said he was told “the whole Olympics will be upended” if they won their fight. “And I said, ‘Well, I don’t want that to happen, but that’s your fault.’” Victoria Park, or Barrambin, is also a  . Save Victoria Park is   to the Olympics plan under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, appealing to the federal environment minister, Murray Watt, to use his powers to halt the project. The volunteers of Save Victoria Park have been a blizzard of action since the LNP’s plan was announced in March, writing press releases and reports (the latest, released this week, claims the stadium cannot be completed in time), petitioning, organising protests and holding public meetings. Earlier this year, the state’s deputy premier and planning minister, Jarrod Bleijie, moved to thwart many legal challenges by  , including the Heritage Act and the Planning Act. The federal government will require the state to consult with the community about its venue plans, but asked in September if he would continue with the plan for Victoria Park if the community said it didn’t want a stadium, Bleijie simply said “yes”. In a written statement, Bleijie said the Crisafulli government “is delivering a generational infrastructure legacy across   ahead of 2032” and that the legislation “accelerates the delivery of Games infrastructure on time, on budget”. Retired games developer Matthew Ford, a member of Save Victoria Park, isn’t waiting for stadium works to begin to take direct action. He hosts a   game in the park, his local, on a weekly basis, serving as dungeon master. Alongside his wizard hat and staff, he wears a chain on his leg, locking himself to a concrete table. “I think that people have to stand up for their values and to me, the value of protecting greenery, protecting habitat, and showing that it matters and standing up to development is important,” he said. “People like me will lock themselves on. People like me will disobey.” At an event picketed by protesters this week, the minister for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Tim Mander, was asked if he had a message for Save Victoria Park. “It’s not for me to send a message to protesters. We live in a democracy, and it’s great that people can do that freely and safely, and we respect their opinion, but we are committed to Victoria Park,” he said. “So they can protest. We’ll continue to go progress forward with regards to what needs to be done at Victoria Park.”", "tags": ["brisbane", "olympic", "games", "2032", "queensland", "brisbane", "queensland", "politics", "liberal", "national", "party", "indigenous", "australians", "features"]},

Gabon’s 4-3 win over the Gambia means   have to defeat Kenya at home on Tuesday despite thrashing Seychelles 7-0. Mohamed Salah scored twice as Hossam Hassan’s side beat Djibouti 3-0 on Wednesday in Casablanca and made up for   by reaching the finals with a game in hand. This will be Egypt’s fourth finals, even though they have yet to win a game. Bizarrely, the Pharaohs did qualify for the first World Cup, in 1930, but missed their boat from Marseille to South America  . The undisputed neutrals’ favourites at the last finals became the first African nation to reach the 2026 showpiece with a 5-0 thumping of Niger on 5 September in Rabat. The Qatar 2022 semi-finalists qualified from Group E with two games to spare after Tanzania’s 1-1 draw in Congo-Brazzaville. The Atlas Lions have reached the finals six times and will   alongside Portugal and Spain (the three opening matches will be played in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay). Likewise, the Carthage Eagles qualified with two games to spare in Group H. Mohamed Ben Romdhane’s last-gasp winner and the defiance of the goalkeeper, Aymen Dahmen, in Malabo against Equatorial Guinea ensured Tunisia reached the finals for a seventh time, although they have yet to progress beyond the group stage. Vladimir Petkovic’s side secured their place with a comfortable 3-0 win over Somalia on Thursday. Mohamed Amoura scored twice, taking the Wolfsburg striker’s tally in the qualifying campaign to eight, and the captain, Riyad Mahrez, added another. Victory put them four points clear of second-placed Uganda in Group G with one round of matches remaining. It will be Algeria’s fifth   finals appearance but first since Brazil in 2014. Six of eight nations have qualified directly, with one other place up for grabs via the intercontinental playoffs after a regional playoff in November. Australia reached the finals in June having recovered from a goal down to beat Saudi Arabia in Jeddah. Connor Metcalfe’s first goal for his country just before half-time restored parity, before Mitch Duke’s header from Martin Boyle’s free-kick three minutes into the second half completed the Socceroos’ revival. After failing to beat Bahrain and Indonesia, Australia ended their campaign with wins over Japan and the Saudis to qualify automatically, their sixth World Cup in a row. There was no little drama as Team Melli twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with their Group A rivals Uzbekistan on 25 March thanks to a double from Mehdi Taremi. Iran first reached the finals in 1978 but in six tournaments have yet to venture beyond the group stage. Their finest hour thus far came against the USA in Lyon at the 1998 finals, a 2-1 victory sparking delirium in the streets of Tehran. They met again in Qatar, the group match ending 1-0 in the Americans’ favour after a goal from Christian Pulisic in the 38th minute. The Samurai Blue cruised through their qualifying campaign, sealing their ticket with three group games to spare. Japan became the first nation to book their place through qualifiers by beating Bahrain 2-0 in Saitama after Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo scored in the second half. They will compete in their eighth successive World Cup. In Qatar, Hajime Moriyasu’s side reached the last 16 only to lose to Croatia on penalties. Ali Olwan’s hat-trick triggered jubilation in Jordan as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up qualified for their first World Cup finals on 5 June after beating Oman 3-0 in Muscat as South Korea beat Iraq 2-0. Jordan’s ruler, King Abdullah II, was pictured wearing a national team jersey as he watched the game from the Jordan embassy in London, where he was on a visit. Korea reached their 11th consecutive finals with victory over 10-man Iraq at Basra Stadium on 5 June for what is expected to be Son Heung-min’s swansong. The Tottenham great and Taegeuk Warriors captain will turn 34 during the finals and has said it will be his last tournament. Korea’s formidable qualifying record is bettered only by Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina and Spain, although their underwhelming exit at the 2023 Asian Cup led to Jürgen Klinsmann being replaced by Hong Myung-bo, who oversaw victories against Oman, Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait in qualifying. Welcome, the White Wolves, who finally reached a World Cup finals some 2,800 miles from home with a drab 0-0 draw with the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi. The Uzbeks are finally making an impact at senior international level, having reached the quarter-finals of the Under-17 World Cup, last 16 of the global Under-20 tournament and the Paris Olympics. In Abdukodir Khusanov, who made his (albeit shaky) Manchester City debut aged just 20, and the 22-year-old winger Abbosbek Fayzullaev, Timur Kapadze has two burgeoning talents at his disposal. A total of 54 nations (Russia are suspended) are slugging it out for a place at next year’s finals. The winners of 12 groups qualify, while the four remaining places are secured via a playoff system featuring group runners-up and Nations League group winners. There are three automatic slots for the winners of the three four-team groups. The two best runners-up progress to the intercontinental playoffs. One automatic place has been secured.  , a French overseas territory not recognised by Fifa until 2004, will play in March’s intercontinental playoffs. In a land where rugby union is a sporting religion, any success by the All Whites is to be savoured. New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time in 16 years by beating New Caledonia 3-0 at Auckland’s Eden Park, the fortress of their 15-player code cousins the All Blacks. The win didn’t come easy, however. Goalless in the first half, Darren Bazeley’s side lost their captain, Chris Wood, to a hip injury early in the second. Only after an hour did Michael Boxall end the stalemate, scoring his first international goal aged 36. Kosta Barbarouses doubled New Zealand’s lead shortly after, before Eli Just wrapped up the result in the 80th minute. The six direct spots have all been all filled.   secured the confederation’s playoff place with a surprise 1-0 win over Brazil in El Alto.   \n The holders claimed their spot on 25 March when Bolivia drew 0-0 with Uruguay. The big question hovering over Lionel Scaloni’s world champions is whether Lionel Messi will play at the finals. The Inter Miami forward has remained coy about his intentions. “Well, it’s like I’ve said before. I don’t think I’ll play the next World Cup – not because of age, but the most logical thing is that I won’t,” said Messi after helping Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 last month. The evergreen 38-year-old then backtracked slightly, adding: “It’s about taking it one day at a time, trying to feel good, and above all being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it. When I don’t, honestly, I suffer, and I’d rather not be there. So we’ll see.”  reached the finals – for the fifth time this century – on 10 June, a goalless draw against Peru in Lima enough to assure Ecuador’s place with two matches to spare. Ecuador, who finished second in the standings, beat the team who finished top, Argentina, 1-0 in Guayaquil in a match that ended with both sides reduced to 10 players by red cards. Argentina’s Nicolás Otamendi was sent off in the 31st minute and the hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage when Enner Valencia scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Ecuador were also reduced to 10 men when the Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo was dismissed in the 50th minute. Colombia are a colourful feature of any finals and, after missing out on Qatar 2022, are back after James Rodríguez led his side to a 3-0 defeat of Bolivia on 4 September, Néstor Lorenzo’s side reaching the 2026 tournament with a game to spare.   progressed to the quarter-finals in 2014 and in Luis Díaz boast one of the game’s most compelling talents. The winger scored 30 goals in his last two seasons at Liverpool, helping them win the Premier League, and has been in scintillating form since a summer move to Bayern Munich. One to watch: Benfica’s record signing, Richard Ríos. The 25-year-old has made a dazzling start to life at the Estádio da Luz after his move from Palmeiras. Marcelo Bielsa, once the toast of Elland Road, guided   to their fifth successive World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory against Peru at the Estadio Centenario on 4 September. In a mixed campaign Uruguay still managed to beat Brazil in Montevideo and surprise Argentina in Buenos Aires. The 70-year-old former Leeds manager is set for a third World Cup as a head coach. In 2002,  ’s Argentina side crashed out in the group stage but he led Chile to South Africa 2010 where they were beaten in the last 16 by Brazil. Bielsa has talent at his disposal, too. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez may have gone, but the Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde brings the fire. His club manager, Xabi Alonso, has compared him with a peak Steven Gerrard, saying: “Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”  Carlo Ancelotti’s side extended Brazil’s record as the only team to play at every World Cup by beating Paraguay 1-0 on 10 June to finish fifth in the standings, their lowest qualifying position. The five-time winners will make their 23rd appearance in next year’s tournament but, with limited preparation time after arriving in May from Real Madrid, the Italian coach is relying on team spirit and individual talent. “I think more tactical work is needed to refine game strategy. All of this can be very important, but the most important part is not the strategy, it is the attitude of the players on the pitch. For that, it doesn’t take much time to prepare,” says Ancelotti. For the first time since 2010 Paraguay will participate in the World Cup after a tricky 0-0 draw at home against Ecuador on 4 September. Gustavo Alfaro’s side impressed by holding off their opponents to snare the crucial point they needed. Miguel Almirón, who left Newcastle in January, and the former Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso, now at Strasbourg, are two players familiar to Premier League adherents. Almirón was 16 years old in 2010 and the Atlanta United captain still recalls watching Paraguay’s first match – a 1-1 draw with Italy in Cape Town – with his friends at his home in the San Pablo neighbourhood of Asunción. “That fills you with pride, to see your country in this huge competition,” Almirón said. “You always dream of that.”", "tags": ["world", "cup", "2026", "world", "cup", "2026", "qualifiers", "world", "cup", "us", "sports", "explainers"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/11/australia-usmnt-mls-patrick-yazbek-nashville-sc", "content": "here is perhaps no greater reminder that   is a faraway island nation with limited global influence than the fact so many Australians pore over a niche form of online football content known as ‘Aussies Abroad’. While the likes of Ned Zelic and Paul Okon were hardly the first Australian players to move to Europe, their arrivals at Borussia Dortmund and Club Brugge in the early 1990s coincided with a surge of interest in how Aussie footballers were performing overseas. By the time Mark Viduka and Harry Kewell lit up the Premier League with Leeds United almost a decade later, Australian fans were well versed in keeping tabs on Aussies abroad. So, it’s no surprise to see the online lists of Aussies plying their trade in Major League Soccer eagerly updated every time there’s another transfer. What is perhaps more surprising is that more Australian football fans aren’t tuning into the league on Apple TV. “I feel like there needs to be a bit more exposure to Major League Soccer in Australia,” Socceroos and Nashville SC midfielder Patrick Yazbek said. “I still feel like a lot of Aussies have this misconception that the only alternative to watching the A-League is watching European football.” It’s a perception Yazbek is keen to change, not least because many games kick off at an ideal time for viewers in Australia. In a country where the average Uefa Champions League game kicks off at 4.30am, most Saturday night   games start at the far more palatable hour of 9.30am on a Sunday morning. “What more do you want than to sit down with a coffee and watch a game?” Yazbek said. Yazbek is one of a growing number of Aussies who have used a move to North America to help bolster their national team ambitions. Of the 25 players called into the squad for this month’s clashes with World Cup hosts Canada and the  , three – Yazbek, DC United defender Kye Rowles and New York City FC midfielder Aiden O’Neill – play their club football in MLS. A fourth, defender Miloš Degenek – who recently captained the Socceroos against New Zealand in Canberra – was once a mainstay at Columbus Crew. Yazbek, who started his professional career with Sydney FC in Australia’s domestic A-League, trod a well-worn path to Europe when he joined Norwegian club Viking in 2023. But it was his next move that raised plenty of eyebrows in Australia, with the Sydney-born midfielder swapping the cold of Stavanger for the relative unknown of Nashville. It’s a move that has paid off for the box-to-box midfielder, with Yazbek featuring in both games for the Socceroos against New Zealand in September. He admits it was a conscious decision to move to a high-quality league where his performances were more likely to be noticed. “I honestly think MLS is on track to becoming one of the best leagues in the world in a few years,” he said. “I’ve had so many discussions with my peers and teammates and I say to them: ‘I’ve only been here 12 months and I’ve already seen so much growth’”. In a league bristling with names like Lionel Messi, Son Heung-Min, Thomas Müller, Miguel Almirón and Emil Forsberg, it’s probably safe to assume it’s only Australian fans interested in how the likes of Archie Goodwin, Giuseppe Bovalina and Lucas Herrington are faring on the other side of the world. But while MLS has proved a viable launching ground for full national team honours – Goodwin, Bovalina, and Herrington are all Australia youth internationals – it has also succeeded in ways Australia’s domestic A-League has struggled to replicate. One such area is full-time coaching roles – a domain Chris Sharpe knows well. A goalkeeper by trade, Sharpe ended his playing days in Colorado in 2012 after stints in England, Denmark and his native Australia. Now in his 18th season with the club, he’s spent the past decade helping to shape the careers of a number of high-profile shot-stoppers in his role as the Rapids’ long-serving Assistant and Goalkeeper Coach. “I think it’s very uncommon in the world of football,” Sharpe said of his unusually long tenure with the Rapids. “It’s probably a bit more common with goalkeepers and goalkeeper coaches though – especially if goalkeepers are on long-term deals – because there’s a bit of a special bond between a goalkeeper and goalkeeper coach.” It’s a bond that has seen Sharpe oversee the likes of USA national team goalkeepers Tim Howard, William Yarbrough and Zack Steffen. Howard, who remains the most capped goalkeeper in US men’s national team history, even asked Sharpe to introduce him on stage when the latter was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2024. Sign up to  Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer after newsletter promotion Sharpe admits he’ll have mixed emotions when the Socceroos run out to face the USA at in Colorado Dick’s Sporting Goods Park on 14 October, but the Sydney-born coach says he is grateful for the opportunities his adopted homeland has provided. “Having been here for so long, I’ve kind of built my life and my career here,” he said. “The US has given me opportunities that I might not have had otherwise, so I’m really grateful for that.” Adam Waterson is another Australian who traded the comforts of Down Under for a life in Major League Soccer. The long-serving Head of Strength and Conditioning at Los Angeles Galaxy joined the club just two months before the arrival of Zlatan Ibrahimović, but says young Aussie players are now just as likely to attract the attention of MLS scouts. “Honestly, you’re in the shop window,” Waterson said of the league’s subtly shifting transfer strategy. “There are clubs all around the world now that are looking at MLS as a bit of a development league.” After finishing second to cross-town rivals Los Angeles FC in the Western Conference in 2024, Galaxy went on to win MLS Cup with a 2-1 victory over New York Red Bulls. Despite the presence of high-profile former internationals like Maya Yoshida and Marco Reus, it was the contributions of Joseph Paintsil, Gabriel Pec and Dejan Joveljić – who went on to join Sporting Kansas City for $4 million in the league’s first cash-for-player trade – that proved decisive. Galaxy paid around $19 million in transfer fees to acquire the relatively unheralded Pec and Paintsil, but as Waterson points out: “they won us a championship.” And with clubs across the league utilizing a mix of high-profile recruits and raw young talent, it’s a model that could see MLS clubs continue to sign the best young Aussies, develop them, then move them on for even higher transfer fees. “In the past, we spent money on players like Zlatan, Robbie Keane, Ashley Cole and Steven Gerrard,” Waterson said. “Now we’re moving away from that model a little bit, which could be great for young Aussie kids.” With MLS currently home to eight Australian players – along with a trio of New Zealand internationals in Michael Boxall, Finn Surman and Bill Tuiloma – it’s hard to imagine we’ve seen the last of the arrivals from Down Under. Having recently   with Nashville and with a World Cup on the horizon, Yazbek admits a shared language – and the ability to adapt to the physical demands of the league – have helped catapult him into the national team spotlight. “This is the first real year where I’ve played probably almost 40 games and it’s been really good,” he said. “I’ve been involved in a winning team, which is important, too.” While Australia coach Tony Popović can afford to experiment now that his Socceroos side has booked its spot at next year’s World Cup finals, he’s generally shown a preference to those playing regularly for their club sides. That should hold Yazbek – who played 80 minutes of the recent US Open Cup final win over Austin FC – in good stead. “Before coming to Nashville, it was certainly a consideration,” he said. “It was a question of: ‘will this facilitate my national team ambitions?’” Now, having thrust himself into the national team limelight, he’s in a good spott to book himself a spot on the plane to a World Cup played in a region he knows well. “In coming to MLS, I did feel like I was taking a bit of a leap because I was one of the first young Australian players to move here,” he said. “But I feel like having taken the leap and trusting that playing in this league regularly would help me, I think it has all worked out really well.”", "tags": ["australia", "usa", "mls", "us", "sports", "australia", "sport", "features"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/10/stephen-miller-trump-administration", "content": "n an interview on Monday,   Boris Sanchez asked Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, whether   intended to   by federal judge Karin Immergut’s order blocking the deployment of the national guard in Oregon. Miller said neither yes nor no. But the implication was no. The   had already filed an appeal with the ninth circuit. He said: “I would note the administration won an identical case in the ninth circuit just a few months ago with respect to the federalizing of the California national guard.” Actually, it didn’t quite win. As I understand it (and lawyers, please correct me) the administration won a temporary stay on a temporary injunction against federalizing the California national guard in Los Angeles. Then Miller continued: “Under Title 10 of the US Code, the president has plenary authority, has–” There he abruptly stopped. The man whose entire head looks as if it’s covered by a stocking mask seemed to betray a feeling. Maybe regret, maybe embarrassment. Maybe:  Miller blinked several times. Sanchez called his name and asked if he could hear him. Miller did not respond. Then Sanchez apologized for technical difficulties and cut to a commercial break. When the interview came back on the air, the words   were not uttered. The clip CNN posted to the internet deleted  , but it was widely posted and viewed anyway. Plenary authority, or plenary power, means absolute, unlimited, and unchecked power. The power of a king. The power of Caesar, of Hitler, of Stalin. , which covers the structure and laws of the military, refers little to the president, and most of that is about appointing secretaries and submitting a budget to Congress. There’s nothing in the code that remotely suggests absolute presidential power. The constitution gives the president only one unchecked power: the power of the pardon. Even the  , under which a president can impose martial law and overstep other laws and judicial orders, is restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Or so some commentators, sunnier than I, have reassured. In short, the executive branch is supposed to be checked and balanced by the other two branches of government. That the other two branches of government don’t feel like checking or balancing at the moment does not give the president absolute power. The meticulously lawyerly way in which Miller lied about the US Code is complemented by the vague, all-encompassing apocalyptic rhetoric with which he is preparing Maga for war against the domestic enemy. “We are the storm,” he thundered at   funeral, in a   some listeners have   to one the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels gave at a 1932 campaign rally. “Our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion. Our lineage and our legacy hails back to Athens, to Rome, to Philadelphia, to Monticello. Our ancestors built the cities. They produced the art and architecture. They built the industry,” he continued. “We stand for what is good, what is virtuous, and what is noble.” And who are “our enemies”? They are both mighty – “the forces of darkness and evil” – and puny. Turning his address to “you”, the enemy, he went on: “You are nothing. You have nothing. You are wickedness, you are jealousy, you are envy, you are hatred. You are nothing! You can build nothing, you can produce nothing. You can create nothing. “You have no idea the dragon you have awakened. You have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilization. To save the west, to save this republic.” Miller referred to the future generations of “our children” and to the nothingness to which “you” will eventually come. Or rather, be delivered. As   and emotionally labile, Miller grows more and more influential. He is the president’s brain, his discipline. Where Trump has no guiding principles, Miller is a resolute ideologue of white, western supremacy and a tactician of final solutions. Trump is easily lampooned, but Miller is the grimmest of reapers. Timothy Snyder, the historian and author of the influential book On Tyranny, posted a   on his Substack, comparing Miller to Stalin. One thing he said is that Stalin gained power as Lenin’s health failed. Lenin’s leadership ran from 1917 to 1924, but he was incapacitated by strokes beginning in 1922. Stalin’s murderous reign lasted until 1953. In Stephen Miller, we see that Maga will not simply end with Trump. We must keep our eyes on him, contest everything he does and says. Because – while this may be hard to fathom – if the US ends up with Miller as its dictator, we are in even deeper trouble than we are with Trump, and it could last a lot longer.

So, too, have the   who thought they might never see their loved ones again. We can only share in their relief. And still, the reasons to be wary of the ceasefire’s long-term prospects are endless. We have been here before. I’m haunted by   from back in January, in which 28-year-old Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif removes his press vest and helmet live on air before being hoisted aloft by a joyous crowd as he announces news of a ceasefire. That deal led to several successful exchanges of Israeli and Palestinian captives and brought two months of relative respite to Gaza – before Israel tore up the agreement by launching more than 100 airstrikes on the besieged territory in one night,  . Five months later, Israel bombed a press tent outside a Gaza City hospital, killing Sharif and  . A bad deal is better than no deal (and with Donald Trump and Tony Blair at the helm of Gaza’s future, this is  ), but what is especially concerning is the shift in official discourse that suggests we may not even get that far. According to Trump’s   on Wednesday night, what the parties have agreed to is, in fact, only “the first phase” – a term that does not appear anywhere in the  , and is more reminiscent of the January deal which Israel moulded to facilitate a resumption of the war after a few dozen hostages were released. This linguistic bait-and-switch was not arbitrary. As the journalist Amit Segal, considered one of Benjamin Netanyahu’s mouthpieces in the Israeli media,   on Thursday morning: “There’s no phase two. That’s clear to everyone, right? Phase two might happen someday, but it’s unrelated to what’s just been signed. The deal signed now is a hostage release deal. It doesn’t imply anything about the future.” So should we take from this that Netanyahu is already planning to resume the war after the remaining hostages have been released, as he did last time? That is certainly one reading. But longtime observers of the Israeli prime minister will know that what has kept him at the top for so many years is his ability to spin multiple plates at once, juggling them as he works out which one will best serve his personal and political agenda at any given moment. And right now, his calculations appear to have shifted. To understand Netanyahu, you need to understand what influences his decision-making. The first major factor is his ongoing trial in an Israeli court after his 2019 indictment for bribery, fraud and breach of trust – charges that carry significant prison time. Since then, Netanyahu has been more determined than ever to retain the position of prime minister in order to drag out the trial and fend off the charges. This is what led him to throw his political weight behind   ahead of the 2022 election in order to safeguard his return to the premiership, and it has been a key driver of his   against the independence of Israel’s judicial system. The second factor is the reason he got into politics in the first place: to thwart any meaningful progress toward the establishment of a Palestinian state. From driving a spear through the remnants of the Oslo peace process upon first taking power in the 1990s, to paying lip service to subsequent US peace initiatives while legislating piecemeal annexation of the occupied West Bank, Netanyahu has made it his life’s mission to ensure that no Palestinian state can ever come to exist between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Since 7 October, these motivations have fused to devastating effect. After the deadliest attack on Israelis in the country’s history, Netanyahu’s approval rating slumped to an all-time low. His desperation to cling to power led him to dive head-first into a genocidal war with no clear aims in the hope that it would keep his government together long enough for him to restore some semblance of his prior prestige. This meant   at almost every turn, and cutting short the deal he signed last January when it suited him. Having long pioneered a policy of “managing the conflict” in order to keep the Palestinians subdued, Netanyahu soon began spinning a different plate. Enticed by the prospect of  from the demographic equation once and for all, and emboldened by Trump’s own sudden fascination with a “Gaza Riviera”, the Israeli prime minister embraced the   of the extreme right. He pursued     in an effort to ethnically cleanse the territory of Palestinians, but ultimately ran up against a   and a lack of interest around the world in absorbing hundreds of thousands of starving refugees. Netanyahu has decided to shift gears once again and sign the new ceasefire deal. His efforts to empty Gaza of Palestinians  . Israel is becoming a global pariah, with all the economic and cultural burdens that entails. His approval rating isn’t getting any higher – despite all of the military achievements he   at last month’s UN general assembly – and there is an election on the horizon. Now, it seems, he believes he has more to gain from   in Gaza to launch his re-election campaign than from continuing the war. If he loses the messianic wing of his coalition, whose leaders   to quit the government in response to the ceasefire, so be it; he’ll reach across the aisle in the name of “national responsibility” and find old-new partners. Photo ops with returning Israeli hostages and a triumphant Trump, who is set to visit Israel in the coming days, will do that campaign no harm. Nor would steps toward additional normalisation agreements which a ceasefire might make possible, perhaps with Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, or even Syria. As a result of his own calculations and a little more pressure from the White House than he is used to, Netanyahu is leaning into the deal,   and stroking Trump’s ego – most recently by   an AI-generated image in which he is placing a giant “Nobel peace prize” medal around the president’s neck in front of an adoring crowd. Sign up to  Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more after newsletter promotion Yet by splitting the implementation of the ceasefire into phases, the Israeli prime minister is once again giving himself the option of sabotaging it if he changes his mind. Certainly, he has no intention whatsoever of paving “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”, as the agreement stipulates. The rest of the international community, which has either stood by or given its backing for two years as Israel pulverised  , simply cannot allow Netanyahu to subvert another deal, and should be intervening already to ensure that any deviation will be met with diplomatic might. Nor can the international community take its foot off the gas as Israel inevitably shifts its focus to the West Bank, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forcibly displaced over the past two years. Recognition of Palestinian statehood means nothing as long as Israel is allowed to   with impunity. The annihilatory fervour that has taken hold among a large segment of Israeli society will not dissipate overnight, which is why the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem has   that the genocide could just as easily pivot to the West Bank. And even if the ceasefire holds, there can be no going back to an illusory pre-7 October “business as usual”. Crimes against humanity demand accountability and justice, most of all for those who didn’t live to see them end. Gaza must be rebuilt, and Palestinians must be freed from Israel’s stranglehold.

And yet, in four recent   on the antichrist in San Francisco, the billionaire venture capitalist has made a good case for credentialing. In these meandering talks, Thiel is clearly aiming for the kind of syncretic thinking he so relished in the books and lectures of the philosopher and professor René Girard, whom he knew at Stanford University and whose work he has long admired. Unfortunately, more often than not, Thiel ends up with something that reads like Dan Brown. Thiel has previously workshopped his talks on Armageddon at Oxford and Harvard, at various theology departments, and with a few unfortunate podcasters. For a man so vocal in his disdain of our institutions of higher education, he seems to spend an awful lot of time in them. Overall, the picture of Thiel that emerges in these lectures is someone desperately trying to disidentify from their own power. “You realize,” he tells his audience when interpreting a particular Japanese manga, “in my interpretation … who runs the world is something like the antichrist.” Here’s a man who, together with a couple of fellow Silicon Valley freaks,   a sundowning caudillo to a presidency he is obviously unsuited for, and who uses the awesome might of the US government to remake society and the world. A man who funds the companies that harness your data and determine who gets doxed, deported, drone struck. Who   that seek to remake the very face of liberal democracy. To be fair, Thiel has blazed a successful path outside of the ivory tower. Ungodly rich by age 30, the founder and investor has since spread the gospel of not going to college. He believes that higher education is a bubble. In his first book, co-authored with his Sancho Panza, David Sacks, he attacked US universities as bastions of diversity group-think, with slipping standards. He has evidently stuck to this diagnosis, even though admissions rates, scholarly output and Nobel prize recognition would seem to contradict it. To Thiel, even then, Jerusalem was definitely not build’d here, among these dark Satanic diploma mills. In September, Falter in Austria published a long profile about the theologian Wolfgang Palaver, who is one of those academics Thiel used as beta testers on his antichrist material. Palaver says it makes sense to him that Thiel is seeking out academics: “It’s really difficult in his environment: who tells him the truth to his face?” There is something deeply funny imagining a rapt audience, cowed by Thiel’s legend and wealth, following the billionaire into the autodidact’s private cosmos, in lectures whose bullet points were certainly more robust at the start of lecture one than at the close of lecture three. Thiel is lost in a bizarre thicket of his own references and preoccupations. You picture the theological faculty at the University of Innsbruck sitting politely through disquisitions about the manga One Piece, Alan Moore’s Watchmen, or gripes with specific effective altruists in Silicon Valley. In one lecture, Thiel identifies “the legionnaires of the antichrist”, such as the researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky and former Oxford professor Nick Bostrom. In another, he considers Bill Gates as an antichrist candidate. With enemies like these, who needs friends? But such is Thiel’s odd relationship to academia. For someone who dislikes universities and researchers, he has a hard time staying away. Thiel, who received a bachelor’s degree from Stanford in 1989 and a JD from Stanford Law School in 1992, was deeply impressed with the thinking of Girard, his Stanford professor. He has spent decades promoting Girard’s “ ”, including attributing his famous investment in Facebook to “betting on mimesis”. His current “Whore of Babylon” tour started with a presentation at a Paris conference devoted to Girard’s work. Thiel clearly admired Girard not just for his arguments but for his style of argumentation. These lectures don’t so much feel inspired by Girard’s ideas. They feel like his attempt to do Girard. Girard’s books were breathtaking in their range. They were deeply eclectic, but managed to be a mad dash through the western canon. The connections the philosopher made could seem to come out of left field, but at times the absurd swerves were held together by the sheer force of his erudition. Most importantly, Girard was always having a conversation all his own: his work could look like theology, but it wasn’t ultimately that religious; his work could look like philosophy, but wasn’t really in dialogue with academic philosophy. In San Francisco, Thiel appeared to be cosplaying this kind of performance. One of the things he replicates is the airtight and airless insularity of Girard’s thought. Thiel seems to take on board objections only to then barrel ahead with his initial instinct. Palaver is quoted in Falter as saying that he is “no longer the professor, and he’s no longer the graduate student”. It’s a funny remark because watching Thiel take feedback makes him seem exactly like a graduate student about to crash out of his comprehensive exam. In his telling, Thiel is already a part of an intellectual community. He loves telling his audience what he “always” says, he refers to standard answers and even a “spiel” that he gives. He seems a little bored with himself. Based at least on the recording, the actual audience in San Francisco seemed puzzled by Thiel’s disquisitions. Like his inspiration Girard, Thiel is prone to speaking in absolutes that, in order to make any sense at all, have to be quite a bit less than absolute. “In all times and all places, people want to always scapegoat the Christian God for our problems,” he said in his second lecture. Big if true, as they say. What is Thiel actually arguing? He suggests that we live in an age obsessed with apocalyptic thinking (keep that “we” in mind, it’ll become important later). “It’s AI, of course, it’s climate change, bioweapons, nuclear war,” “maybe fertility collapse”, he says. His overall point is that the current fixation on the apocalypse gets it wrong in two different directions: we’re too apocalyptic and “not apocalyptic enough”. Not apocalyptic enough because we tend to think of the various plausibly forecast ends of days as mutually exclusive: either climate change will get us, or nuclear war. The antichrist is Thiel’s attempt to think about the end of the world holistically. But we’re also too apocalyptic: in each lecture, Thiel comes back to the idea that “the Antichrist will come to power by talking about Armageddon nonstop.” Or, as he puts it in the second lecture, “the Antichrist might present himself or itself or herself as the Katechon”, meaning that withholding element that forestalls the apocalypse. This lecture is more or less a gloss on Carl Schmitt’s assertion in Nomos of the Earth, that the Katechon was what allowed for the identification of   with the Roman empire. The doubleness of Thiel’s apocalypse – that what halts the apocalypse might in fact bring about the apocalypse – allows the billionaire to tilt boldly at any number of big questions: empire, Christianity, progress, and Silicon Valley’s dominance. Each of these, to Thiel, is ambiguous, might stymie or accelerate Armageddon. So who or what is the antichrist? Thiel is admirably and uncharacteristically specific on this matter in a scattershot sort of way. The antichrist wants to erect a one-world state, which largely seems to mean any kind of global regulatory regime. Longtime Thiel watchers will recall his preoccupation with   and  . The antichrist appears to be any force opposing that. The antichrist also is people who are against AI, especially those who seek to regulate it. If you were hoping for Al Pacino chewing scenery, this might be a bit of a letdown. It does lead, however, to the insight that the antichrist is “someone like Greta”, as in Thunberg, the climate activist, but “not Andreessen”, as in Marc, the venture capitalist. “I think Andreessen is not the antichrist. Because, you know, the antichrist is popular.” Respect where it’s due: that is a good line. But let me return to Thiel’s list of possible apocalypses: artificial intelligence, climate change, bioweapons, nuclear war, fertility collapse. The list is unintentionally revealing. Thiel is probably not wrong to say that people are pretty worried about the climate crisis. But the examples of AI, bioweapons and fertility collapse in particular suggest that Thiel has confused the world’s worries for those of a very recherché set of aging tech entrepreneurs he hobnobs with. And the antichrist, too, seems very Silicon Valley-coded. This suggests, I think, that in Thiel’s mind there are two cosmic forces warring over creation itself, and they both consist of Peter and his friends. Thiel thinks that by both increasing knowledge and particularizing knowledge, modernity has made thinking of the totality more difficult. He has observed there is “this sort of incredible fragmentation of knowledge”. We do more science than ever but without true insight. In the “post-modern multiversity”, “science continues to grow like a colony of rabbits”, but since the inputs, in terms of people, degrees awarded, investment, etc, keep increasing, “you have to suspect that there are diminishing returns,” he says. So for those playing along at home: Thiel is both a “classical liberal” who just thinks in terms of inputs and outputs and wants the university to be as efficient as it can possibly be. And he is a fire-breathing theologian who thinks that the university is failing at its job of considering the totality, venerating at the altar of hyperspecialization and postmodern deathworks. He is the libertarian offended at researchers “stealing money” and “not doing anything”, he says in one lecture. And he is the campus critic he was during his Stanford days, the one who refers to former Harvard University president Claudine Gay as “the DEI person”. How any of that mishmash fits together isn’t as important as why it goes together: it serves as a justification for Thiel’s own autodidactism. It’s important to note that he holds himself to a vastly different standard than just about anyone else: he thinks just raising some questions about the antichrist might be useful in its own right – which may be true for all I know. But then he wants to quantify what everyone else contributes to knowledge in a way I can only describe as Doge-like. It would be difficult to count the monetary value of theorizing about Armageddon, as he is doing while pontificating about the cost-ineffective academic from the other side of his mouth. The rules appear to be different for Thiel, at least in his own mind. And such is Thiel’s odd relationship to power. One is reminded of the scene in Apocalypse Now where Martin Sheen’s character comes across a platoon and asks who’s in charge here. “Ain’t you?” Ain’t you running the world, Peter? If it isn’t you, who is? If we want to look at Thiel as something he can’t seem to see himself as – as, in the end, a pretty standard specimen of homo siliconvalliensis – then what is interesting in these lectures is not the amateurish breadth and ambition. It’s the narrowness. Thiel’s vision of the antichrist may not be holistic enough. In the first lecture, where Thiel proposes that the catastrophes we see in the various end-of-days narratives in the Bible are threatening to play out literally in our day. He says we shouldn’t think of “the apocalyptic prophecies in the Bible … in a mystical way”, but almost as “rational scientific calculations of what people will be able to do to themselves in a world in which human nature is not changed or improved”. But that is surely not what Revelation is about: the end of days in the Bible is in there because it attests to a view of the cosmos, its alpha and omega, its entire meaningful constitution. Otherwise, it is just a bunch of trumpets and locusts and people who give suspiciously good speeches. In the end, it isn’t clear how meaningful these four lectures make the antichrist or indeed the apocalypse. It’s not even clear how they make meaning. During the Q&A after the second lecture, someone in the audience asked Thiel whether he was moving away from his erstwhile teacher Girard – which is the central question, though perhaps not for the reason the questioner thinks. It gets at what Thiel is aiming at with these lectures. Perhaps some of their surface strangeness is explained by the fact that Thiel is ultimately engaging in some kind of Girardian play with doubles, mirrors and imitation. Not least among those would be the fact that the description he gives of the antichrist might also apply to one  . So maybe getting stuck on the details means we are missing the hidden, esoteric meaning within? But in that case, what’s the point of these lectures? As he warns in his third lecture, “excessive esotericism means you don’t really think coherently enough about your ideas; they get lost and you communicate them too subtly”. It feels like Thiel is keeping both options open. He gets to tap dance between “I said what I said” and “you don’t understand what I’m doing here”. He seems to want to stand apart from his own immense power – apart from his own positions, apart from his own attempts to make himself understood – in something like bemused contemplation.", "tags": ["peter", "thiel", "christianity", "religion", "us", "politics", "technology", "sector"]},

On the world’s TV news broadcasts, the screen was split on Thursday: celebrations in Gaza and celebrations in  , the scenes of cheering and clapping mirroring each other, as if to confirm that this was a war the peoples themselves wanted over long ago – and which most never wanted to begin. The images were not unfamiliar. We had seen a version of them in January, when a ceasefire was announced to great jubilation. That held only until mid-March, when Israel broke the agreement and resumed its bombardment of  , an experience that should temper, and caveat, the current hope with the knowledge that things can unravel at any moment. Still, this time, even the region’s most seasoned pessimists concede, the deal looks more durable. So how did it come about and who deserves the credit? Often a breakthrough such as this is the result of both parties shifting their positions, more or less equally. At first glance, it can seem as if that is what happened here. Hamas was clearly weakened, with Israel having eliminated its leaders and diminished its great patron, Iran. And Donald Trump ensured that those states with leverage over Hamas – Qatar, Turkey and Egypt – pushed the organisation to say yes. (He did that using tools uniquely held by the US, agreeing, for example,   that gives the Gulf state Nato-level protection.) Even so, and despite   of Benjamin Netanyahu’s advocates to suggest otherwise, Hamas was not forced to make a major shift in its stance. Trump’s 20-point plan might call for the group to hand over its weapons, but Hamas has made no commitment on that and there is no mention of it in the current, fairly narrow ceasefire agreement billed as the first phase of the deal. From the start, the group said it would hand over the hostages it held once Israel agreed to release Palestinian prisoners, eventually withdraw its forces from Gaza and end the war. Sure, the withdrawal will be done in stages, but those three moves are what Israel has broadly agreed to. As  , a former colonel in Israeli military intelligence widely regarded as the country’s foremost analyst of Hamas, put it to me when we spoke: “Let’s face it, Hamas didn’t really change anything dramatically in its basic positions.” In other words, the big shift has been in the Israeli stance. Just a few days before Trump unveiled his plan at the White House with Netanyahu at his side, the Israeli prime minister was telling the UN in New York that the war would not end until   was entirely destroyed. Now he has agreed to a deal that leaves Hamas in place. He has accepted what he had previously deemed unacceptable. What got him to do that? The concise answer is that Donald Trump at last wielded the full might of his office and called time on the war. He left Netanyahu in no doubt that his patience had run out, confident that the Israeli PM had nowhere else to turn. Over the past two years, Netanyahu has shown the middle finger to everyone else – including Israel’s historic friends and allies – leaving him dependent on Trump alone. If the US president said the war had to end, it had to end. As Trump himself told Netanyahu: “ .” Most observers suspect that Trump decided to put his foot down after Israel’s 9 September failed attack on the Hamas negotiating team in Doha. Trump took that as a personal affront. Not only did Netanyahu give him insufficient warning that Israel was planning to kill the very people with whom it needed to discuss an agreement, he did it on the sovereign territory of a country with which Trump has personal and financial ties: recall that the Qataris had gifted Trump a new plane to use as Air Force One. It was an act of hubris by Netanyahu. And, like a mafia don insulted by an attempted hit on one of his business associates, Trump decided it was time to remind the Israeli PM who was boss. The US president also noted the loud protests on Israeli streets, as the public there demanded an end to the war, and the global outrage caused by Israel’s shattering of Gaza, and calculated that brokering a ceasefire deal would bring him the kudos that, though he often affects to disdain international opinion, he craves. To say nothing of the Nobel peace prize, which he covets as the one priceless bauble that has so far eluded him. Such is the power of a US president that, once he decided to use it, the pieces swiftly fell into place. Does that, then, make   the hero of this hour? Those of us who have opposed him with such vehemence this past decade should swallow hard and give credit where it is due. His willingness to bully and twist arms, his command of global attention, his force of personality were all deployed, on this occasion, towards a noble goal: to stop the killing and to free the hostages. But any admiration has to be qualified by a single, hard fact. Trump could have done this so much earlier. When he returned to the White House on 20 January, a ceasefire deal not too different from this one was in place. When Netanyahu moved to break that ceasefire in March, Trump could have slammed his foot down then and said no. Instead, he gave him a green light – and what followed was, in many ways, the worst six months of the war. Trump had the power to stop it – and he chose not to. Of course, this same critique applies in spades to Netanyahu himself. Indeed, the offence is worse because a deal broadly similar to the one he agreed this week was on offer as early as June 2024. But he refused it, and others like it that followed, deciding at each turn that his personal and political interests were best served by ongoing war. True, Joe Biden deserves blame for not using US power to demand a halt (though his situation was harder than his successor’s, if only because Donald Trump does not have a Donald Trump in the wings, seemingly promising Netanyahu better terms). But Netanyahu’s culpability runs deep. Sign up to  Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more after newsletter promotion Even if you only go back to the opportunity forsaken in March, just think of all that was lost. The Palestinian lives destroyed in Gaza since then; the hunger as Israel shut off aid. And from Israel’s own point of view: the hostages forced to endure seven months more in captivity; the soldiers killed in action; the demolition of Israel’s standing, especially over aid, turning the country into a global pariah. “It’s really a catastrophe,” says Milstein, “because it seems we made a very long voyage only to find ourselves once again at exactly the same point.” You can pass a similarly damning judgment on Hamas: it could have ended Gaza’s agony so much earlier by releasing all the hostages. As it turns out,   – not this year, at any rate. If he really wants it, it’s clear what he has to do. He has to stay as engaged over the coming months and years as he has been these past 10 days. Every one of his plan’s 20 points contains enough unresolved tensions to bring the entire thing crashing down. Above all, he has to stay on Netanyahu’s case, alert to the danger that Netanyahu will bank what has been agreed and never move on to what is meant to come next. Note the Netanyahu ally who starkly declared: “ .” Trump cannot tolerate that. He has to maintain the pressure, preventing Netanyahu from playing any of his usual games.

The promised panacea never eventuated. Momentum to   has faded even as office vacancies rise and housing shortages intensify. Developers have not submitted a single application to turn an office into housing in central   since 2023. Just one successful application has been made in the CBD of Sydney, the country’s most unaffordable city. Towers have proven expensive to refit and landlords have instead kept their properties in the office market, awaiting either a return of workers or government funding to make conversions stack up. One   found Melbourne had 86 city office blocks ripe for redevelopment and converting just half of those would yield up to 12,000 apartments.   to help facilitate the conversion of the offices. But commercial landlords have been dissuaded by the higher costs of conversion, according to Ingrid Bakker, who led the research as principal at architecture firm Hassell. “In Melbourne, where there are a lot of buildings that are sitting quite empty, we still haven’t really got that sort of traction yet,” Bakker says. The owner of one of the office blocks instead chose to lease to new commercial tenants after Bakker’s team found a refit of one of the 86 would barely break even for a developer, with an estimated profit margin of 0.05%. “There aren’t any developers out there that go: ‘Oh yeah, that fits with my business plan, I want to make point-zero-something per cent profit,’” Bakker says. No applications have been made to create housing in any of the other 80-plus towers, let alone the rest of the city’s 5m sq metres of CBD office space, according to the City of Melbourne. Commercial landlords at the other towers identified in the proposal have instead refurbished the existing offices, continued leasing to business tenants or withdrawn properties from the market. Office vacancy rates have only gone up since 2023, hitting a 30-year high of 15% in July, while just 1.47% of the nation’s rental housing stock is up for lease – a record low. Conversions have been slow to take off compared with other countries,   and United Kingdom, where  . Those reforms have sometimes allowed “slum-like” small flats to be  , without windows and lacking  . Australia has avoided loosening restrictions, meaning conversions remain more costly than starting from scratch, according to University of Technology   professor of sustainable property, Sara Wilkinson. “You might think because you’ve got the foundations, the walls, the roofs, the facades, it could be a fairly economical, fast way to get housing,” Wilkinsons says. “But because of compliance with planning and building codes, it can be quite expensive, and you have to put a lot more … kitchens and bathrooms for each apartment.” The sole successful application for conversion in central Sydney in the last two years is a century-old, eight-storey former warehouse in Ultimo, where the developer is planning to install 156 apartments. One other project is under consideration, a City of Sydney spokesperson says. Some landholders have opted to withdraw their stock from the market and hope   becomes less popular, Wilkinson says. More than 60,000 sq metres of Sydney CBD office space is expected to be retired in the next five years, according to CBRE. Others work to avoiding the obstacles of conversion by demolishing and rebuilding from a blank canvas. Just outside the CBD, a 14-storey building has sat vacant since financial business MLC vacated in 2022. North Sydney council opposed plans to reuse the tower for a build-to-rent project and the developer, Investa, now plans to build commercial and education facilities. Alex Stuart, director at planning firm Urbis, says office owners have looked at falling commercial rents and turned their mind to apartments, before seeing the cost of an adaptation – costs that have soared even higher as  . “It was an opportunity to fill the gap, but now the construction costs have made it challenging,” he says. There are, however, some success stories, raising hopes that more near-empty offices will eventually be turned into homes. A   tower at 41 George Street is being converted to 1,200-bed student housing, with developers turning the windowless middle of the office floors into gym, study and cafeteria spaces, according to Andrew Purdon, a regional director at CBRE. “Student accommodation drives a lot of revenue through the [smaller dorms’] floor area [and] has an advantage over other forms of residential,” Purdon says. Government support has also helped individual cases get over the line: the City of Melbourne secured state funding to convert one of its warehouses to social housing, while a New South Wales government grant has turned a vacant office building in Penrith in western Sydney into temporary accommodation for young people at risk of homelessness. Like Victoria, the NSW government put the spotlight on vacant offices as a way to boost housing stock in 2023, and NSW’s housing minister, Rose Jackson, says the government is still keen to help owners of empty offices explore housing options. The Victorian government is also still willing to fast-track approvals to convert eligible commercial land into apartments, a spokesperson says. But much more is needed to make projects stack up, according to industry expert Philip Oldfield. “If we want to increase the amount of office-to-residential conversions, we need to incentivise that, provide tax breaks or other mechanisms, to make it more financially viable to savvy developers,” he says. Allowing extra storeys can generate more home sales or rental income streams, with one project in Perth adding four floors to a seven-storey former Telstra office to make room for student dorms and a hostel. Regulating carbon emissions from construction could push developers out of new builds and into conversion, Oldfield says, though tax changes and extra funding would be more direct. In  , where individual renovations can receive thousands in funding, a wave of mini-conversions has started. Five new homes have replaced unused space in small office buildings and shops, while five more are on the way, at a cost of $170,000 so far. The city council and state government have collaborated to fund and fast-track projects, offering up to $75,000 per project plus extra for services and construction. While the current pipeline of 52 projects has focused on small offices and shop-top refits, another 150 properties identified as potential converts and bigger projects are forthcoming, a City of Adelaide spokesperson says. Those dedicated incentives for conversion projects are not on offer elsewhere in Australia, though Melbourne’s lord mayor, Nicholas Reece,   lower council rates, taller building heights and refunds on application fees. With dozens of buildings sitting and waiting for new life, Bakker and her team at Hassell are still talking to state and local governments about potential support for Melbourne projects. She says there’s still hope. “Everyone was very keen on this, and they still are,” Bakker says.", "tags": ["housing", "melbourne", "sydney", "architecture", "renting", "construction", "industry", "business", "features"]},

Britain’s Olympic champion outclassed the field in her signature event, finishing in 1min 56.53sec in only her sixth race this season after missing several months of competition due to injury earlier this year. Her fellow Briton Georgia Hunter Bell, the world silver medallist, took second in 1:58.33 on Friday night before a thronging Icahn Stadium. St Vincent’s Shafiqua Maloney (1:58.57) was third. “I’ve barely raced this season so it was probably less of a struggle for me to go out there and want to give it something,” said Hodgkinson, who claimed a bronze medal at last month’s world championships in Tokyo after her campaign was marred by a hamstring injury. “The atmosphere out there is crazy so it was really, really fun.” The American Brittany Brown, the 200m bronze medallist at last year’s Paris Olympics, surprised herself with the sprint double. Brown surged forward at the halfway mark and hung on through the final metres to win the 100m in 10.99sec, beating her compatriot Jacious Sears by just 0.02, with Kayla White (11.22) third. Brown, returned to the track an hour later, dominating the longer sprint with a personal best 21.89, beating her compatriot Anavia Battle (22.21) and the Ivorian Marie-Josée Ta Lou-Smith (22.65). “I was more shocked at the 100m [win] because that was only my second 100m of the year,” said Brown, who missed several months of training after undergoing laparoscopic surgery in December. “The 200m, it was more like: ‘That’s my baby.’ I was still shocked but it was less of a shock.” The women’s-only event is in its   bringing a party atmosphere to traditional track, with live music and Tiffany & Co crowns replacing traditional winners’ medals. The 23-times tennis major winner Serena Williams, who is married to the Athlos founder Alexis Ohanian, was on hand to present the winners with their crowns, adding A-list lustre to the event. The meet also attracted some of the sport’s biggest names, as Faith Kipyegon, Kenya’s three-time Olympic gold medallist and the world-record holder, stormed to victory in the mile, crossing the finish in 4:17.78. She finished nearly two seconds faster than the Ethiopian Gudaf Tsegay, while the American Nikki Hiltz was third in 4:32.51. In the 100m hurdles, Masai Russell wrested the lead with two barriers to go to win in 12.52, the Olympic champion ending her season on a positive note after a disappointing fourth-place finish last month in Tokyo.

But developers say the policy could lead to a slowdown in development in other, less affluent, parts of Sydney, as companies chase higher returns from more expensive apartments. Of course, more apartments – anywhere –  . But will the Minns government’s plans benefit first home buyers struggling to enter the market? The premier, Chris Minns, has talked about turbo-charging housing construction and lowering prices for young people, so they stop leaving NSW for other states. But in September, there were some depressing statistics. NSW needs an average 7,164 new homes to be completed each month to be on track to deliver the 377,000 homes it has promised by 2029 under the  . But the  , released in September, showed 3,637 dwellings were approved in NSW in August, down 6% on the previous month. It followed a 10% fall in July. The declines are concerning because approvals are the pipeline for tomorrow’s housing supply. And things are expected to worsen before they get better. It takes time to build houses, and even more time to construct a block of units, let alone a planned community. For example, the   in the inner south suburb of Waterloo, will deliver 373 apartments in six new high-rise apartment blocks of six to 20 floors. The site was sold by Sydney Water in 2014, the development application was lodged in 2021, final approval came in 2024, with construction starting this year. It’s due to be completed in 2028. So what’s going wrong after three years of Labor vowing to remove development roadblocks? The construction and development industry says streamlining regulation is important, but its problems extend beyond red tape. It’s about the cost of building materials and razor-thin returns. It can be hard to make the maths work, particularly in Sydney, they say. The Property Council of Australia’s NSW executive director, Katie Stevenson, says the state government’s recently announced – but not yet passed –   will make a big difference. “The bill tackles the very issues holding up housing delivery – from clearing the backlog of simpler projects to unblocking complex projects that can deliver hundreds of homes and jobs,” she says. For big projects, there are several important changes, including a proposed Development Co-ordination Authority – essentially a one-stop shop – to centralise and speed up approvals from other agencies, including Sydney Water and the Rural Fire Service. The government has also formalised the   Delivery Authority, which is a fast-track for major housing projects costing more than $60m. Despite some ministers occasionally implying that it has “approved” 187 major residential proposals, the three-person panel acts as a gateway to the fast-track for so-called state-significant projects. The NSW planning department then aims to approve within 275 days. The cost of holding land while waiting for approval is significant, so this could make a real difference. NSW has the slowest approval times of any state. But councils are not happy with losing control over who approves large residential developments, particularly given they are responsible for supporting services, such as roads, parks and libraries. Councils claim they have been unfairly blamed for delays in getting projects out of the ground. Michael Edgar, the general manager of The Hills Shire Council, says there are 17,000 apartments and homes approved by his council that are not yet built. “I suspect there would be similar numbers in council areas in western Sydney,” he says. “We have also rezoned land for a further 70,000 homes.” The Box Hill residential subdivision was rezoned in 2013 with a target of 16,000 homes. Almost 12,000 homes will be built by the end of 2025, but the new primary and high schools, as well as the town centre, aren’t due to be completed until 2028. Edgar says there are many reasons why developers don’t start building that are out of the control of councils. “Even with a streamlined system, projects won’t move if they don’t stack up financially,” the property council’s Stevenson says. “Construction costs remain more than 30% higher than pre-pandemic, interest rates remain elevated, and labour shortages are pushing timelines and budgets out.” Robert Furolo is the executive manager of corporate communications at Deicorp, one of Sydney’s biggest developers. He says the NSW productivity commissioner identified that the cost to deliver a standard two-bedroom apartment – including financing, land, designs, materials, construction, fees, contributions and taxes – plus a reasonable return on capital was approximately $900,000. “Developers need to find suburbs where the market can pay at least this much … to make projects feasible,” Furolo says. “The cost to construct an apartment in Sydney is the same whether you are building in a suburb where you can sell it for $1.5m or $750,000. Unfortunately, with delivery costs still so high, projects are viable only in areas where the sale price exceeds delivery costs. In today’s market, this excludes large parts of western and south-western Sydney.” A   into housing supply challenges urged the NSW government to relax planning controls in areas where development was most feasible – notably the eastern and northern suburbs close to the CBD. The report found that more infill would lead to a fall in home prices on the urban fringe, “reducing the incentive to hoard or speculate” in outlying areas. The NSW planning minister, Paul Scully, says the Minns government is focused on “restoring housing choice and diversity”. Labor wants to rebalance “housing growth in Sydney towards existing infrastructure and, where there has been big infrastructure investment like the metro, fill a gap in new housing supply that had been left unaddressed for decades”. “The Liberals and Nationals focused all the housing growth in greenfield areas on the fringe of Sydney without a thought to infrastructure,” Scully says. The minister argues policy changes are designed to work together to drive increased supply in every corner of NSW and at every level of the market. Guardian Australia talked to developers who say medium to high-rise development will quickly shift away from Sydney’s fringe and west – where land was cheaper – to wealthier areas that have been opened up as a result of the Tods. “If I can accelerate my revenues because I have great views and a train station and shops, then I will be making a profit,” says CBRE’s senior director of capital markets, Alex Mirzaian. “It really comes down to the three Ss: stations, schools and shops. Without amenity, units don’t sell.” Take, for example, the   on the eastern suburbs line, which the Minns government plans to complete, paving the way for 10,000 new homes over 15 years. Despite requiring the acquisition of multimillion-dollar houses to build apartment blocks, Mirzaian says the area is attractive to developers because it offers the prospect of views, transport, schools – and proximity to the CBD. Another cost often cited by developers is  , which are used to fund upgrades to roads and sewers, along with new libraries and schools, that are required by the increased population. “The NSW government can’t control all the costs preventing housing delivery, but one lever they can pull right now is to limit the impact of property taxes and charges stifling development,” Stevenson says.  for the property council “shows that temporarily suspending new infrastructure charges and faster planning approvals could support the delivery of more than 100,000 additional homes by 2029,” she says. “This research clearly demonstrates government taxes and charges are in some areas adding up to 40% to the cost of construction of new homes.” Of course, someone has to pay for infrastructure and with big budget deficits, it’s unlikely that either the NSW government or councils will want to pick up this multibillion-dollar tab. The NSW government has already moved to try to   through the $1bn  . Under the program, the government promises to buy units off the plan, so a developer can meet its bank requirement to pre-sell a majority of units. In practice, the government hopes it doesn’t actually have to buy the homes and that they will all be sold on the open market. But by using the state’s financial clout, it aims to get projects over the line. The program is now open for expressions of interest and there have been 20 applicants so far. Planners and councils also point to the   of pre-approved, architect-designed plans for townhouses, terraces and mansion houses, as a good step towards cutting costs – and time. The designs can be bought for   (then they’ll cost $1,000) and are quickly approved as complying developments, provided the block is suitable. More than 14,000 plans have been bought so far. Furolo says perhaps it’s time to think outside the box on other construction requirements that add to costs. Deicorp is using off-site construction of bathrooms for apartments where possible, he says. The NSW government is   for some of its social housing projects. Other suggestions include building car parks on the first three or four floors of a building and making it higher, instead of excavating, saving roughly $90,000 per unit. Some developers are pushing for smaller, well-designed units with just one bathroom, down from the current 70 sq metres-minimum currently required for two-bedroom units in NSW. Since coming into office, the Minns government has identified dozens of sites surplus to government needs and has begun selling them off – but usually to the highest bidder. Could this land be used more creatively to drive affordable housing? A spokesperson for the minister for lands, Stephen Kamper, said none of the larger sites, which are being offered via an expression of interest process, have been sold. “When a suitable delivery partner is identified, contract negotiations will ensure the best possible housing outcome for that site,” they said.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-astrazeneca-drug-prices", "content": " announced a deal with the British-based drugmaker AstraZeneca for a “most-favored-nation” drug-pricing model aimed at making prescription medicines more affordable and avoiding the administration’s tariff threats. The company will sell some medicines at a discount to the government’s   health plan in exchange for tariff relief, similar to a drug-pricing pact reached last week with Pfizer. Trump began the Oval Office announcement on Friday evening by boasting that he would have struck the deal sooner, but “we were interrupted by a rigged election”. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, who was in attendance, said that during tough negotiations to reach a deal, Trump and his team of officials had “really kept me up at night”. The deals set a framework the White House will use to try to reach its goal of lowering US prescription medicine prices. The president sent letters to 17 leading drugmakers in July telling them to slash prices. Pfizer and AstraZeneca are the first two companies to reach a deal with the administration. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will charge most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid, while guaranteeing such pricing on newly launched drugs, Trump said. That involves matching the lowest price offered in other developed nations. “For many years, Americans have paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, by far,” Trump said, adding that the new deal may cut prices to “the lowest price anywhere in the world. That’s what we get.” Trump went on to repeat the wildly false claim that the discounted prices for American consumers would reduce the price of prescription drugs by up to 1,000%. As Daniel Dale of CNN  : “Cutting drug prices by more than 100% would mean that Americans would get paid to acquire their medications rather than paying for them.” A health economist, Timothy McBride, told the network Trump’s claims are “just not logical”, since a 500% price reduction would mean that a drug that now costs $100 would be available for free, with consumers given a $400 rebate. The actual deal with AstraZeneca includes cutting prices for the government’s Medicaid health plan for low-income Americans and discounted prices through a “TrumpRx” website, the president said. Pfizer previously agreed to drop prescription drug prices in the Medicaid program for lower-income Americans to what it charges in other developed countries in exchange for relief from tariffs threatened by Trump. More than 70 million people are covered by Medicaid, the state and federal government program for low-income people. Drug spending in that program is dwarfed by that of Medicare, which covers people aged 65 and older or those with disabilities and is not included in Friday’s announcement. The Medicaid program already receives the lowest drug prices in the US, so the additional savings may be modest, said Craig Garthwaite, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “If you look at AstraZeneca’s portfolio, I don’t think there are a bunch of drugs that exist where that’s going to involve them giving a very big discount to Medicaid,” Garthwaite said. Americans currently pay by far the most for prescription medicines, often nearly three times more than in other developed nations, and Trump has been pressuring drugmakers to lower their prices to what patients pay elsewhere or face stiff tariffs. Last month, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on drugmakers, increasing pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to agree to price cuts and shift manufacturing to the US. “The tariffs were a big reason he came here,” Trump said of AstraZeneca’s CEO Soriot. AstraZeneca’s Pfizer‑like deal may spare it tariffs, but will not move the needle on US rising health insurance premiums and out‑of‑pocket drug costs, said Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University. “It’s good for the companies, and has very uncertain if any benefit for Americans struggling with the affordability of prescription drugs,” Conti said.", "tags": ["us", "healthcare", "pharmaceuticals", "industry", "medicaid", "drugs", "us", "politics", "news"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/10/trump-netanyahu-gaza-deal", "content": "fter nearly nine months in office, Donald Trump seems to have had enough of the Israeli prime minister,  , undermining his ambition to establish himself as a global peacemaker. Over the past few weeks, the US president finally decided to use his leverage to force Netanyahu to accept a new ceasefire and stop two years of genocidal war in Gaza. On Thursday, Israel and Hamas  of Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, including an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory. It’s unclear what guarantees the US gave to Hamas and Arab mediators to ensure that Netanyahu would not resume the war after the hostage-prisoner swap – if negotiations on later stages of the deal are stalled. That’s what happened earlier this year, when Netanyahu accepted a truce that took effect in January, but then refused to move into the second phase of negotiations with Hamas, and  after two months. Back in March, Trump was still enamored with his  for the US to take control of Gaza and turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East”, displacing 2 million Palestinians. He showed little interest in  to negotiate with Hamas to extend the ceasefire. But in recent weeks, Trump has become personally invested in ending the Gaza war – and his ego might be the one thing that keeps him engaged in preserving a peace agreement that essentially carries his name. It’s been clear since Trump took office that he’s the only world leader who could effectively pressure Netanyahu to end Israel’s war, which has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and triggered a famine in parts of Gaza. The president has considerable leverage over the Israeli premier:  in American weapons and constant diplomatic support for Israel at the UN security council, including multiple US vetoes of ceasefire resolutions over the past two years. Like his predecessor Joe Biden, who provided Israel with a virtually unlimited supply of weapons after the October 2023 Hamas attack, Trump also refused to use his influence over Netanyahu. That allowed Israel to defy global outrage and isolation, and continue its onslaught. For two years, Netanyahu has repeatedly   and torpedoed potential deals by adding new conditions. He prolonged the war in an evident effort to avoid early parliamentary elections and block an inquiry into his government’s security failures that led to the Hamas attack. His clinging to power also   based on an earlier stint as prime minister. Trump, who has faced his own series of charges and convictions in US courts, expressed empathy for Netanyahu, calling the legal case against the Israeli leader a “ ” that should be thrown out. Last year, the international criminal court  for Netanyahu on charges of using starvation as a method of warfare and other crimes against humanity – and the Trump administration recently retaliated by  against four ICC officials. But Trump appears to have soured on Netanyahu last month, after Israel launched , targeting senior Hamas leaders who were meeting in Doha to consider a ceasefire proposal submitted by Arab and US mediators. The Hamas officials, including the group’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, survived the airstrike on 9 September. But the attack outraged Qatar’s leaders, along with other US allies in the region, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. These three wealthy Gulf petrostates have each spent tens of billions of dollars on US weapons and other military assistance over the past two decades. They also all happen to have ongoing deals with  for branded real estate projects, hotels and golf resorts worth billions of dollars. Two weeks after the attack on Qatar, Trump met with a group of Arab and Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the UN general assembly. The US administration then circulated a 21-point peace plan that emerged from that meeting, which included a ceasefire, a hostage-prisoner swap, a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a transitional government led by an international body. The proposal also envisioned creating a temporary governing board for the territory that would be headed by Trump and would include Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. Trump planned to host Netanyahu at the White House on 29 September, and started pressuring the Israeli leader to prepare for a joint announcement. In the days leading up to that meeting, Netanyahu spent hours negotiating with two Trump confidants who had taken a lead role in drafting the new plan: Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, the president’s longtime friend and Middle East envoy. According to reports in , Netanyahu managed to make significant changes to the plan that Trump had negotiated with Arab and Muslim leaders. The prime minister altered the timing of Israeli troop withdrawals, enabling Israel to temporarily keep its forces in more than half of Gaza’s territory, even after Hamas released all of the Israeli hostages. Netanyahu also won concessions on requirements for Hamas to disarm and Israeli troops being able   inside Gaza until the territory is “properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”. That could mean Israel would keep its forces in a section of Gaza indefinitely. At their White House announcement, Trump and Netanyahu presented the plan as an  to release the hostages and lay down its weapons, or face even more severe Israeli attacks – it was framed more as a surrender than a ceasefire. In a video posted after his meeting with Trump,  that he got everything he wanted out of the US president. “Now the whole world, including the Arab and Muslim world, is pressuring Hamas to accept the terms that we created together with Trump, to bring back all the hostages – the living and the dead – while the IDF stays in the Strip,” Netanyahu said in Hebrew, in a message aimed at a domestic Israeli audience. “Who would have believed it?” Indeed, some Arab officials worried that Hamas , partly because of Netanyahu’s last-minute amendments that reduced Israel’s commitment to fully withdraw from Gaza and to end the war. Hamas, which was facing pressure from two allies, Qatar and Turkey, did not refuse Trump’s deal, but didn’t fully embrace it. On 3 October, the group announced that it accepted some elements of the plan, while downplaying several key provisions, including those requiring it to disarm and give up any future role in governing Gaza. Hamas’s response was a qualified yes that called for more negotiations – and Netanyahu tried to frame it as a . But the president jumped on the Hamas statement and finally pushed Netanyahu into accepting that an agreement was within reach. After Hamas issued its response,  that Trump had a tense call with Netanyahu, in which Trump snapped at the prime minister: “I don’t know why you’re always so fucking negative. This is a win. Take it.” Trump’s willingness to strong-arm Netanyahu was the key to achieving the initial deal that is supposed to lead to the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners in the coming days. The president will need to sustain that pressure on Netanyahu to make sure he doesn’t blow up the ceasefire, as he did in March, and resume Israel’s brutal war.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/11/aja-wilson-goat-aces-sweep-wnba-finals-quadruple-crown", "content": "’ja Wilson’s one-of-one season didn’t end merely with confetti so much as a deeper confirmation. When her Las Vegas Aces   on Friday night to become only the second team in WNBA history to win three titles in a four-year span, the final horn felt less like a climax than a verdict: the best team of the era led by the best player of the era. When the dust settled the 29-year-old from Columbia, South Carolina, had achieved a quadrafecta no player in the NBA or WNBA had ever managed: winning the scoring title, the Most Valuable Player award, Defensive Player of the Year honors and MVP of the finals in the same year. Thanks to Wilson, a team who’d looked like   before slipping from their perch a year ago was back at the mountaintop. But anyone who watched the front half of the season knows this was the least expected of Aces’ three banners. For most of the year Las Vegas didn’t give the appearance of a playoff team let alone a champion. They staggered through injuries and misfires, dropped coin-flip games and wore the tightness of a group playing beneath its standard. If dynasties are supposed to hum, this one coughed and sputtered.  Game 1:   Game 2:   Game 3:   Game 4:  To understand how we got here, flash back to 2 August, when the Aces   by the Minnesota Lynx on national television, the worst loss in franchise history and the ultimate stress test of the culture Becky Hammon has spent four seasons building. Las Vegas were a moribund 14–14 then, six weeks from the finish line and barely in the postseason frame. Wilson walked out of Michelob Ultra Arena replaying the wreckage, drafting and redrafting a message she knew had to cut through without burning down what morale remained. She workshopped it with her partner Bam Adebayo, the two-time Olympic gold medallist and Miami Heat captain and then hit send to the team chat:  The next day, Vegas routed Golden State and never lost again in the regular season, ripping off 16 straight wins to nail down the No 2 seed while Wilson sprinted past history  . Hammon matched the tone with a structural tweak that mattered: players would build and present their own scouting reports before coaches weighed in. Accountability stopped being a slogan and became the operating system. “A’ja comes in with a laptop,” Hammon told ESPN. “They’ll kick the coaches out and do their thing.” Only then does the image that will live on come into focus – two nights before the sweep, before a sold-out Phoenix crowd of 17,071 at full boil – Wilson rising, spinning and feathering home an eight-footer with 0.3 seconds left in Game 3 as DeWanna Bonner and Alyssa Thomas crowded her airspace. That shot – thought to be   in basketball history – didn’t just win a game. It effectively sealed the Aces’ place in WNBA lore. The sweep will be the headline, but the spine of this title is that midseason decision to choose standards over excuses. It carried through an edgy playoff run that tried to jar them loose: Seattle forced a decisive Game 3 that  ; Indiana dragged them   that would have cracked lesser champions. “There were a lot of doubts besides in that locker room,” Aces point guard Chelsea Gray said. “We stayed the course and trusted the process the entire time.” And always, there was Wilson: shrinking options at the rim and expanding them at the elbow, the league’s most terrifying deterrent and its cleanest late-clock answer in the same body. There’s a special joy in watching her go about her work. If her Game 3 winner was the cinematic flourish, her Game 4 closeout was the masterclass in control when the jumpers weren’t falling. On a night where she missed 14 of her 21 attempts from the floor, Wilson changed the terms instead – owning the glass, spiking shots, jumping passing lanes, making a home at the stripe and going 17-for-19 there. Possession by possession, she bent the game back to her will. This year pushes past tidy résumé-building and into something rarer. Wilson wasn’t just the best player in this series; she was the best player in the sport, shouldering into a GOAT conversation that has long begun with Cheryl Miller’s legend and Maya Moore’s incandescent peak. She bears the weight lightly, which is part of the spell. The   during the post-game presser – equal parts Baptist church joke and credo on patience and faith – landed because it sounded like her: unguarded, joyful, before quietly matter-of-fact and clear-eyed in expounding on the work it takes to win. Asked to redefine greatness now that she’s stacking championships at a historic clip, Wilson widened the lens. “Obviously I would still [say] banners, but I think greatness is … it’s who you’re around. This is greatness. This group here, we were battle-tested, top to bottom battle-tested. We showed up every single day with a mind of being great,” she said in Friday’s aftermath. “You’ve got to be great when the lights aren’t on you. You’ve got to be great when nobody’s in the gym with you. You’ve got to be great when you may not get anything on the end. That is what greatness is to me because that is consistency and that is just you doing the right things because it’s right.” Hammon’s appraisal supplied a blunt epigraph to the season: you can debate basketball’s Mount Rushmore if you want, but Wilson is “alone on Everest”. That sounds like flattery until you try to explain Wilson’s 2025 without resorting to the obvious truth that she controlled both ends of the court more completely than any of her peers. The Aces’ stars toggled roles without complaint – Young from flamethrower to rebounding guard; Gray from closer to organizer; free-agent addition Jewell Loyd (now  , by the way) from gunner to grit – and the bench minutes that once felt like a liability turned into leverage thanks to Dana Evans and company. But it all orbited the same gravitational pull of their 6ft 4in talisman. The closer a series got to wobble-time, the calmer Wilson seemed to breathe. Where it goes from here is business as much as basketball. Much of the WNBA’s workforce, including key Aces, approach free agency as the deadline for a new collective bargaining agreement ticks louder. That uncertainty hovered even as the confetti fell. It also hovered over a fortnight of renewed friction between the league office and locker rooms. Reports of comments   about players being “on their knees” in gratitude – which the Englebert has partially disputed – landed like a cymbal crash against the reality on the floor: the players are the product. The Mortgage Matchup Center crowd underscored that point   during Englebert’s trophy presentation, while Gray did it from the dais. “When you have great players, you need to treat them like that. That’s payment. That’s treatment. That’s revenue share,” she said. “There’s no league without the players.” In the end, two scenes bookend the truth of this season: an August text on the night of a 53-point embarrassment, and an October fadeaway that hushed a cauldron in the desert. The improbable midseason swerve into inevitability – the choice to recommit, then the refusal to blink – turned both into canon. The Aces rediscovered their standard at rock bottom and rode it back to the summit. Perhaps the verdict, delivered by the player who just authored a season like no other, was in from the start.", "tags": ["las", "vegas", "aces", "wnba", "phoenix", "mercury", "us", "sports", "comment"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/10/who-will-run-against-trump-in-2028-please-step-forward-now-dont-wait", "content": "he Democratic politicians on the national scene, charged with leading the opposition, continue to bring a butterknife to the ongoing gunfight that is US politics under  . Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, comes across as a weary grandpa, glasses perched halfway down his nose as he reads his script in sleep-inducing monotone. Quick – who’s the minority leader of the House? You get bonus points if you can identify Hakeem Jeffries. Charismatic he is not. What’s to be done? Democrats cannot afford to play possum and wait for Trump to implode, as onetime political guru James Carville urged in a New York Times opinion piece. That won’t be Trump’s fate – his boast that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters isn’t far off the mark. Barack Obama could go toe-to-toe with Trump. He’s the most popular living president – a YouGov poll, taken just before the last election, showed that over half of all Americans would most likely vote for him. Although the two-term president can’t run again, he’d garner the attention that Democrats badly need. But the former president has had next to nothing to say about Trump’s initiatives. While he has scolded Democratic politicians for not speaking out, he has gone silent. He hasn’t appeared at any public event staged by opponents of the president. Instead, he’s producing movies and documentaries, playing golf (as of 2016, he was an “honest 13”) and building an $18m mansion in Hawaii. What’s the alternative? Several presidential hopefuls have already hit the rubber-chicken circuit, making coy noises about their intentions for 2028, but that’s not nearly good enough. These desperate times demand boldness. Here’s my proposition:  Hear me out before you start laughing. For starters, the reign of the   and its timid successors like Kamala Harris is finally over. That’s the message delivered by 33-year-old Zohran Mamdani, who trounced septuagenarian Andrew Cuomo, avatar of the past, in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary. Whoever runs for president should take a leaf from Mamdani’s playbook. No more tedious, repetitious TV ads. It is essential to reach voters where they are, knocking on doors, listening to what they say about what matters to them, then turning out a stream of TikTok and Instagram videos, delivering messages that resonate. Goodbye to laundry lists of forgettable nostrums, like the multipoint policy plans that Harris lugged around. My ideal candidate must have the skill to communicate ideas – bold ideas, not small-bore suggestions – in a non-wonky way. As former New York governor Mario Cuomo memorably put it: “You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose.” While it’s hard to imagine any Democrat winning over the Maga diehards, Republican voters who held their noses and voted for Trump could be swayed by someone who concentrated on meat-and-potato issues, pledging to build millions of units of affordable housing, deliver universal preschool and affordable healthcare, picking up the bill with a fair tax law. That was Mamdani’s message, and a considerable number of Trump backers voted for him after hearing his pitch. My candidate should be prepared to take on some of the Democratic party’s sacred cows. Assailing Israel for the war crimes committed in Gaza comes to mind. The toughest hurdle is raising enough money to be taken seriously, but it isn’t impossible. Billionaires including the Democratic mega-donor George Soros, Bill Gates, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman recently formed a group called Billionaires Against Billionaires to do battle with Trump’s coterie of billionaires. Imagine the impact if these mega-donors join forces with grassroots groups nationwide. The Democratic Party has a deep bench, and there’s no shortage of politicians who could fill the bill. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona senator Ruben Gallego and Kentucky governor Andy Beshear are among those who come to mind. And while the first profile-in-courage candidate will have first-mover advantage, others may well enter the fray. Let’s be clear – there isn’t a candidate, no matter how artful, who has a prayer of dislodging Trump from his imperial perch. But the presidential hopeful who decides that now is the time to present themself as a genuine alternative will attract attention, and right now, attention is what matters most.

Russell Vought, the director of the White House office of management and budget, wrote on social media that “RIFs have begun”, referring to the government’s reduction-in-force procedure to let employees go. A  revealed that hundreds of layoffs took place across the executive branch, including notices sent to employees at the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Education and several others. The document shows that about 315 employees at the Department of Commerce, 466 employees at the Department of Education, 187 employees at the Department of Energy, from 1,100 to 1,200 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, 442 employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 176 employees at the Department of Homeland Security and 1,446 employees at the Department of Treasury received RIF notices. Union leaders warned the layoffs would have “devastating effects” on services relied upon by millions of Americans, and pledged to challenge the moves in court. “It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” said Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which represents 800,000 federal and DC government workers. Vought had warned that federal agencies could slash jobs if the government shuts down, but the   largely held off after funding lapsed last week. Asked at a press conference before Vought’s announcement why no layoffs had occurred, the top Senate Republican, John Thune, signaled they would happen soon. “The White House has now for 10 days laid off doing anything in hopes that enough Senate   would come to their senses and do the right thing and fund the government,” he said. “My expectation is, yes, they’re going to start making some decisions about how to move money around, which agencies and departments are going to be impacted, which programs are going to be impacted, which employees are going to be impacted. That’s what a shutdown does.” The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US,   to Vought’s post on Friday, saying: “America’s unions will see you in court.” Last week, the AFGE and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed for a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from carrying out any reductions in force (RIFs) during the shutdown. The unions filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order on Friday, following Vought’s post. Lee Saunders, president of the AFSCME, said: “These mass firings are illegal and will have devastating effects on the services millions of Americans rely on every day. Whether it’s food inspectors, public safety workers, or the countless other public service workers who keep America running, federal employees should not be bargaining chips in this administration’s political games. “By illegally firing these workers, the administration isn’t just targeting federal employees, it’s hurting their families and the communities they serve every day. We will pursue every available legal avenue to stop this administration’s unlawful attacks on public service workers’ freedoms and jobs.” Congressional   have refused to vote for a Republican-backed bill to restore funding unless it includes an array of healthcare-centered concessions. After holding seven unsuccessful votes on the parties’ spending bills, the Senate’s   leaders have put the chamber in recess until next Tuesday, meaning the standoff is unlikely to be resolved before then. The layoffs came on the same day government employees received only a partial paycheck covering the final days of September but not the beginning of October, since appropriations lapsed at the start of the month. At a Friday-morning press conference, the Republican House speaker,  , blasted Senate Democrats for not supporting the GOP’s bill, which passed his chamber on a near party-line vote.If the government is not reopened by next Wednesday, US military personnel are set to miss a paycheck. “This is the last paycheck that 700,000 federal workers will see until Washington Democrats decide to do their job and reopen the government,” Johnson said. “Starting next week, American service members, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck, are going to miss a full paycheck. If Democrats don’t end this shutdown by Monday, then that October 15 date will pass us by.” Johnson has kept the House out of session throughout the shutdown in an effort to pressure Senate Democrats into supporting the Republican funding proposal. Earlier this week, a group of House Democrats sent the speaker a letter asking him to allow a vote on legislation that would ensure US troops get paid during a shutdown, but Johnson has refused to bring lawmakers back to Washington. The Senate has become a chokepoint in the funding battle because any legislation needs at least 60 votes to advance in the chamber. In exchange for their support, Democratic senators are demanding that premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act health plans be extended beyond their end-of-the-year expiration date. They are also seeking safeguards against Donald Trump’s   of congressionally approved funding, a restoration of   outlets and an undoing of cuts to the   healthcare program for poor and disabled Americans. Max Stier, the president and CEO of the non-profit Partnership for Public Service, condemned the gridlock’s impact on government workers. “It is wrong to make federal employees suffer because our leaders in Congress and the White House have failed to keep our government open and operational,” Stier said. “Our air traffic controllers, VA nurses, smoke jumpers and food inspectors are not responsible for this government shutdown, and they shouldn’t bear the financial burden created by the failures of our elected officials. The irony is that members of Congress and senior White House leaders are continuing to be paid.” Earlier this week, on 7 October, a federal judge  the Trump administration to provide specifics on the status of any layoff plans, the affected agencies and whether any federal employees had been recalled to work to carry out layoffs, by Friday, 10 October. A   by the Center for American Progress on 30 September argued that a government shutdown limits the ability of the Trump administration to carry out firings, citing guidance from the office of management and budget that admitted any permanent layoffs need to have been initiated before the shutdown began. “Constraints on permanently firing federal employees during a shutdown largely exist because of the   and the distinction between ‘shutdown furloughs’ that happen during a lapse in congressional appropriations and ‘administrative furloughs’, which are department and agency procedures on how to permanently let staff go, including – for example – through a RIF,” the report, authored by Greta Bedekovics, associate director of democracy policy at the Center for American Progress, states. “The Trump administration’s threats to layoff federal employees should be understood as a goal of the administration that will be pursued with or without a government shutdown and should not drive lawmakers’ decisions on whether to support government funding bills.”", "tags": ["us", "federal", "government", "shutdown", "2025", "mike", "johnson", "donald", "trump", "republicans", "democrats", "house", "of", "representatives", "us", "senate", "news"]},

He is also such a hate-filled little man that members of his own family are publicly rebuking him. During Donald Trump’s first term, in 2018, Miller’s uncle, Dr David Glosser, wrote a   calling Miller an “immigration hypocrite”. Glosser noted that if Miller’s hardline immigration policies “had been in force a century ago, our family [Jewish refugees who fled to the US from Europe to avoid persecution] would have been wiped out”. Then, in July, a woman called  , Miller’s cousin and former babysitter, wrote a viral Facebook post calling the Trump aide “the face of evil”. Miller’s cruelty, she said, left her feeling “ashamed and shattered”. While some of his extended family can’t seem to stand him, Miller does have a very enthusiastic cheerleader in the form of the Fox News host Jesse Watters. Last October, Watters claimed that his show’s audience   Miller is “some sort of sexual matador” and asked Miller to comment on this. The   responded by telling young men to “be the alpha … show that you are not a beta … Be a proud and loud Trump supporter and your dating life will be fantastic.” This is terrible advice for many reasons, not least of which is the fact that gen Z women are the   group in the US. I’m afraid it doesn’t end there; a couple of weeks ago, the Fox News host had Miller’s wife,   (a Maga bigwig in her own right), on his show to chat about how sexy Stephen is. “What is it like being married to such a sexual matador?”  . Very inspiring, apparently; he wakes up every morning excited about how he is going to “defeat the left”. It doesn’t even end  . This week, Watters once again sang his favourite man’s praises on TV, calling Miller a “policy savant”.  : “Men who are high-value men, like Stephen Miller, take risks. They’re brave, they’re unafraid, they’re confident and they’re on a mission. And they have younger wives with beautiful children.” Watters went on to claim that the representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez “wants to sleep with Miller … it is so obvious”. The whole spiel was so weird that even Watters’s colleague, Greg Gutfeld, appeared disturbed. “That was pretty creepy,” Gutfeld said. While Watters doesn’t seem to need an excuse to praise Miller, this week’s episode wasn’t entirely unprompted. Rather, Watters was reacting to an Instagram video in which Ocasio-Cortez called Miller a clown and urged  . “Miller looks like he is so mad that he is 4’10” that he’s taking that anger out at any other population possible,” AOC said in the video. “Laugh at them! Laugh at them!” It’s not particularly clever to mock someone’s height. (AOC has   she loves “short kings” and was talking about how “big or small someone is on the inside”.) Nevertheless, the lawmaker is absolutely correct that the way to get under the skin of people in Maga-land is to laugh at them. Ghouls like Trump and Miller don’t care if you call them evil or hypocritical. They don’t care if you use facts and logic against them. What they care about is being laughed at. What they really can’t stand is being mocked. “Humor has long been one of the most effective weapons of anti-authoritarian politics,” Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a scholar on fascism,   after Democrats started calling Republicans “weird”. You can see how thin-skinned Maga is by the ridiculous amount of traction that AOC’s throwaway joke has had.   that three primetime Fox News hosts   Miller’s height: Watters, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. Ingraham even had Miller on her show and played the clip to him while he squirmed in discomfort. “What a train wreck, what a train wreck … that lady is a walking nightmare,” Miller replied. He also clarified that he is 5’10”. A very big boy. Steven Cheung, who is White House director of communications, also responded to Ocasio-Cortez’s comments   on his official Twitter account saying: “Sounds like @AOC is often used to the shorter things in life.” He added a pinching hand emoji, which is sometimes used to suggest a small penis. The Trump administration should not be underestimated by any means. They are organized, they are ruthless, and they are proving extremely effective at implementing their  . But while we shouldn’t underestimate Trumpers, it’s helpful to remember that they’re not invincible. AOC is right: we should laugh at them. It’s either laugh or cry.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-physical-walter-reed", "content": " – the oldest person ever to be elected US president – had what he has described as a “semiannual physical” at the Walter Reed national military medical center on Friday. The visit, which the White House announced earlier this week, comes as Trump is preparing to travel to the Middle East on the heels of a ceasefire deal in the  . The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, described it as a “routine yearly checkup”, although the president had his annual physical in April. Trump left the White House at about 10.45am on Friday and returned to the grounds at 2.15pm, which was slightly ahead of schedule. He did not answer questions from reporters upon his arrival, and the White House has not indicated when it would release results or more information about his exams. The White House declined to explain why Trump was getting a yearly checkup at Walter Reed, which is in Bethesda, Maryland, six months after his annual exam. But in an exchange with reporters on Thursday, the Republican president said it was a “semiannual physical”. “I’m meeting with the troops, and I’m also going to do a, sort of, semiannual physical, which I do,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “I think I’m in great shape, but I’ll let you know.” A summary of the checkup from Trump’s doctor, Sean Barbabella, said the visit was part of his health maintenance plan. The doctor also wrote that Trump underwent an evaluation that included advanced imaging and laboratory testing, but cast the tests as routine and suggested that he is in “exceptional health”. Barbabella claimed Trump’s cardiac age was found to be 14 years younger than his age of 79. Trump’s April physical found that he was “fully fit” to serve as commander in chief. The three-page summary of the exam done by Barbabella said he had lost 20lb (9kg) since a medical exam in June 2020 and that he had an “active lifestyle” that “continues to contribute significantly” to the wellbeing of the president, who is 79. Since his April exam, Trump was diagnosed with  , a condition that can cause swelling, as the president has experienced in his legs and is common in older adults. Trump’s physician also addressed concern about bruising on the president’s hand, attributing it to irritation caused by frequent handshaking and his use of aspirin as a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen. Recent images of a purplish bruise on Trump’s hand, which appeared to have been covered with makeup, fueled online speculation that the president was ill. When Leavitt discussed the results of his chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis from the briefing room, she noted that the White House was disclosing details of the checkup to dispel rumors about Trump’s health. At the April physical, Trump also passed a short screening test to assess different brain functions. Presidents have large discretion over what health information they release to the public. Trump’s summary from his April exam included information about his weight, body mass index, past surgeries, mental health screenings, cholesterol levels and blood pressure. Trump’s previous medical reports typically produced a flattering report scarce on details. Trump has long been cagey about his health, and concern about the president’s wellbeing stretches back to his first term. But wild rumors reached a fever pitch when the president faded from public view for several days over the summer, with critics and TikTok influencers speculating that the president was on his deathbed. “NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE!” Trump wrote at the time, in an assertion that only fueled suspicions of a cover-up.

Sometimes the only power we have is to withhold our interest and project indifference. When we lose a game, it’s a lot easier to deny its legitimacy than to accept failure – like unplugging a PlayStation after getting blown up by a landmine in Call of Duty.

Trump’s entire worldview seems predicated on a notion that life is unfair, the system is rigged and he alone can balance the scales back toward justice.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/11/charlie-kirk-trump-maga-allies", "content": "Donald Trump and Maga allies have capitalized on the killing of rightwing influencer Charlie Kirk to expand attacks on liberal groups, donors, Democrats, and others by tarring many critics as the “enemy within” and “radical left” in a move that legal scholars and historians call authoritarian and anti-democratic. Kirk’s killing by a lone gunman spurred Trump and top allies to quickly launch conspiratorial charges against a bevy of political foes and an investigation of billionaire liberal donor George Soros. They also threatened legal action against TV network ABC after their late-night star Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension over clumsy comments about Kirk ended. While Kirk’s murder was a big personal blow to Trump and allies, a month on from the shocking event it seems to have provided cover for a sprawling retribution drive by the president and Maga world that endangers civil liberties against an array of critics in the media, universities, non-profits and other parts of American civil society, say scholars. At the memorial for the slain conservative leader right after Kirk’s widow movingly said she would “forgive” his killer, Trump angrily declared: “I hate my opponents and I don’t wish the best for them,” words that scholars viewed as unpresidential with the potential to fuel more violence. Similarly, even before the suspect in Kirk’s murder was arrested, Trump posited that “radical left” language contributed to his death. He also pledged to go after those people responsible for the violence plus “organizations that fund it and support it… We have radical-left lunatics out there, and we just have to beat the hell out of them.” Further, Trump’s escalating offensive against foes was palpable in his talk to hundreds of top military officials last month when he warned darkly about the need to counter “the enemy within” and suggested the military could be useful in his drive against crime in mostly Democratic cities which could serve as a military “training ground” too. On a related front on 8 October, as hundreds of national guard troops were poised to enter Chicago over the objections of the city’s mayor and the Illinois governor, both Democrats who had criticized Trump’s militarized immigration crackdown, Trump called for jailing them even though neither one had been charged with crimes. Historians and legal experts warn that Trump and the Maga world have exploited Kirk’s killing to justify unleashing far-reaching attacks on multiple critics. Trump and his allies are using “page one of the authoritarian playbook” in their accelerating attacks on political foes”, said Harvard government professor Steven Levitsky, who co-authored the book How Democracies Die. “You use political violence as a pretext to go after your political enemies. Some of them have been chomping at the bit to do this. They’re going after mainstream opponents and other critics. They’re defining unacceptable behavior as broadly as possible.” Levitsky stressed that Trump’s attacks on Soros and some other major funders of Democrats and liberal groups are part of a broad assault on civil society. “The goal is to tilt the playing field by going after anybody in civil society who could challenge them,” he said. “One way to weaken them is to go after the funders using a false pretense by linking them to violence or illegal behavior.” Pointedly, Trump in interviews days after Kirk’s killing charged in conspiratorial and evidence-free language that the 95-year-old Soros “should be put in jail” and was a “bad guy”. He told Fox & Friends that “we’re going to look into Soros” for possible violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (Rico) law. The justice department (DoJ) has opened investigations into Soros’ Open Society Foundations, which over decades have poured many millions of dollars into civil rights, human rights and democracy programs, according to the New York Times. The Soros Foundations have pushed back hard saying the accusations are “politically motivated attacks on civil society” designed to silence dissenting speech and stressed all its activities are “peaceful and lawful”. Legal experts say Trump’s hyped up drive to have Soros prosecuted on Rico charges is antithetical to the rule of law and part of Trump’s broader drive to weaponize DoJ against old enemies such as ex-FBI director James Comey who angered Trump for investigating Russian moves to help Trump win the 2016 election. Last month a Trump picked novice prosecutor filed a two count indictment of Comey for lying to Congress and obstruction of Congress, after Trump forced out a veteran prosecutor who didn’t pursue the charges reportedly because of the weakness of the evidence. Comey on 8 October pleaded not guilty. The same Trump picked prosecutor in Virginia, despite the objections of veteran prosecutors who had been ousted, on 9 October brought charges of bank fraud and false statements against the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who Trump has long reviled for winning a civil case against him and others for improperly inflating his real estate assets. James called the charges against her “baseless”, and part of Trump’s “weaponization” of the US justice system. “Trump’s invocation of Rico to investigate Soros is frivolously wrong-headed,” said ex-federal prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig. “It is yet another example of his weaponization of the law to target his enemies.” The threat of more attacks on non-profits was underscored when Democracy Defenders Fund announced on 1 October that more than 3,700 groups signed a letter sharply criticizing the administration for launching a campaign to “intimidate and silence charitable groups through executive action”. Besides Trump’s retribution moves, Trump’s radical deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, has branded the Democratic party “a domestic extremist organization” and blamed “terrorist networks” for Kirk’s murder, vowing the administration would be going after a “vast domestic terror network”. To realize this goal, Trump signed an executive memo two weeks after Kirk died dubbed “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence”. Citing Kirk’s killing, the memo laid the groundwork for a coordinated effort by among others the attorney general, the treasury secretary, the IRS commissioner. The memo called for a “national strategy to investigate, prosecute and disrupt entities and individuals engaged in acts of political violence and intimidation designed to suppress lawful political activity or obstruct the rule of law”. As part of that effort, Trump designated the leftist Antifa movement a “domestic terrorist organization”, although under US law no such designation exists. Specifically, Trump instructed his administration to “utilize all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt and dismantle any and all illegal operations – especially those involving terrorist actions – conducted by antifa.” Sign up to  A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Similarly, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, a leading Trump ally, instructed his office to launch sweeping investigations into “radical leftist organizations engaged in or providing support to those performing political violence”. Despite the Trump administration’s focus on linking the “radical left” to political violence, a study in 2024 that used to be on DoJ’s website stated that “the number of far-right attacks continues to outpace all other types of terrorism and domestic violent extremism.” A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that leftwing violence in the first half of 2025 had hit a 30-year high, but it noted that overall since 2016 rightwing violence has been much higher: the study cited 41 attacks by leftwing extremists compared to 152 from the far right in these years. Legal scholars warn that Trump administration actions against a range of liberal political targets and critics since Kirk’s death reflect growing authoritarian tendencies. “Hallmarks of authoritarian regimes include that they seek to undermine independent media outlets and NGOs, dissolve legal boundaries between the state and civil society, vilify critics and marginalized groups, personalize politics, and make dissent more costly,” Columbia law professor David Pozen told the Guardian. “ All of these authoritarian tendencies have been on display in the Trump administration’s response to the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk.” Historians too fear that Trump is using Kirk’s death to invoke conspiracies for political gains and revenge. “Since Charlie Kirk’s murder, President Trump has amplified and extended his penchant for leveling conspiracy charges,” said Russell Muirhead who chairs Dartmouth’s department of government. “The target is “domestic terrorist organizations”, which seems to include such peaceful pro-democratic anti-communist entities as George Soros’s Open Society Foundations. The effect is to describe the entirety of “the left” as a conspiracy, bent on destroying the country – including the Democratic party. Muirhead added: “The risk here is clear: conspiracy charges convert peaceful political opponents into enemies. Once that is accomplished, they no longer need to be respected or tolerated. They can be folded into shadowy ‘domestic terrorism networks’ and imprisoned – or worse.” Muirhead’s concerns were underscored in Trump’s 30 September speech warning of the “enemy within” to an audience of hundreds of top military leaders where he declared flatly that “America is under invasion from within,” claiming that “Democrats run most of the cities that are in bad shape.” Trump called these cities “very unsafe places and we’re going to straighten them out one by one,” a task that would be a “major part” of what some military leaders will be doing. Trump also bluntly suggested that the military “should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds”. Trump’s radical suggestions to the military crowd seemed to ignore the almost 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act that curbs using federal troops in law enforcement matters on US soil with some loopholes and exceptions. Legal experts too have raised loud alarms at Trump’s radical military schemes. “A president with dictatorial ambitions declaring that people in Democratic led cities are the ‘enemy within’ who have to be controlled by the use of the military is contrary to the very principles upon which this country was founded,” said Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now teaches law at American University. “One cannot help but wonder whether he will continue to expand the Democratic cities in which he will use the military and whether that military presence will continue through the 2026 midterm election, in an effort to try to undermine free and fair elections.” Pozen concurred that “President Trump’s latest comment to military leadership about the enemy ‘from within’ is yet another familiar authoritarian trope – an especially scary one”. More broadly, legal scholars say Trump’s far flung attacks on the radical left endangers the” laws and traditions” that underpin democracy. “Trump deploys outrageous rhetoric to try to legitimate his unconstitutional overreach,” said Peter Shane, who teaches constitutional law at New York University. “Whether it’s the baseless withholding of funds from private institutions that fail to bend the knee or fantasizing about the use of cities with Democratic mayors to train the military, Trump is running roughshod over the laws and traditions that have long sustained a robust American democracy.”", "tags": ["charlie", "kirk", "shooting", "donald", "trump", "us", "politics", "far", "right", "(us)", "news"]},

Firefighters thought it had been extinguished the same day, but the blaze smoldered underground for nearly a week before reigniting on 7 January amid extremely powerful winds, eventually transforming into the Palisades fire. According to the court documents, Rinderknecht offered to help firefighters fight the Lachman fire when he returned to the scene, which authorities described as “highly unusual conduct”. The Lachman fire grew to eight to 10 acres before being suppressed by the LA fire department. After calling 911 and seeing firefighters driving up Palisades Drive to respond to the fire, Rinderknecht turned around, followed the firefighters up to the fire and filmed them responding to it, according to the criminal complaint. “Arsonists sometimes like to watch firefighters respond to the fires that they have set,” the court document said. The Palisades fire eventually burned more than 23,000 acres (9,300 hectares), killed 12 people, destroyed more than 6,800 structures and   worth of damage. Acting US attorney Bill Essayli   the incident as “a single person’s recklessness” leading to catastrophic loss. Digital evidence, including GPS data obtained from the suspect’s phone and video footage, revealed that months before the fire, Rinderknecht used ChatGPT to generate images and prompts fixated on fire and destruction, including a dystopian scene of a city being burned down. Rinderknecht asked ChatGPT to show a burning forest and people running away from the fire. He also asked ChatGPT to depict a gigantic gate marked with a “big dollar sign”, according to the criminal complaint. “On the other side of the gate and the entire wall is a conglomerate of the richest people,” reads the prompt. “They are chilling, watching the world burn down, and watching the people struggle. They are laughing, enjoying themselves, and dancing.” Prosecutors also said Rinderknecht asked ChatGPT: “Are you at fault if a fire is lift because of your cigarettes”, misspelling the word “lit” with “lift”. (ChatGPT’s response was “Yes”, followed by an explanation, according to the complaint.) On Wednesday, authorities   the image ChatGPT generated at a press conference announcing the arrest. According to prosecutors, Rinderknecht had also used ChatGPT to confide an obsession with fires. In November, he typed into the chatbot that he burned a Bible and wrote: “It felt amazing. I felt so liberated.” He wrote a similar message to a family member. Authorities have also laid out how Rinderknecht attempted to cover his tracks after after allegedly igniting the fire. According to prosecutors, Rinderknecht called 911 to report the fire but lied about his location, and told the police that he was at the base of the trail when geolocation data showed he was only 30ft from the flames. Federal prosecutors have charged Rinderknecht, who later relocated to Florida, with destruction of property by means of fire, a crime carrying a minimum sentence of five years and up to 20 years in prison. OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, the assistant US attorney Rachel Lyons said during a hearing in federal court in Orlando that Rinderknecht was a flight risk because he had family in France and spoke French. Shackled and wearing a red jail uniform, Rinderknecht listened attentively as an agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recounted the family’s concerns about his mental health. His relatives in Florida expressed fear for their safety, telling investigators his mental state had deteriorated and that they were pursuing eviction proceedings. A federal magistrate ordered him to  . A preliminary hearing to review the facts of the case was scheduled for 17 October. Rinderknecht was arrested on Tuesday but he was first interviewed by authorities on 24 January. Investigators said during the intervening months, they worked to rule out other potential causes for the first fire’s ignition, such as fireworks or lightning strikes. All the while they were combing through the suspect’s phone to track his whereabouts on the day it began. Kenny Cooper, special agent in charge of the ATF’s   field division, said his agency pursued more than 200 leads in the US and abroad while scouring the hillsides where the fire was ignited. “Though homes and businesses cannot be rebuilt, this arrest, we hope, will bring a measure of justice to all those who were impacted,” said Essayli. The investigation’s findings have brought some long-sought-after answers for Palisades residents. The area is still full of charred ruins following a cleanup that took months, and the neighborhood is only slowly beginning to rebuild. On Friday, the office of the   governor, Gavin Newsom, announced a package of bills to help the ongoing recovery and rebuilding of the communities in the Los Angeles area affected by the Eaton and Palisades fires. “While it’s been nine months since these firestorms struck Los Angeles, the destruction and devastation left behind is still fresh for thousands of survivors and remains a constant reminder that we have more to do to support our fellow Californians,” Newsom said in a  .", "tags": ["los", "angeles", "california", "wildfires", "california", "wildfires", "west", "coast", "news"]},

As the shutdown got under way, Schumer explained, the   believed that Democrats would quickly fold and vote to reopen the government, but instead they had stuck to their guns for a week and a half, demanding an array of concessions on healthcare and other issues. Outrage followed from Republicans, who printed out the Senate minority leader’s remark on posters and condemned it before press conferences. The shutdown has prompted federal agencies to close or curtail operations nationwide, and forced hundreds of thousands of employees to stay home without immediate pay. Schumer, Republicans argued, was being callous. “I’ve been asked many times in interviews the last couple days: ‘You seem angry – you don’t get angry a lot.’ I don’t, but this is beyond the pale,” the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, said at a press conference on Friday morning, the 10th day of the shutdown. “What Chuck Schumer is doing right now, it’s sickening.” Hours later, the White House took it upon itself to increase the misery for government employees when Russ Vought, the director of the office of management and budget,   through on   to carry out layoffs. The budget office said that   4,000 federal workers were being fired from a variety of agencies that had already shrunk in the second Trump administration, and the funding situation was “fluid and rapidly evolving”. Legal challenges are likely to follow, but still, now it was the Democrats’ turn to accuse the GOP of brutality. “Let’s be blunt: nobody’s forcing Trump and Vought to do this,” Schumer said in a statement. “They don’t have to do it; they want to. They’re callously choosing to hurt people – the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.” It was the latest salvo in a battle that began when government funding lapsed on 1 October and has since degenerated into legislative trench warfare.   have resulted in no breakthroughs, with lawmakers from both parties preventing the other’s proposals from reaching the 60-vote threshold needed to advance. Democrats are maximizing the leverage they have in the upper chamber by refusing to reopen the government until   for Affordable Care Act health plans are extended into next year. They also want cuts to the Medicaid program for poor and disabled Americans reversed, funding to public media outlets such as PBS and NPR restored and Donald Trump’s use of “ ” to slash spending curbed. Most of those are non-starters for Republicans, who insist government funding be restarted before negotiations take place. They’ve ascribed a variety of motivations to Democrats’ intransigence, from the rise of   as the Democratic nominee for New York mayor to the influence of a “far-left base” that has the party’s leaders in their thrall. On Friday, Johnson posited that Democratic senators were holding out because they were concerned about a   planned for 18 October – which he called a “hate America rally” and where attendees might target party leaders if they decided to end the shutdown. “It is an outrageous gathering for outrageous purposes, but the Democrats in the Senate have shown that they’re afraid of that crowd,” Johnson said, alleging that “the   crowd, and the pro-Hamas crowd and the Marxists” would be in attendance. “They’re willing to hold the American people hostage so that they don’t have to face an angry mob – that’s a big chunk of their base,” he said.

And it’s a sight to see. It’s a welcome strategic shift,” Ezra Levin, co-executive director of progressive organizing group Indivisible, said. In March, Schumer opted to work with Republicans on keeping the government open, prompting Indivisible to call for him to step aside as minority leader. Months later, Levin says his group is coordinating with Schumer’s office on actions to support Democratic lawmakers as the shutdown wears on, and believes the party should not compromise on its demands. Not only are Democrats’ demands “wildly popular”, Republicans are not to be trusted to honor any agreement, he said. Trump and his allies in Congress have made clear their interest in rescissions packages, which can be passed on a party-line vote, to cut spending approved with bipartisan support. After   in July that clawed back $9bn in funding for public media and foreign aid, Johnson said he is considering putting together another. “This regime is treating the federal budget like a personal bank account for  , and we should stop that,” Levin said. “No deal is a real deal unless you have rescission and payment language. “We’ve got the goods.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/11/trump-immigration-dreamers-daca", "content": "The   has once again put Dreamers on a rollercoaster ride. The federal government is sending mixed signals about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a popular program   under Barack Obama that had until recently allowed undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children to live and work legally without serious risk of deportation. On one hand, in a new  , the federal government suggested it may eventually resume official consideration of initial Daca applications for the first time in years, which could let tens of   of people finally have their petitions processed. On the other, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has claimed that immigrants who say they are under the Daca umbrella “are not automatically protected from deportations”, as the program “does not confer any form of legal status in this country”. Such an approach has been used by Trump officials to justify detaining about   during the new administration so far – despite no White House or DHS memo, regulation or executive order revealing a policy change. “We started hearing from those detained that when they tell   [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents that they have Daca, the Ice agents say: ‘Oh, that doesn’t matter any more’,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, a spokesperson for the immigrant youth organization United We Dream. Here’s what to know about Daca, the “Dreamers” it protects, and how Donald Trump’s   immigrant   is upending that protection. “Dreamers” is a nickname for immigrants brought stateside as children, who do not have legal status. One estimate counts almost 2.5 million   in the US. The moniker refers to the  , proposed legislation that has been deliberated for decades in an attempt to offer Dreamers a pathway to legal immigration status. Lawmakers have introduced at least 20 iterations of the bill, but despite bipartisan support, no version has cleared both chambers of Congress. So-called Daca recipients are the subset of Dreamers who have been able to qualify for the Daca program. There are more than 525,000 active Daca recipients nationwide, the vast majority from Mexico, though beneficiaries come from countries around the globe. Daca recipients’ average age is 31 years old. California and Texas host the largest Daca populations by far, with 147,440 and 87,890 respectively. In 2023, more than nine out of 10 Daca recipients who were   by national immigrant-focused organizations were either employed or in school. They reported that having Daca protections had made it   for them to find jobs that paid better, work in fields that reflected their education and long-term career goals, get professional licenses and reach economic independence. The program had also opened the door for some beneficiaries to buy homes and cars. The   policy debuted on 15 June 2012 to address Dreamers’ need to work legally and be “ ” in the US rather than hide from immigration enforcement and work under the table. To qualify, an applicant must have come to the country before they were 15 years old, have been aged 30 or younger on the date the Obama administration announced the program and have resided in the US since June 2007, among other requirements. Daca access   for anyone convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors. Although the program has been a lifeline for many undocumented youth, it’s not a legal status or pathway to citizenship, and the antiquated cutoff dates for eligibility have made it so that Dreamers in high school now are less likely to qualify. At the same time, protracted   has   paused the processing of initial Daca applications. “I think it’s really important to understand how tragic it is that young people who are Americans in every sense but lack one piece of paper here not only aren’t getting a pathway to citizenship, but aren’t even getting these very basic and temporary deportation protections and work authorizations,” said Todd Schulte, president of the advocacy group  . Why Congress hasn’t done anything to provide more stability for Dreamers is the “billion-dollar question”, said Diana Pliego, senior strategist for campaigns at the National Immigration Law Center – especially, she added, when   of Americans support a pathway to citizenship for them, and when it’s estimated that providing that would   about $800bn in US gross domestic product growth over a 10-year period. Earlier this year, the fifth circuit court of appeals   in practice that Daca and work permit adjudications should restart as normal everywhere except Texas, where officials successfully argued the state was negatively affected by Daca recipients because of education and healthcare costs. The window has closed for appeals to the  , at least for the time being. Now, a district court will eventually decide how to implement the fifth circuit’s ruling, and in a recent court filing, the Trump administration outlined its vision for complying, in part through restarting initial adjudications of Daca petitions. Yet, simultaneously, the   said those proposals would “not limit DHS from undertaking any future lawful changes to Daca”, and for now, the status quo prevails. “This administration can do many things. So we’re just worried about creating an expectation or false hope for people with initial applications,” said Macedo do Nascimento. Trump tried to   out Daca during his first administration but was ultimately   by the supreme court. Though they are likely to still receive deportation protections, there’s a risk that Texas Dreamers may lose both their work permits and their “lawful presence” designation, which would affect their economic prospects and could have larger immigration consequences. Even as the Trump administration floats restarting initial Daca adjudications, it is arresting current Daca recipients as part of its  . Evenezer Cortez Martínez – who came to the US when he was four years old and had a valid Daca permit through October 2026 – was   to Mexico in March. He was eventually allowed to return to his wife and children in Kansas City, though he said: “I still have that doubt about whether it’s really true that I’m [back] here.” Similarly, in August, Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira was targeted in El Paso, Texas, in front of his children, his arm being dislocated during the chaos, before he was detained in New Mexico. DHS called him a “criminal illegal alien” because of a decade-old charge for marijuana possession as a teenager that was later reduced to disorderly conduct, and that had never stopped the agency from renewing his Daca protections. Cortez Martínez and Gamez Lira are two of   known Daca recipients who have been arrested, detained or deported this year. Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, has   Daca recipients to consider voluntary deportation. To Pliego, that would be a loss for the US. “These are people who have built their lives here, who, you know, have been here since they were young kids,” she said. “This is their home. And so we’re losing longstanding community members who are contributing to the country, who are giving back in a lot of ways.”", "tags": ["us", "immigration", "children", "trump", "administration", "us", "politics", "explainers"]},

The appeals court granted a pause in the case until it can hear further arguments. The decision to prevent the troops from protecting federal property or going on patrol comes after federal judge April Perry ruled on Thursday to temporarily block the national guard deployment for at least two weeks, finding no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois as Trump continues his immigration crackdown in major cities across the US. On Friday, Democratic US senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth said they had visited an immigration enforcement building near   but were barred from going inside. The senators stopped by the facility in suburban Broadview on Friday, requesting a tour of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility and to deliver supplies to protesters who have been demonstrating at the site for weeks. Their visit coincides with a ruling that the fencing installed at the site must be taken down. A federal judge late Thursday ordered Ice to remove an 8ft-tall (2.4 meters) fence outside the Broadview facility after the Village of Broadview said it illegally blocks a public street. Both senators spoke to the local NBC News affiliate while there and have pushed for answers and called for oversight into the conditions inside the facility. “We just want to go in and look at the facility and see what the conditions are and they would not let us in. It is shameful,” Duckworth said. “They’ve refused to tell us this information,” Durbin stated. “I’ve done this job for a few years now, I’ve never had this stonewalling by any presidential administration.” “What are you afraid of?” Duckworth said to reporters, referring to the government. “You don’t hide, you don’t run away when you’re proud of what you’re doing.” The senators said they have congressional oversight authority. “Something is going on in there they don’t want us to see,” Durbin said. “I don’t know what it is.” To the south, in  , at least nine armed guard members began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, a Memphis landmark, about a mile (1.6km) from historic Beale Street and FedExForum, where the NBA’s Grizzlies play.

By contrast, Trump has attempted to deploy national guard troops – including some from Texas and California – in Portland and Chicago after taking control of them himself, over objections from state and local leaders who say such interference violates their sovereignty and federal law. Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities. The US district judge April Perry in Chicago said the   had violated the 10th amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th amendment, which assures due process and equal protection, when he ordered national guard troops to that city. In a written order Friday explaining her rationale, Perry noted the nation’s long aversion to having military involvement in domestic policing. “Not even the Founding Father most ardently in favor of a strong federal government” – referring to Alexander Hamilton – “believed that one state’s militia could be sent to another state for the purposes of political retribution,” Perry wrote. “The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said. An earlier court battle in Oregon delayed a similar troop deployment to Portland. The 9th US circuit court of appeals heard arguments in that case Thursday.

It seeks to undermine it.   published on the US Department of State’s Substack, written in the same paranoid, bombastic language as Viktor Orbán’s speeches, accused Europe of “an aggressive campaign against Western civilization itself”. It condemned supposed restrictions on authoritarian parties across the EU, from the AfD in Germany to PiS in Poland.  \n  What is to be done? Europe’s anti-coercion instrument works by calculating the degree of the coercion and imposing counter-actions. Provided most European governments agree, the European Commission could kick US goods and services out of Europe’s market, or apply tariffs to them. It can strip their intellectual property rights, block their investments and require reparations as a condition of readmittance to Europe’s market. The instrument is not merely economic retaliation; it is a declaration of political will. It was designed to signal that Europe would never tolerate foreign coercion. But now, when it is needed most, it lies unused. It is not a bazooka. It is a paperweight. In the months leading to the EU-US trade deal, many European governments talked tough in public, but failed to push for the instrument to be activated. Others, including Ireland and Italy, publicly pushed for  . A softer line is the last thing that Europe needs. It must enforce its laws, even when they are inconvenient. Along with the anti-coercion instrument, Europe should shut down social media “for you”-style algorithms, that recommend content the user has not asked for, on European soil until they are proven safe for democracy. Citizens – not the algorithms of foreign oligarchs beholden to foreign interests – should have the freedom to decide for themselves what they see and share online. Trump is putting Europe under pressure to water down its digital rulebook. But now more than ever, Europe should hold large US tech firms accountable for anti-competitive market rigging,  , and  . Brussels must hold Ireland accountable for   Europe’s digital rules on US firms. Enforcement is not enough, however. Europe must progressively replace all non-EU “big tech” platforms and cloud services over the next decade with homegrown alternatives. The real danger of this moment is that if Europe does not act now, it will never act again. The longer it waits, the deeper the erosion of its confidence in itself. The more it will believe resistance is futile. The more it will accept that its laws are not binding, its institutions not sovereign, its democracy not self-determined. When that happens, the path to authoritarianism becomes inevitable, through algorithmic manipulation on social media and the normalisation of lies. If Europe continues to cower, it will be drawn into that same abyss. Europe must act now, not only to push back against Trump, but to create space for itself to exist as a free and sovereign entity. And in doing so, it must plant a flag that the rest of the world can see. In Canada, South Korea and Japan, democracies are watching. They are wondering if the EU, the last bastion of liberal multilateralism, will resist foreign pressure or surrender to it. They are asking whether democratic institutions can survive when the most powerful democracy in the world turns its back on them. They also see the example of Lula in Brazil, who   and demonstrated that the way to deal with a bully is to hit hard.

The British steel industry now faces a calamity so severe, insiders say it could be “terminal”. The vast majority – 80% – of its  , which this week revealed plans to   by almost half. The remainder will be subject to a 50% tariff. The UK steel industry will be butchered. Thank you, EU. Thank you, Brexit. Whenever I meet politicians who championed   nowadays, I ask them a simple question: do you still think you were right? A few fools mutter, “Yes, on balance” and “In the long term, perhaps.” The honest ones shrug and look uncomfortable. We can all accept that some day a new generation of British politicians will resume open trade across the Channel. It is normal for an island, and makes sense. So I ask the honest ones: why not go public? Make a headline, stand up, apologise and get the ball rolling? None has done so. In May, Starmer timidly negotiated a   with Brussels. This injected pockets of sanity into increasingly chaotic border controls, especially on food. A few more EU students whom Brexit had crassly restricted may be admitted, along with a new e-gate for passport entry. There must still be checks – they start rolling out   – to enforce the rule limiting Britons to no more than 90 out of any 180 days  . Further resets are mooted in coming years. According to the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, most industries just cannot wait. They are struggling to keep open markets, and if necessary   by the back door. The chemicals industry exports more than 60% of its output to the EU. Brexiteers boasted it would be liberated from EU regulation, but setting up the UK’s own regulator cost £2bn and has not worked. According to the Chemical Industries Association, output has fallen by 35-40% since 2021. Between 2021 and 2023, British exports to the EU  . Brexiteers boasted that leaving the EU would be worth   a year. Cambridge Econometrics estimates that over the next decade Britain’s economy will be   than if we had not left the EU. This is self-harm on a heroic scale. What matters is how to scramble out of the pit. For most politicians, Brexit was never a policy priority. It was a leadership stunt, conducted with the grain of Britain’s shambolic political climate in the mid-to-late 2010s. Parliament enacted what a majority of members on all sides of the Commons knew was wrong. Worse still, when a soft Brexit was a feasible least-bad option, the Labour party failed to unite with anti-Brexit Tories to retain trading links with Europe. A hugely critical national issue sank into a swamp of parliamentary infighting, on a level approaching that now being  . The excuse was that the public wanted it. There is no such excuse now. Voters have had the courage to look at the facts and admit the mistake. According to YouGov, 61%   that Brexit is a failure. Just 13% now regard it as more of a success. Almost half want another referendum within five years, and 63% oppose loosening ties with the EU any further. That figure should daub every public meeting staged by Nigel Farage. The need is urgent for some coalition of politicians to take the lead and state baldly that Brexit was an error. Of the many failings of parliament, its inability to rise to the occasion above party politics is the most glaring. Britain’s re-entry into some trading relationship with   should now be the subject of a crossparty forum or select committee. They should press Starmer towards an urgent and concerted bid to reassociate with the EU. It will not be cheap, but it will be worth it. The leadership of the Tory party may find it hard to get its head round the necessary U-turn. That is tough. Its failure to explain or justify other aspects of its performance in government is already not serving it well. To accuse Starmer last May of “betrayal” and   over his EU deal was idiotic. There must be Tories who know the truth: honest politicians who follow Keynes’ purported advice and allow circumstances to alter their views. At present, as with anti-Trump Republicans in the US, the question is, when do they have the guts to surface? The public is clearly ready to see Brexit reversed. There cannot be a single industry that would oppose it. The need is for leadership. This should not be a partisan matter, except insofar as it might isolate Farage’s Reform party – and perhaps be his undoing. It should become a consensus. Of course it will not be easy.

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/algarve-albufeira-chega-far-right-local-elections-portugal", "content": "he road into Albufeira is thronged with billboards. Some, such as the faded one on a roundabout leading to the centre of the southern Portuguese resort city, offer sun-bleached glimpses of enticing real estate, golden beaches and vibrant nightlife. Others that have sprung up before Sunday’s local elections peddle promises of a different kind. By far the most numerous are those belonging to the far-right Chega party. Its political posters feature one-line grievances about the state of public health, education and housing and tell passing drivers that all these problems will be solved once Chega is in charge. There is a good chance that disillusioned Albufeirans – in a city that has voted for the centre-right PSD for more than two decades – will help give Chega a historic night on Sunday. After leapfrogging the socialists to take second place in  , Chega now hopes to leverage local-level frustrations to gain dozens of municipalities across the country and position itself for the same in the next general election. The Algarve sits at the very centre of the far-right’s strategy. Chega’s leader, André Ventura, a   and columnist who left the PSD to found the new party just six years ago, has called the region the “party’s stronghold” and the starting point of Portugal’s “conquest” by the far right. A recent poll for the Portuguese daily Diário de Notícias put Ventura’s party in the lead for the national vote for the first time. Its cocktail of populist policies, among them stricter controls on migration and chemical castration for paedophiles, have grabbed the attention of voters who are sick of a series of corruption scandals that have dogged the two main parties over recent years. Some believe Ventura may be on the fast track to becoming prime minister. “If in two months there’s a new political scandal and new snap elections, Chega would likely win the general elections,” said António Costa Pinto, a political scientist at Lisbon University’s Institute of Social Sciences. Chega voters in the Algarve argue that the party needs to use Sunday’s elections as a springboard for a nationwide takeover. Daniel Vicente, a 30-year-old barman from Albufeira, said: “I sincerely hope Chega wins. The Algarve is collapsing … Well,   is collapsing.” Housing prices are Vicente’s biggest concern. The Algarve, which faces the same consequences of overtourism as other parts of  , has the second highest housing costs in Portugal after Lisbon. Rental prices in Albufeira have risen by more than 16% in the last year alone. Vicente, repeating several of Chega’s talking points and misinformation, pointed the finger at the low-wage migrants who had come to the region. “Migrants who come here have everything going for them,” he said. “They share two-bedroom flats with 10 people. They pay little rent so they have money left. I don’t know what kind of support they receive but they must be receiving some support because they open up their own stores and you wonder how they did it. “I have to pay €800 (£696) for a flat and for everything else on a little more than the minimum wage [€870 a month]. No one gives me anything, and I don’t have enough money in the bank to ask for a loan to buy a house.” That resentment was Chega’s breeding ground. The party’s meteoric rise, boosted by three snap elections in the last three years and massively disproportionate media coverage, mostly lies in Ventura’s capacity to tap into people’s unexplored anger and use it to disrupt the political conversation. Miguel Carvalho, a journalist and author of the book Por Dentro do Chega (Inside Chega), said: “In 2019, Ventura went to places where politicians hadn’t been in years. He listened to people; he was their shoulder to cry on. And he promised he would shout for them whenever he could. “When he started making these statements, which people were ashamed to make in public, and when the media gave these statements a microphone and made Chega seem much bigger than it was, people started thinking they were also entitled to talk like that. They felt represented and Chega grew.” He said the party was “based around Ventura and it runs on his intuition. That was why it grew so much, so fast.” Gone were the days when Ventura had to chase Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s far-right Vox party, or Italy’s Matteo Salvini for a selfie, Carvalho said. “Now he’s the one who is invited. He travels to Spain and Hungary often. Bolsonaro supporters idolise him. Now he is their star.” The stark contrast between the Algarve’s image of a seaside paradise and the realities of daily life for many of its residents has made it a perfect target for Chega and an ideal laboratory for Portugal’s rapidly shifting politics. Albufeira has a population of 40,000 and attracts about half a million visitors annually. “Most of the economy is based on low wages, tourism, and migration associated with tourism,” said Costa Pinto. “These issues make people very sensitive to Chega’s message.” Near the popular Praia da Oura beach, three tuk-tuk drivers waiting for passengers spoke affectionately about how Ventura had been the first politician to care about them. “Ventura puts the Portuguese people first,” said Filipe Serrão, 50, who prides himself on having been one of the very first Chega activists in Albufeira. Rodney Sudário, 38, a Brazilian driver who has been in Portugal for 18 years, said he would cast his ballot for Chega. He was not bothered by Ventura’s demonisation of migrants because he thinks the problems lie with those “from non-Christian cultures” – something that his colleague Tiago Filipe, 29, agreed with. “Chega is not against migrants, only those who don’t want to work,” Filipe said. “All migrants coming from south-east Asia are unqualified. And Muslims only want subsidies. They want to take over Europe – Islamise it.” Not everyone agrees. A few metres from the tuk-tuks’ parking spot, an Indian man who has been working in Albufeira for 10 years shook his head. He worried that a Chega win would make “everything more difficult” for him and others like him. “It’s puzzling to me how the Portuguese, who have emigrated everywhere, are against migration now,” he said. “It wasn’t like this before, but Chega talks and talks and promises everything – impossible things. If Ventura wins and ends up kicking all the migrants out, where will he find the people to work at restaurants and in agriculture?” the man said. For some, however, Sunday can’t come soon enough. “If Chega wins, we’ll take our flags and go in tuk-tuks parading around,” Filipe said. “It’s going to be a party. The Algarve is Chega’s kingdom. The rest of the country will follow.”", "tags": ["portugal", "the", "far", "right", "europe", "news"]},

With a laugh, he added: “It made me question, just what have we done here?” Everyone wanted to speak to him about the same thing; a town council motion, approved unanimously and across party lines, calling on the central government to push forward   to regularise undocumented migrants in Spain. “To us, it was the most natural thing in the world,” explained Núñez Pérez, as he paused to greet residents in the town’s central plaza. In recent decades, migrants from across the globe had been atrracted to Villamalea for the many jobs on offer. The steady supply of labour had helped turn the town into an agricultural heavyweight – about 70% of the mushrooms sold in Spain come from here – while also transforming Villamalea into a rich tapestry of residents whose roots trace back to 32 countries. For the 11 town councillors who backed the motion to grant papers to undocumented migrants – from Núñez Pérez’s People’s party to the Socialists and the United Left – this reality took precedence over party lines. “We didn’t even debate it, we were all onboard right away,” said Núñez Pérez. “There’s a lot of work to be done here. And there could be even more – the problem for these companies is that they can’t find enough people to work.” With the town’s companies weighing up whether to bring in temporary foreign workers, it only made sense to allow those who were already here a fair chance at a foothold. “It’s not just economics, it’s a question of humanity,” said the mayor. In late August, the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde,   in Germany would have been about 6% lower in 2019 if it hadn’t been for foreign workers. The picture was similar across the eurozone, she said. “Although they represented only around 9% of the total labour force in 2022, foreign workers have accounted for half of its growth over the past three years.” In Spain, where the Socialist prime minister   that migration is an opportunity, a surge in arrivals has helped to   among Europe’s plodding economies. Of late, even some of the most ardent critics of immigration have conceded its necessity; in June Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, the far-right leader who  irregular migrants a threat to Europe’s future, said her government   nearly 500,000 new work visas for non-EU nationals in the coming years, in addition to the 450,000 handed out since she took power. While regularisation programmes   across the EU, with 43 put in place by more than a dozen countries between 1996 and 2008, in Villamalea the push to grant papers was also rooted in the town’s history. During much of the 20th century, the town’s residents were forced to fan out across   in search of work, said Venancio Cuenca Lopéz, the head of a local retiree association. “Some of them had papers, but some had no papers, no job offers, nothing,” he said. “We can’t say: ‘Well we did it, but now we’re against it.’ We’re all human beings, we need to have some empathy.” He pushed back against claims that regularisation would push down wages. “There are companies that take advantage of undocumented workers, forcing them to work in poor conditions and paying them little. Then Spaniards can’t work because they’re competing with people who are getting paid peanuts,” he said. “So we regularise them, everyone has the same conditions.” Sign up to  A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion The Guardian spoke to 10 or so residents, all of whom expressed support for the motion. From the pensioners who make up about a quarter of the town’s population to the around 20% who were born abroad – the majority from Morocco or Romania – residents shrugged off the far-right’s efforts to disparage diversity. “Here everyone has their life and their world, but when we get to together we all get along,” said María Anguix García. At Villamalea’s town hall, officials are swift to cite the efforts many have made to foster integration, keenly aware that they’re   of swirling disinformation about migration. “There was a day when people who practise Islam went to the church and got to know the prayer space and then they did the reverse; the Catholics went to the mosque and experienced it,” said the mayor “And around two months later, the five religions we have in Villamalea came together to pray in the church.” When the flood of media requests poured in earlier this year, most wanted to know how Núñez Pérez reconciled his stance with others in the conservative People’s party, particularly as the leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, was   immigration to insecurity. Across the country, PP politicians have entered into governments   the far-right, anti-immigrant Vox party. As a result, PP politicians have lurched further to the right, leading to motions such as the one recently seen in Jumilla, a town of about 27,000 residents, where the PP-led council   in public sports centres that appeared to target Muslims. Núñez Pérez bristled at the comparison. “I’ve always said that I’m not paid by my party, I’m paid by the people of this town,” he said. “In my party, as in all parties, there are differences of opinion. But if you look at the wider picture, we’re not that different.” It was, after all, the PP who had carried out   since Spain returned to democracy. Others in the PP had also followed in Núñez Pérez’s footsteps; in late September, about 20 miles (32km) away in the town of Tarazona de la Mancha, a similar mix of councillors, though headed by a Socialist mayor, had   to unanimously pass their own motion calling on the central government to grant papers to undocumented migrants. Even so, Núñez Pérez knew that the fact that he was a conservative mayor backing regularisation had become a “morbid” fascination for many. “But I think it’s the most natural thing; I know what happens in my town, we live quietly, we live in peace and we learn from each other,” he said. “In interviews they always ask me about my political party. But just because someone fires a shot over there, it doesn’t mean we’re all going to do the same.”", "tags": ["spain", "migration", "europe", "features"]},

The jeopardy facing crucial pollinators was revealed by scientific studies for the  , which found that at least 172 bee species out of 1,928 were at risk of extinction in Europe. The number of butterflies threatened with extinction in Europe has increased from 37 to 65 since the last study, conducted 14 years ago. One species, the   ( ) has now been declared extinct. Beyond their beauty and cultural significance, pollinators like bees and butterflies are lifelines for our health, our food systems and our economies – sustaining the fruits, vegetables and seeds that nourish us,” said Grethel Aguilar, the IUCN director general. “The latest European red list assessments reveal serious challenges, with threats mounting for butterflies and crucial wild bee species.” The causes of the rapid recent declines are the continuing destruction or damage of habitats caused by agricultural intensification and land abandonment, draining wetlands, overgrazing by livestock, and the use of fertilisers and pesticides including  . The fragmentation of pollinator-friendly habitat greatly increases the risk of local extinctions. Global heating is also revealed to be a major threat: 52% of all endangered butterflies in Europe are imperilled by the climate crisis – approximately twice as many as a decade ago. Up to 90% of flowering plants in Europe depend on animal pollination, according to Dr Denis Michez, lead coordinator of the wild bee assessment. “Sadly, wild bee populations are in drastic decline and cannot be easily replaced by managed colonies,” he said. “If wild bees disappear, many wild plants might be at risk too – of which flower-rich meadows and beautiful orchid species are just a few examples.” Fifteen species of bumblebee, which play a crucial role in pollinating peas, beans, peanuts and clover, and 14 species of cellophane bee, known for pollinating trees such as willows and red maples, are now classified as threatened.  , a mining bee unique to the continent and the only species of this genus in Europe, is now assessed as critically endangered – the scientific category closest to extinction in the wild. Butterflies that are only found on mountain tops are particularly vulnerable to global heating as they need to move uphill as their habitats become warmer but eventually run out of space. In southern Spain, the   and the   are among more than 40% of European endemics (only found in Europe) threatened with extinction. In the Mediterranean, species such as the critically endangered   are imperilled by extreme  . Meanwhile, in the Arctic Circle, global heating is causing the tree line to move north by tens of metres each year, with scrub encroaching on bog and tundra. Warmer conditions also mean reindeer can no longer cross the ice to graze Arctic grasslands and keep them open. Eight butterfly species are threatened with extinction in this region, including Freyja’s fritillary and the Arctic ringlet. The biggest habitat for all these pollinators is flower-rich grassland and that is disappearing very fast across Europe because of all these factors,” said Martin Warren, one of the lead coordinators of the butterflies assessment. “The positive thing is that so many people care now and there’s a lot more awareness. Under the  , all member states have to reverse the decline in pollinators by 2030, and they are going to have to start doing something. There are landowners who are interested. Let’s hope they can get the incentives that will help them on their way.” According to Warren, there is “low-hanging fruit” in terms of action for pollinators which won’t reduce food production – and may enhance it – such as farmers creating flower-rich margins around their fields. Jessika Roswall, EU commissioner for environment, water resilience and a competitive circular economy, described the conservation status of wild bees, butterflies and other pollinators as “dire”. Urgent and collective action is needed to tackle this threat. Together with member states, the European Commission has put in place an EU-wide monitoring system for pollinators based on the EU nature restoration regulation, which will help to track our progress. Now, we need to focus on implementation and cooperation with member states to protect our pollinators,” she said.

Videos show Debbie Brockman being violently forced to the ground by two agents before she is handcuffed and put in a van. A local resident filming the incident asks her name while she is face down on the street being handcuffed. “Debbie Brockman,” she replies. “I work for WGN. Please let them know.” In another video, onlookers shout at the agents and call them “fascists”, telling them to “get out of our neighborhood, get out of our city”. The agents get in the van and scrape the side of another car, whose driver is still inside, as they speed off, tearing off part of its bumper. A homeland security official said Brockman stood accused of assaulting a federal law enforcement officer by throwing objects at a vehicle. The incident took place in Chicago’s Lincoln Square neighborhood, as immigration agents – at the behest of   – have been scouring the city for people to deport. The ramped-up immigration enforcement in   has been met with protests. Local resident Nancy Molden told the Chicago Sun-Times that “it was absolutely horrifying” to see Brockman’s arrest in person. “That was the most frightening thing I have seen in Chicago, living here 20-odd years,” Molden said. Witnesses told local media the agents were targeting a small group of landscapers, though that was not immediately confirmed. A second person, a man, also appeared to have been detained. In one video, the man can be seen handcuffed in the back of the vehicle while Brockman is being arrested. The person filming asks him in Spanish for his name. Tricia McLaughlin of the homeland security department said: “US border patrol was conducting immigration enforcement operations and when several violent agitators used their vehicles to block in agents in an effort to impede and assault federal officers. “In fear of public safety and of law enforcement, officers used their service vehicle to strike a suspect’s vehicle and create an opening. As agents were driving, Deborah Brockman, a US citizen, threw objects at border patrol’s car, and she was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer.” WGN   that border patrol had released the employee from federal custody as of 3pm on Friday, and no charges have been filed in her case. The network is still in the process of searching for and obtaining video showing the moment leading up to the employee’s detainment. Brockman’s arrest came days after prosecutors were forced to drop charges against anti-Ice protesters accused of assaulting federal agents while carrying weapons outside a Chicago immigration detention facility – with the move coming after grand jurors refused to hand down an indictment in the case. On Thursday, a federal judge in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order blocking federal agents from using certain forceful tactics to suppress protests or to impede journalists from covering those protests.

Beneath the bustle, it is also home to another taboo-busting pioneer: 49-year-old Adjoua Catherine Tano, a hairdresser who has spent two decades offering mental health advice, or just listening quietly as she cuts her clients’ hair. A school dropout who tried out as a bank cashier before becoming a hairdresser, Tano’s resilience recently came in handy when speaking to a teenager worried about failing their exams. “I told her: ‘Don’t think negatively,’” Tano said. “‘Even if you fail, how can you think that you have failed in life?’” Mental health remains a taboo subject in most parts of Africa, even though according to the World Health Organization more than 116 million people have mental health problems on the continent. Therapy is in critically short supply, with   for every 100,000 people. Across Black communities, hairdressers have become a safe space, especially in communities with little or no access to mental health care – or quality healthcare in general. Bluemind Foundation, a nonprofit organisation working across Cameroon,   and Togo, has plugged into the hairdresser-client relationship through its Heal by Hair initiative. According to its founder, Marie-Alix de Putter, more than 400 hairdressers, including Tano, have been trained in the last two years to act as therapeutic first responders or “mental health ambassadors”, reaching more than 100,000 women. By 2030, de Putter hopes to reach more than 1,000 hairdressers in 20 countries. It began with a love story that turned tragic. In 2012, while the de Putters were on a trip to her native  , her husband was murdered. She became a widow while she was four months pregnant. The case remains unsolved. “I spent my first night as a widow with my hairdresser,” she said. “She was the one I trusted the most that night because you’re just surrounded by people and you don’t know who could have done this … so we had this relationship where every week she would come and do my hair [initially] at home and listen.” Inspired by her personal story, the foundation conducted a 2021 study across seven Francophone countries: 77 % of responders confessed to confiding in their hairdressers, and more than 90% of hairdressers said their clients had sought their counsel. “We just connected the trust that women are already giving to their hairdressers with the tools,” she said. The first training took place in April 2022. The programme is structured around a free, intensive three-day training with psychiatrists and mental health experts who teach the women about active listening, gender-based violence and signs of depression – as well as psychology theories. Afterwards, they are evaluated before receiving a certificate. “The training went very well … I got my diploma and this,” said another hairdresser, Thérèse Gueu, as she reached for a psychology textbook on a shelf in her salon in the working-class neighbourhood of Abobo. Over six months, trainees are supported through peer groups and access to a psychological referral system. When a client shares deeper troubles, hairdressers refer their clients to professional psychologists, or in cases of domestic violence, to the police. Many still bristle at the thought of either, citing financial and societal costs of doing so in a conservative region where one in three people live in extreme poverty. Initially, funding for the programme came mostly from de Putter’s savings, but private donors and agencies like France’s Development Innovation Fund now chip in. Nevertheless, the resources remain small for the amount of work facing the foundation’s small team of 17 paid staff and about 100 volunteers. Their work has yielded stories of joy and healing: in  , one trainee hired someone who had been in a psychiatric hospital, offering social rehabilitation. “Often when you’ve been sick and you’ve been hospitalised, people say you’re crazy,” said de Putter. “So if you have a job and someone who accepts to train you, you get out of the taboo.” One hairdresser left her home because she was a victim of violence, but now helps people. In some communities, hairdressers say a few men have started reaching out for counsel too.

While he had seen a few   carvings in his uncle’s collection of African traditional art, the gift resonated with Adegbola. “I have always been conscious of   but I will say my passionate research was definitely a 2022 moment. “I’ve been collecting them since then,” says Adegbola, who trained as a lawyer in London. “I buy back from foreign auctions and also whenever I find anybody in Nigeria who has them and wants to give them away or get rid of them, I take from them.” The   are a material embodiment of a unique spiritual, cultural and artistic tradition among Yorùbá people, who have   and are more than four times more likely to have them than Europeans. The average birthrate of the Yorùbá town of Igbo-Ora in Nigeria’s Oyo state, is  , compared with a global average of about  . “In Yorùbá culture, twins occupy a position of profound spiritual and social importance,” says Kehinde Adewumi, a researcher at Durban University of Technology who is also a twin.  . “The Yorùbá are reputed to have one of the highest twinning rates in the world, and this phenomenon is interpreted not merely as a biological occurrence but as a sign of divine blessing. “Twins are regarded as bearers of good fortune, prosperity and protection for their families and communities,” he says. “When a twin passes away, carved wooden figures [ ] are created to house the spirit of the departed child, ensuring continued veneration and safeguarding the wellbeing of the living twin and the wider family.” The figures, which are also carved for living twins, were taken care of like real babies: bathed, oiled, breastfed, clothed (in the same dresses as the twins, if alive), adorned with beads, sung and prayed to, and carried on women’s backs. They were carved with stylised features – with bulgy eyes, their cheeks often scarified, and given adult features such as genitalia and breasts. Most importantly, their heads are big and hugely coiffed to symbolise each twin’s spirit, creation and destiny, or  . This tradition, however, has been almost entirely lost. The   figures are scattered in foreign museums all over the world, with the most recent dating from the mid-1950s. So, in February 2023, Adegbola launched   to revitalise the lived history of the tradition. “The Ìbejì Project is an educational and advocacy platform that introduces traditional art to new audiences,” he says. “Twinship is universal, but the Yorùbá response – carving   as vessels for spirits – is unique and must be kept alive as a living conversation rather than frozen in museums abroad.” Sign up to  Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion In October 2024, he curated an   in collaboration with London’s Tafeta Gallery. The project involves collecting original  , exhibiting them and juxtaposing them with curated contemporary art that continues the tradition by exploring the themes of twinness. “I am drawn to artists who seriously engage with what twinship represents: duality, absence, companionship, continuity,” Adegbola says. He believes curating contemporary art works – such as sculptures, installations, paintings or photography – that share artistic and thematic similarities with   resituates the ancient tradition in the present. “[The Ìbejì Project] is a space where contemporary artists create their own responses, extending the dialogue into the present,” he says. “I am most satisfied when people who once dismissed traditional art start to collect it because of the Ìbejì Project,” says Adegbola. Next, he hopes to publish a book “to make the   tradition accessible to scholars and the wider public”. He says: “Though rooted in Yorùbá culture, the Ìbejì Project is for the world. Just as we study other cultures, others should study ours with equal seriousness. “My hope is that they will no longer be seen as museum curiosities, but as part of a living, breathing cultural heritage.”", "tags": ["global", "development", "nigeria", "art", "sculpture", "africa", "features"]},

The subject is none other than his cousin Rodrigue, who is consumed with a weighty secret: both he and his wife Reine are living with Aids. Within their deeply religious community, the condition is sorely misunderstood; in his fervid sermons, the local pastor associates Aids and HIV with witchcraft, curses, and even God’s punishment. Such superstitious and moralistic sentiments take deep root in the minds of the believers, worsening the social stigma surrounding an ongoing health crisis. Unable to speak their truth, Rodrigue and Reine are torn between their private troubles and public personas. The sensorial soundmix powerfully conjures the cacophony of voices that envelop their daily existence. Religious preaching, received with thunderous applause merges with the twittering of rumours and gossip, along with various community quarrels. In this town, words are never just words. Rendered tactile through editing, they become the ties that bind Rodrigue and Reine to their secret. Amid this atmosphere of conservatism, the couple only find relief when they are on their own. As Rodrigue’s illnesses worsen, the cinematography lends a tableaux quality to their acts of care. Reine tends to her husband with moving tenderness, and their humble home is transformed into a safe haven for two restless souls. While the film touches on the economic and medical obstacles that hamper Aids treatment in the CAR, in focusing on this personal relationship the film emphasises that the existing hurdles are more than material. For those like Rodrigue and Reine to be freed from their burden, meaningful changes need to start from a place of empathy.

Trump and Zelenskyy discussed Ukraine’s request for the US to allow the delivery of Tomahawk cruise missiles to bolster Kyiv’s ability to conduct long-range strikes inside Russia, among other issues, according to  . This follows Trump’s suggestion that he had “sort of made a decision” about selling Tomahawks to Nato countries in order for them to be supplied to  . “If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well – including the Russian war,” Zelenskyy wrote on Facebook, a day after Moscow launched a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure that triggered widespread blackouts in Kyiv and elsewhere. “I informed President Trump about Russia’s attacks on our energy system – and I appreciate his willingness to support us,” Zelenskyy said on X, adding that they had a “very positive and productive” discussion on “concrete agreements” for strengthening Ukraine’s air defences. The phone call took place amid mounting concern in Kyiv over both the increasing scale of Russian air attacks and Ukraine’s ability to counter ever more sophisticated aerial assaults involving hundreds of drones at a time, and more effective Russian countermeasures against Kyiv’s air defences. The commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, warned that Russia was stepping up its air raids. “New challenges await us ahead. Over the past month, the enemy has increased the number of air attack weapons and although our air defence is about 74% effective, we need to make additional efforts to cover the rear energy sector, critical infrastructure and logistics,” said Syrskyi. Earlier this week, Russia launched 465 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones, as well as 32 cruise and ballistic missiles, against Ukraine. The latest talks between Trump and Zelenskyy come amid ongoing discussions in Washington over whether to provide Ukraine with the Tomahawk cruise missiles Kyiv has long been seeking, a move Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has warned would be a “completely new, qualitatively new stage of escalation”. The phone call between the two leaders comes amid a warming of relations between the US president and Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president said in his nightly address on Friday that Russia was taking advantage of the world being “almost entirely focused on the prospect of establishing peace in the Middle East”, and called for strengthening Ukraine’s air defence systems and tighter sanctions on Russia. “Russian assets must be fully used to strengthen our defence and ensure recovery,” he said in the video, posted to X. Meanwhile, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a joint statement on Friday they were ready to coordinate and move toward using “the value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s armed forces and thus bring Russia to the negotiation table”.

Over the past two years, outrage at Israel’s war in Gaza has erupted across   and the US, manifesting itself in university campus protests, massive marches through countless capitals and the disruption of major sporting events. Even as hopes rise of an end to the war, international anger over Israel’s actions in Gaza, which have been deemed a  , remains raw, as evidenced by last weekend’s  . While the fury that fuels them has been shared and ubiquitous, the demonstrations – and the authorities’ responses to them – have varied considerably from country to country. If some of the official reactions have been draconian, there have also been exceptions, especially in countries where public opinion is more openly pro-Palestinian. In the  , growing pro-Palestinian activism has been met with arrests, legal action and mounting threats, offering   for the Trump administration’s unprecedented attack on free speech and catalysing what many view as the country’s descent into authoritarianism. In the early months of the war, thousands of people, many of them  , took part in protests. After students at Columbia University set up a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus in the spring of 2024, dozens more followed at other universities across the country. But bowing to pressure from legislators, donors, and pro-Israel critics, many universities responded harshly to the encampments, calling police on to campuses, which led to  . Meanwhile, allegations of antisemitism against pro-Palestinian protests have been weaponised by the Trump administration to launch an unprecedented  , including cutting billions in funding to universities, screening thousands of visa applicants for pro-Palestinian views, and the detention and   of foreign scholars over their political views. In the  , the Metropolitan police have so far arrested more than 1,900 people at pro-Palestinian events, the vast majority of whom have been detained for allegedly expressing support for  , a direct action group that has been proscribed under anti-terrorism legislation. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for the  , describing it as “disproportionate and unnecessary”. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, who described plans for protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel as  , has said his government will look at  , including potential powers to take action against specific chants at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Starmer also urged protesters to show respect by calling off their activities in the  , in which two people died. In  , whose postwar identity has been indelibly shaped by the Nazi regime’s responsibility for the Holocaust, the protests have revealed tensions between popular feeling and the country’s longstanding solidarity with  . Even as   – a recent pro-Palestinian rally in Berlin attracted about   – successive German governments have reaffirmed the principle that responsibility for Israel’s security is part of Berlin’s own Staatsräson or reason of state. Activists have repeatedly said that police tactics have been excessive, at times brutal, and in violation of constitutional protections of freedom of assembly and expression. Much of the dispute between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and German authorities has centred around which slogans are banned under the law as antisemitic. In May last year, a pro-Palestinian activist was convicted of condoning a crime for using the chant, “from the river to the sea,   will be free”, at a rally four days after the 7 October attacks. The judge said she “could not comprehend” the logic of previous German court rulings that determined the saying was “ambiguous”, and that, to her, it was clear it “denied the right of the state of Israel to exist”. This chant however has   both in Israel and Palestine. When asked about crackdowns on pro-Palestinian activism after  , Berlin police this month said they had opened an investigation into the officer but denied a pattern of violence or infringement of civil rights. Artists and intellectuals have cited a   in Germany around support for the Palestinian cause since the 7 October attacks, as criticism of Israeli tactics in Gaza can be quickly smeared as antisemitism, resulting in the withdrawal of prizes, positions and public funding. Meanwhile, many Jewish leaders in Germany have described a sense of isolation over the last two years and point to  . In May this year,  ’s   announced it would dissolve the pro-Palestinian human rights and solidarity collective, Urgence Palestine, stating that it condoned Hamas, called for intifada in France, and provoked hatred, violence and discrimination against Jewish people. Urgence Palestine has contested these allegations, saying that the move to dissolve it is politically motivated and part of a wider crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism. The collective has not yet been dissolved. Marie Laure Geoffray, freedoms advocacy officer for Amnesty International  , said there had been “significant repression and a silencing of voices in solidarity with Palestine” and that this was ongoing. She said it had taken various forms in France, including the banning of some street demonstrations in certain cities, the decision to dissolve Urgence Palestine, as well as legal action. Geoffray said students on French campuses had also been accused of disrupting the peace or troubling the public order. In  , the extent of   became evident on 22 September, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets calling for an end to the conflict as part of   coordinated by trade unions. The mostly peaceful event was overshadowed by clashes between police and masked protesters at Milan’s central train station, giving the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, an opportunity to condemn the “shameful” scenes and attack her leftwing opponents rather than show solidarity with the Palestinians. The pressure on Meloni increased further when Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla triggered protests across Italy nine days later. Rome’s police said at least 250,000 people turned out for a march, which came a day after   took part in a one-day general strike to support Palestinians in Gaza. Meloni’s government is mindful of public opinion, and in recent months has become increasingly critical of Israel’s killing of Palestinians – even as Italy remains one of Israel’s strongest EU allies. Meloni now says Italy would recognise a Palestinian state if the remaining Israeli hostages were freed and the militant group   was out of government. In  , which joined Spain and Norway in formally recognising a Palestinian state in May 2024, the police force, An Garda Síochána, has mostly applied a light touch to Gaza protests, which usually pass without incident. Government   and   are strongly  , which creates a supportive atmosphere for marches and rallies. “Overall it’s kind of hands-off policing,” said Zoë Lawlor, the chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. “National demonstrations pass off fine. In Limerick we have a demonstration every week and we never see the Garda unless the far right show up too. Otherwise we just steward ourselves.” Police have on occasion been “heavy-handed” when dealing with sit-ins and other acts of civil disobedience but that did not compare with the “shocking” police behaviour in some other countries, said Lawlor. Ireland enjoyed greater freedom to protest than in countries such as the UK, US and Germany, but Irish policing still required monitoring, said Joe O’Brien, the executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. “We have heard testimony, including allegations of unnecessary strip-searches and a cavity search, that raises serious concerns regarding Garda compliance with human rights frameworks and national law, regulations and policies governing the treatment of people in custody.” In May, the then Garda commissioner, Drew Harris, said allegations of strip-searches were inaccurate and that his force at all times had acted professionally and lawfully. Similarly,   has proved something of an exception when it comes to government support for protests. Not long after more than 100,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators   to the Vuelta a España cycle race in Madrid last month, due to the  , senior Spanish politicians lined up to bemoan the damage the protest had done to the country’s global reputation. Figures in the conservative People’s party called the episode “an international embarrassment” and compared scenes on the streets of Madrid to “Sarajevo during the war”. But one political figure took a different line. Spain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he had   for all those who had protested in a non-violent manner and for “a Spanish society that mobilises against injustice and defends its ideas in a peaceful manner”. Sánchez, who had already been fiercely criticised by his adversaries, also said he hoped the events in Madrid would lead others to reconsider whether Israel should be included in major sporting events. Last weekend, an estimated 200,000 people rallied across dozens of cities to show their solidarity with Palestine. Both the protests and the prime minister’s backing for them demonstrate the strength of public opinion in a country where, according to  , 82% of people believe Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Sánchez’s conservative opponents have also recently begun to step up their  , while King Felipe – hardly a habitual courter of controversy – used a speech before the UN last month to beg   to “stop the massacre” and end its “abhorrent acts” in Gaza.", "tags": ["protest", "gaza", "palestine", "spain", "ireland", "italy", "france", "news"]},

{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/08/nigerian-modernism-review-tate-modern-london", "content": "ubtitled Art and Independence, Nigerian Modernism is a complicated, contrary exhibition, tracing the development of modern art in   from the period of British colonial rule to the end of the 20th century. Focusing on individual artists and on various artists’ groups, it attempts a history of movements and of alliances in a country that has been both factionalised and divided by language and belief, religious and ethnic divisions, by the traumas of colonisation and of civil war. The sweep of Nigerian history, even over the past century or so, is too big and too complicated to be charted through the lens of the country’s art. What can modernism possibly mean here, especially from our position at the end of the first quarter of the 21st century? European-style academic portraiture, including paintings by Aina Onabolu and by Akinola Lasekan, who also depicted Yoruba acrobatic dancers and mythic scenes, jostle with a pair of 1910-14 carved wooden door panels, depicting a British officer, carried in some sort of sedan chair, with shackled prisoners carrying his possessions, to be received by the Ogoga – or king – of Ikere. The officer looks, inadvertently, like a little homunculus on a bier. Nearby photographs, by Jonathan Adagogo Green, one of Africa’s first professional photographers, show the king of Benin, deposed in the  , shackled on board a British yacht, on his way into exile. The photographer is complicit in this scene, and in others where he was hired to photograph similarly deposed local rulers, dressed in all their finery. All this is so much scene-setting. We jump to Ben Enwonwu (1917-94), who was described by the late curator and critic Okwui Enwezor as “arguably Africa’s first art star”. His tall, carved figures, commissioned by the Daily Mirror in 1960, the year of Nigerian independence, are a group of men and women reading newspapers, which seem to mysteriously transmogrify into wings. The readers are variously astonished and transfixed. Enwonwu’s career as sculptor, painter and art educator wasremarkably varied. He painted the celebration of Eid and flamboyantly costumed ritual dancers; he sculpted a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and made sinuous watercolours of silhouetted, naked dancing women, titling them Black Culture and Negritude (these, I think, have been a reference for British Nigerian artist Chris Ofili). Versions of Enwonwu’s sculpture Anyanwu, depicting an Igbo mythological figure, stand outside the Nigerian National Museum and at the UN building in New York. The small version here is in the Royal Collection. Enwonwu’s skill was, I think, mostly graphic, whatever his medium. It is also easy to get mired in the sociology of groups of artists included here, though it is probably an unavoidable rubric. In 1960 a group of rebellious art students, rejecting the limited Eurocentric curriculum they’d been taught, first formed the Zaria   Society – to whom a room is devoted – and moved to south-western Nigeria to co-found the Mbari Club of artists and writers alongside German publisher Ulli Beier. Aesthetics and contingency both played their part. Many of the works in this close-hung room are very much of their period. There’s a flavour of the late 1950s, many of the artists favouring a kind of semi-abstracted, often tortured figuration not so removed from the kinds of things their counterparts in the UK were doing at the time, though some had more urgency and purpose. Uche Okeke painted a monstrous bloated amphibian, and a genuinely nasty depiction of a Christian convert sacrilegiously unmasking an Igbo ceremonial dancer. Okeke’s raw and violent paintings of this time are matched by Demas Nwoko’s Nigeria in 1959 which shows three white colonial officers sitting together in great unease. Behind them loom five Nigerian soldiers, servants of the state, their faces shadowed and menacing in the gloom, Nigerian acolytes who imagined they had immense powers, whereas they had no aim and future. Until, of course, they found others to serve. The painting is like a premonition. Large-scale photos of 1960s European modernist architecture are pasted to the wall in a section devoted to post-independence Lagos. Nearby hang a few Highlife album covers, while a playlist by DJ Peter Adjaye, is piped, too quietly, into the gallery. More could have been made of this. Meant as an evocation of cosmopolitan energy, the room itself is anything but jumping, in the same way that Tate Modern’s celebration of post-independence Lagos in its opening 2001 exhibition Century City failed to capture the city’s vitality, while also soundtracking the show with Highlife music and featuring the same photographs – by JD ’Okhai Ojeikere – of women sporting astonishingly sculptural hairstyles. We take a quick respite in the sacred groves of Osun, near Osogbo, where Austrian-born artist, Yoruba priestess and senior member of the Ogboni cult Susanne Wenger (1915-2009) worked with local craftspeople and artists for more than 40 years to restore and extend the traditional reserve of deities, and set up what is called the New Sacred Art Movement. At Tate Modern, a group of diminutive sculpted figures sit on a low, green platform against the backdrop of a black and white photograph of part of the shrine at Osun, now a Unesco World Heritage site. The overall effect is deeply underwhelming. More interesting is the work of the Oshogbo School, based in Osogbo , a melting pot of cultures and beliefs, and now a centre for the Yoruba religion. Yoruba mythology and culture were at the heart of artist and musician Twins Seven Seven’s work. This guy had a remarkable life and is owed a biography; his complex, dense paintings, peopled by spirits and ghosts and fearsome creatures are electrifying. In one etching, heaving with pattern and swarming cityscapes of the imagination, he clutches at the city entwined in his fingers. It is called In the Palm of an Architect. A reading of Come Thunder, by poet Christopher Okigbo, who died fighting as a volunteer for Biafra during a battle with Nigerian forces in 1967, fills the penultimate room of the show. “The smell of blood already floats in the lavender mist of the afternoon,” Okigbo wrote. “The death sentence lies in ambush along the corridors of power…” It is hard to listen to the verses, repeated on loop, as one goes from painting to painting, object to object. Terrors and tremors are threaded through Nigerian Modernism, along with conflicting aspirations and the mess of history. Obiora Udechukwu’s monumental and strange 1993 work Our Journey, with its little figures, gatherings and events inscribed, faintly, on an unfurling spiral of yellow paint that crosses an otherwise almost abstract swooning fields of colour, punctuated by disruptions, sheerings and symbols, is full of questions and intrigue. The drawn, the painted and the symbolic are in constant flux. Now in his 70s, Udechukwu is worth a room of his own here, but the final gallery is devoted to the paintings of Uzo Egonu (1931-96), who moved to the UK as a teenager. He returned to Nigeria only once, for two days, in the 1970s. Buses traverse Piccadilly Circus, as though seen in a fish-eye lens. People sit alone, reading. There’s some sort of clamour in a crowded room and people tussling with a ladder. Egonu’s paintings have an anxious sinister calm. His figures, imprisoned by geometry and oddly static, exist in a painted modernity that seems to defy any particular place or moment. The modern is inescapable. It is an oddly abrupt ending to an unfinished story.   .  This article was amended on 9 October 2025. An earlier version misidentified the late Aina Onabolu as female.

She added that sentencing would take place at a later date. Korner detailed harrowing accounts of gang rapes, abuse and mass killing. She said that on one occasion, Abd-al-Rahman loaded about 50 civilians on to trucks, beating some with axes, before making them lie on the ground and ordering his troops to shoot them dead. “The accused was not only giving orders … but was personally involved in the beatings and later was physically present and giving orders for the execution of those detained,” said the ICC judge. Prosecutors had accused Abd-al-Rahman of being a leading member of Sudan’s infamous Janjaweed militia, which participated “enthusiastically” in war crimes. But Abd-al-Rahman, who was born around 1949, has denied all the charges, telling the court they had the wrong man. “I am not Ali Kushayb. I do not know this person … I have nothing to do with the accusations against me,” he told the court at a hearing in December 2024.

Fighting broke out in the Darfur region when non-Arab tribes, complaining of systematic discrimination, took up arms against Khartoum’s Arab-dominated government. The then Sudanese government responded by unleashing the Janjaweed, a force drawn from among the region’s nomadic tribes. The United Nations has said that 300,000 people were killed and that 2.5 million others displaced by the Darfur conflict in the 2000s. During the trial, the ICC chief prosecutor said Abd-al-Rahman and his forces “rampaged across different parts of Darfur”. He “inflicted severe pain and suffering on women, children and men in the villages that he left in his wake”, said Karim Khan, who has since stepped down as he faces allegations of sexual misconduct. Abd-al-Rahman is also thought to be an ally of the deposed Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the ICC on genocide charges. Bashir, who ruled Sudan with an iron fist for nearly three decades, was ousted and detained in April 2019 after months of protests in Sudan. He has not, however, been handed over to the ICC, based in The Hague, where he also faces charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. ICC prosecutors are hoping to issue fresh arrest warrants related to the current crisis in Sudan. Since 2023, tens of thousands have been killed and millions displaced in a war between Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which grew out of the Janjaweed militia. The conflict, marked by claims of atrocities on all sides, has left the north-east African country on the brink of famine, according to aid agencies.", "tags": ["darfur", "international", "criminal", "court", "international", "criminal", "justice", "sudan", "africa", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "news"]},

She was in labour, in extreme pain after her uterus ruptured, but was now being tossed around in the ambulance that jumped along the dips and bumps of the road through the Chadian desert. Most of the   since 2023, living hand to mouth in this harsh landscape, are women. They stay in isolated camps in the desert with limited water and food, no work and with medical help often a life-threateningly long distance away. The hospital Mohammed needed, run by the aid agency   (MSF), was in Metche, another refugee camp more than two hours away. “I kept getting infections during my pregnancy and I had to go the clinic seven times – when I was there, the pregnancy started. But I wasn’t able to give birth normally because my uterus had collapsed,” says Mohammed. “I had to wait two hours for the ambulance but all I remember was the pain; it was so bad I became delirious.” Her mother, Ashe Khamis Abdullah, 40, feared she would lose both her daughter and baby grandson. But Mohammed was rushed straight into surgery when she arrived at the hospital and an emergency caesarean section saved her and her son, Muwais. Chad already had the world’s second-highest maternal mortality rate before the current influx of refugees, but the conditions endured by the Sudanese put even more women in danger. At the MSF hospital, where they have delivered 824 babies in mostly emergency conditions this year, the medics are able to save many, but it is what happens to the women who are not able to reach the hospital that concerns them. In the two years since the civil war in Sudan began,  . In total, about 1.2 million Sudanese are being hosted in the eastern part of the country, 400,000 of whom fled the previous conflict in Darfur. Chad has taken the lion’s share of the  ; others have gone to South Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia. A total of 11.8 million Sudanese have been displaced from their homes. Many men have stayed behind to be close to homes and land; others have been killed, taken hostage or forced into fighting. Those of working age move on quickly from Chad’s desolate refugee camps to find work in the capital, N’Djamena, or further, in neighbouring Libya. it means women are left alone, without the means to feed the children and the elderly left in their care. To avoid overcrowding near the border, the Chadian government has relocated people to smaller camps such as Metche with average populations of about 50,000, but in remote areas with no services and few opportunities. Metche has a hospital built by MSF, which started off as a few tents but has expanded to include an operating theatre, but little else. There is no work, families must walk hours to find firewood, and each person must survive on about   a day – far below the  . This isolation means hospitals are receiving women with complications in their pregnancy dangerously late. There is only a single ambulance to cover the route between the Metche hospital and the clinic near the  , where Mohammed is one of nearly 50,000 refugees. The MSF team has seen cases where women in desperate pain have had to wait an entire night for the ambulance to arrive. As well as being rough, the route passes through valleys that flood during the rainy season, completely cutting off travel. Alejandrina Cripovic, a surgeon at MSF’s hospital in Metche, said every case she sees is an emergency, with some women having to make long and difficult journeys to the hospital by foot or on a donkey. “Imagine being nine months pregnant, in labour, and travelling hours on a cart pulled by a donkey to get to a hospital. The biggest factor is the delay but having to come in these conditions also has an impact on the birth,” says Cripovic. Malnutrition, which is on the rise, also increases the   in pregnancy, including the uterine ruptures that MSF staff see regularly. Mohammed has remained in hospital in the two months since her caesarean. Suffering from malnutrition, she developed an infection, while her son has been carefully monitored. The father has travelled to other towns in search of work, so Mohammed is completely reliant on her mother. The malnutrition ward has expanded to six tents and has patients spilling over into other sections. Children lie under mosquito nets in sweltering heat in almost complete silence as medical staff work, preparing treatments and weighing children on a scale made from a bucket and rope. In mild cases children get sachets of PlumpyNut, the specially formulated peanut paste, but the worst cases need a regular intake of enriched milk. Mohammed’s baby is fed his through a syringe. Suhayba Abdullah Abubakar’s 11-month-old boy, Sufian Sulaiman, is being fed through a nasal drip. The infant has been ill for the past year but Abubakar was repeatedly given only painkillers without any diagnosis, until she made the journey from Alacha to Metche. “Every day, I see more children joining us in this tent,” she says. “The food we’re eating is poor, there’s not enough to eat and it’s not nutritious. “If we were at home, we could’ve adapted ourselves. You can go and grow crops, you can work to earn some money, but here we’re reliant on what we’re given.” And what they are given is a small amount of sorghum, cooking oil and salt, handed out every two months. Such a basic diet lacks nutrition, and the little cash she is given cannot buy much in the weekly food markets, where prices have become inflated. Abubakar was relocated to Alacha after arriving from Sudan in 2023, having fled the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces’ attack on her home city of El Geneina in June that year.

She lives with his relatives, sharing out whatever food they can get. Abubakar says she has already seen food distributions being reduced and there are concerns that the abrupt cuts in overseas aid budgets by the US, UK and other European countries, could make things worse. Despite the war in Sudan having created the 21st century’s   and the scale of needs of the refugees continuing to arrive, only   in 2024.

Azza Dahiye Osman, 65, is weaving dried palm leaves into items she can sell at the market. Some of the others sell small bags of peanuts, or get work from local farmers, but often end up being exploited and not paid. They all have their own stories of hardship. One woman miscarried after she was turned away by health clinics, despite the pain she was in. Osman suffers from hypertension but says there is no treatment for chronic diseases in the camps until the illness reaches an emergency stage. “So if I have diabetes or hypertension, do I have to die to get treated?” she says. “I have searched and searched and searched for help but I cannot even get the medicine I need.” Osman left Sudan two years ago, fleeing the  , the first city in the Darfur region to fall to the paramilitaries. Now in Metche, people are anxious for news of the  , the last city in Darfur still resisting the rebels. The RSF claims it is pushing back against the Sudanese government, which it says is made up of elites who have long ignored the marginalised. “They are liars; there’s nothing to believe,” says Osman. “They are the ones who killed us – we cannot live under them.” RSF control of Darfur, and the parallel government it has established there, means no going back for the refugees in Chad. It is a bleak prospect. There are few jobs on offer for young men, just local brickfields or in northern Chad’s goldmines. So most leave to try their luck further afield. Afaf Abdulmalik, 21, feels she will have to move soon. She left behind a comfortable life and a government job in El Fasher in 2023, after her brother-in-law was killed in front of his family during the RSF’s first failed attempts to take the city. Her older brother and sister remain in El Fasher but she has not heard from them and does not know whether they are alive. Her life is focused on the daily survival of her elderly mother, sister and young niece, searching for water and firewood. There is no schooling available for her niece, who is still traumatised by her father’s killing. The UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR,   that aid cuts by international donors have threatened secondary education programmes and could mean 155,000 out of school by next year. The teenager saw her father shot in front of her by RSF fighters, who used to raid their neighbourhood on motorbikes, killing and kidnapping the residents. “We cannot forget what we saw there,” says Abdulmalik. “My niece still freezes if she sees a man on a motorbike.” But she has also tried to cultivate a little joy: the family’s shelter is surrounded by plants, mostly vegetables but also flowers that remind them of a Sudan in bloom with lemon trees and pomegranates. The garden has taken time – she cannot buy seeds so Abdulmalik takes cuttings of plants she comes across while she goes about her daily tasks and brings them home. To see her work flourish, she had to wait for the recent rainy season. “Sometimes in the morning I take a cup of tea and stand in the garden, it gives me some happiness; it helps me remember life before the war and forget everything that’s happened,” she says. “I get this feeling for a moment that maybe everything will be OK.”", "tags": ["chad", "aid", "cuts", "sudan", "refugees", "africa", "middle", "east", "and", "north", "africa", "conflict", "and", "arms", "women", "(society)", "features"]},
{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/colombian-mercenaries-sudan-war", "content": "For   mercenaries hardened by decades of jungle warfare, Sudan’s conflict seemed slow at first. “In Sudan, they spend the night sleeping – they don’t even have security because everyone goes to bed,” said Carlos, one of hundreds of Colombians hired to fight in the African country. “Colombians are different – we are used to a different kind of war.” So when Carlos and his comrades reached the front, they pressed on through the darkness, driving deeper into enemy territory. “And then there began to be much more fighting – and many more deaths,” he said. Carlos arrived in   earlier this year, almost two years into the country’s brutal civil war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict has plunged Sudan into one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history  :   have been killed, women and girls have been abducted and   and nearly   have been forced to flee their homes, in the world’s worst displacement crisis. About 260,000 people remain trapped in El Fasher, North Darfur’s capital and the army’s last major stronghold in the Darfur region, which has been  . Aid has not entered the ravaged city for nearly   and children have been reduced to eating locusts and animal feed. It is there that the Colombians, fighting for the RSF, have now been dispatched. “War is a business,” said Carlos. The mercenaries’ involvement first emerged last year, when an investigation by the Bogotá-based outlet   found that more than 300 former soldiers had been contracted to fight – prompting an unprecedented apology by Colombia’s foreign ministry. But the Colombians’ role has gone beyond the battlefield: fighters have admitted to   and have been pictured operating in Zamzam, the   in Sudan. In April, the RSF tore through Zamzam, killing between 300 and 1,500 people – the UN called it one of the worst   of the war. Mohamed Khamis Douda, a spokesman for the camp in Darfur, recently told the  : “We have witnessed with our own eyes a dual crime: the displacement of our people at the hands of the RSF militia, and now the occupation of the camp by foreign mercenaries.” The United Arab Emirates – long accused of arming and backing the RSF – has been blamed for hiring the mercenaries, via private security firms. The UAE has consistently denied these allegations. Unlike some Colombian whistleblowers who claim they were told they would be guarding oil facilities in the UAE, Carlos knew he was bound for war, though only that it was in  . His journey began with medical examinations in Bogotá, where he signed a $2,600-a-month contract. Afterwards he was flown via Europe to Ethiopia, and then to an Emirati military base in Bosaso, Somalia, he said. Later he was taken to Nyala in Sudan, a city now notorious as the hub for Colombian mercenaries. Carlos, who requested anonymity to speak freely, admitted that his first task was training Sudanese recruits, most of whom were children. “The camps had thousands of recruits, some adults, but mostly children – lots and lots of children,” he said. “These are children who have never held a weapon. We taught them how to handle assault rifles and machine guns, RPGs. After that, they were sent to the front. We were training them to go and get killed.” He describes training the children as “awful and crazy” but said that “unfortunately that’s how war is”. Carlos’s unit was eventually posted to the besieged El Fasher, the country’s worst battleground. RSF fighters have built a 20-mile wall around the  , and executed those trying to flee. Carlos shared photos and videos – some passed on by his comrades – with La Silla Vacía and the Guardian, showing Colombian mercenaries in Sudan. One picture shows trainees lying prone on the ground, some holding rifles. Two teenagers pose for the camera, making a victory sign with their fingers. In one video, a man can be seen shooting a machine gun through a hole in the wall of a ruined apartment. In a clip shared by a different Colombian mercenary, a man loads and fires a mortar at a location geolocated in the outskirts of El Fasher. In another video, filmed amid heavy gunfire, mercenaries with thick Colombian accents discuss a colleague who appears to have been wounded. “I don’t know if he’s dead, because we couldn’t see him,” one says in Spanish. “Who else is going to help get him out?” The mercenary points to a group of Sudanese fighters milling around nearby. “You, you, you. You can help us here, support these men. We’re going to retreat quietly, to get this guy out,” he says, before the group carry a wounded man past houses peppered with bullet holes. Colombia’s own decades-long civil conflict has created a surplus of experienced fighters, many of whom received training from the US army, and the country is believed to be one of the largest exporters of mercenaries. “Colombia has more than a half-century of history of active conflict. Its soldiers have not only been trained very well, but have been in the field, in very difficult situations, and so are combat ready,” says Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for Colombia at International Crisis Group. Sean McFate, an expert on mercenaries, says the use of Colombian mercenaries escalated around the 2010s, when ex-combatants were paid to guard oil infrastructure in the UAE. Their role evolved during the war in Yemen. “The UAE sent a lot of Colombian mercenaries to go and kill the Houthi [rebels] and they were successful in that,” he says. Since then, Colombian soldiers of fortune have appeared regularly in the headlines: in July 2021  . Colombian ex-military personnel have also fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and now Ukraine. In November of last year, Colombia’s foreign minister said that approximately   had travelled to fight against Russian forces. Carlos is one of those, having served two years with the Ukrainian troops. “Ukraine was becoming more complicated, there were more casualties, more enemy advances. So I left and took on this mercenary job in Africa instead,” he says. “I knew absolutely nothing about it – only that it was in Africa.” McFate says mercenaries give countries “good plausible deniability”, in cases where they want to skirt international law or have a strategy of human rights violations. “When they get captured or killed, you disavow them,” he says. The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, has described mercenarism as a “trade in men turned into commodities to kill” and has  . But former fighters often struggle to reintegrate into Colombian society, and the cash incentives they are offered mean the business is unlikely to end soon. Both Dickinson and McFate argued that the problem also lay with Colombia’s military system: most professional soldiers are forced to retire around 40, with low pensions and few retraining options. “If you enter at 18 and work 20 years, you’re not even 40 when you retire. You have 15, 20 years left of active duty time,” said Dickinson. “The support structure for the Colombian retired military is deficient, particularly compared to the offer that’s on the table from these organisations.” But Dickinson also warns that the “ecosystem of private defence companies” is no longer limiting itself to retired soldiers. “Defence companies are increasingly recruiting those on active duty, from places where soldiers have a really hard time in difficult conditions,” said Dickinson. “They send WhatsApp pamphlets offering thousands of dollars a month.” For the military, this is an “enormous loss”, she said. “The Colombian government trains them to a very high level – and then they are essentially stolen by the private defence industry.” Carlos is one of those who left the armed forces after just over five years of service. He has also left Sudan, blaming issues with payment. He said 30 men quit alongside him, but “at the same time, flights with 30 more were arriving”. Mercenaries almost disappeared from the world’s battlefields for most of the 20th century, but the business was growing fast again, said McFate. “It’s the world’s oldest profession,” he says. “We’re returning to something medieval, where the super-rich can become like superpowers.” Carlos took a similarly dark view of his trade. “This isn’t an honest job; it’s not a legal job. But you go for money,” he said.", "tags": ["sudan", "africa", "colombia", "americas", "features"]},

I had this question in mind when I attended a private viewing of Tate Modern’s new exhibition, Nigerian  , which traces artwork from the period of indirect colonial rule to post-independence. Walking through the gallery with the curator Osei Bonsu, learning about the incredible ways in which modern Nigerian artists sought to define, shape and rebel against the beautiful but contested state, I found answers. Osei Bonsu, the curator of international art at Tate Modern alongside assistant curator Bilal Akkouche, tells me that Nigerian Modernism is around three years in the making, though his initial research began as early as the Covid pandemic. “I was able to research the collections of the Universities of Birmingham, York and Chichester, all of which have really rich African collections.” He found that modern Nigerian artists were often categorised within ideas of “traditional” African art, which he felt decontextualised the work and severed its links to modernity. Many of the artists in Nigerian Modernism grappled with this question of cultural nationalism and identity, which had been shaped as much by interactions with European colonial culture as by their heritage. This was an especially pressing question in the build up to independence in 1960. That is immediately apparent in the first room of the exhibition, which features the work of the modern arts teacher and painter Aina Onabolu. Bonsu draws my attention to his 1922 oil painting of an elite Lagosian woman, Charlotte Obasa: “Commissioning her portrait was a way of signifying her wealth and importance within Lagosian society. If you look at her dress and how she’s framed, there’s a sense of the British upper class.” Portraiture was a kind of artistic realism that helped define class structures. But realist art also served more democratic purposes. Akinola Lasekan, a student of Onabolu’s, took a very different approach to painting. “Instead of engaging in the honorific language of portraiture, he was more invested in portraying scenes of everyday life, but also scenes of Nigerian mythology,” Bonsu explains. In Onabolu’s works, we see watercolour paintings of Hausa traders at Lagos market, as well as a depiction of the creation story through Obatala, the orisha who descended from the sky to create the Earth. “You could say these artists were revolting against the grain of Christian missionary culture that discouraged the representation of daily Nigerian realities.” Being half Bini (the ethnic group of Nigerian descendants of the Benin empire), I am especially interested in a vitrine containing photographs by Jonathan Adagogo Green, which depicts Ovonramwen, the Oba of Benin, just after the sacking of his kingdom in 1897. Bonsu included such work because they provide “a mini retrospective of his photographic practice that was, at the time, interested in traditional rules, and these transitions of power”. Though he notes that Green was employed by the British colonial government and operated as a double agent, representing both traditional Nigerian culture and the sweeping changes of colonial rule. These changes are also recorded in one of the exhibition’s most remarkable acquisitions: a panel of doors by the sculptor and innovator of Yoruba visual language Olowe of Ise, which was gifted to the British Museum. The carving depicts a meeting between the ogoga (king) of Ikere and a colonial officer, Captain William Ambrose. Bonsu says: “We often think about traditional Yoruba carving as being used to represent honorific dynastic culture. But this spoke to a social critique and depicted the captain as a supplicant of the king, which in a sense used sculpture to politicise a national event.” Despite this exploration of colonial relations, you won’t find stolen  here, or any other plundered art. “It was important to start where that narrative leaves off,” Bonsu explains. “These are the artists who emerge on the other side of that violence, grappling with a loss of tradition and trying to relocate forms and techniques.” One of the show’s stars is the sculptor and painter Ben Enwonwu, who is often described as the most influential African artist of the 20th century. His work Negritude is the lead promotional image for the exhibition; it depicts a woman dancing, and in the galleries I find a series of similar pieces. Bonsu explains that these were inspired by Enwonwu’s attendance of the legendary Nigerian nightclub Caban Bamboo: “You can see he’s trying to catch movement through the brushstrokes, and the layering of limbs to depict the performance of dance in a painterly form.” There is technical brilliance in Enwonwu’s work, but he is also an interesting study in contradiction. One of his most famous sculptures is, in fact, of Queen Elizabeth, commissioned to inaugurate a state visit she made to Nigeria in 1956. “He’s heralding this arrival of a newly independent Nigeria,” Bonsu says. “But he’s also embodying a lot of the virtues of the Commonwealth through his presence as a Black artist who received a great deal of privilege and access.” Even where Enwonwu depicted Nigeria’s struggles, they were sometimes at a remove. His epic oil painting Storm Over Biafra, portraying the devastation and loss caused by the Nigerian civil war, was painted five years out from the conflict, because he was able to flee to the UK during it. Other modern Nigerian artists were less of the establishment, such as those of the Zaria   Society, who came together in 1958 to decolonise arts education in Nigeria. “Unlike Enwonwu who was a kind of national figure, these were figures who were questioning the politics of nationalism but also trying to create art that embodied the possibilities of independence.” Sign up to  Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world after newsletter promotion Taking in the expanse of the exhibition, from the pottery of Ladi Kwali and the wall reliefs of El-Anatsui to the adire (indigo dye) art of Nike Davies-Okundaye, I wonder about the challenges of acquisition. British university collections were generous, and there was good cooperation from Nigerian authorities. What proved more difficult was accessing private collections. Restoration was another issue, with about 50 works needing treatment, including Enwonwu’s Negritude, which was aided by conservators from the Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) in Benin City, Nigeria. I have to ask Bonsu what made him pursue Nigerian modernism specifically, considering that there are non-Nigerian artists in the show. (Bonsu himself is Ghanaian.) “I ask myself that question every day!” he says with a laugh. “In this period in particular, Nigeria was a melting pot for so many west African cultures. Lagos in the 19th century was a crossroads for formerly enslaved Afro-Brazilians who returned, Victorian Britons who were coming to create industry, and there were enterprising Nigerians creating economic networks across west Africa. So I think this is a west African story.” He expands, saying: “Many of these artists deal with the idea that Nigerian culture has to be taken as a multinational and multi-ethnic question, in which artists are free to disrupt and redirect different narratives in service of their own artistic vision. So when we talk about independence in this exhibition, it’s not just about political independence. It’s about the freedom of artists to choose what kind of narratives they want to absorb or reject.” Bonsu also wants us to think of Nigeria as an international hub for artists in the way that Paris, New York and London are: “People such as Ibrahim El-Salahi from Sudan, Naoko Matsubara, who’s Canadian-Japanese, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, who’s German, they were all coming to Nigeria to be part of this cultural renaissance.” Bonsu is hoping to tour the exhibition to other cities after it concludes its run at the Tate, focusing on locations where you can find the Nigerian diaspora. “If the show does anything, I hope it encourages local museums everywhere to really think, ‘What does it mean to preserve your national heritage?’” Bonsu also wants custodians of these works to figure out how they can offer access to the public domain. “Artists have always resisted exclusion,” he says, and so “the more ways to create access to these works, the better”.", "tags": ["nigeria", "the", "long", "wave", "africa", "sculpture", "art", "painting", "modernism", "newsletters"]},

She would rise early, sharpen her tools, walk several kilometres to the forest, cut down a tree, drag it back to her village in Kenya’s Kilifi county, chop it into smaller pieces, dig a pit, cover the wood with soil and branches, and set it alight. Then she would go home and prepare a simple meal of   (Kenya’s maize staple). She would keep returning to the pit until the wood had carbonised – a process that can take days – then pack the charcoal into sacks and wait for people on motorbikes to come and collect it. Then she would start all over again. Now five months pregnant, Pendo, 35, says she hasn’t burned charcoal for two months, after receiving a cash transfer of 110,000 shillings (£660). Instead, she grazes the livestock she bought with the money – six goats and two cows. “I feel much better. This will be my seventh child, and it is the first time I feel certain my baby will be properly nourished,” she says from the yard of her home in the village of Unaya Ndogo. A study published in August by the National Bureau of Economic Research which looked at the impact of unconditional cash transfers found that they   and under-five mortality by 45% in rural Kenya – effects rivalling those of vaccines or antimalarial drugs. The study looked at the period between 2014 and 2017 when the NGO GiveDirectly sent payments of up to $1,000 (£740) to 10,500 households in more than 650 villages in Kenya. “The problem with big aid organisations is that their approach is based on training and advice,” says Miriam Laker-Oketta, a Ugandan doctor and senior research adviser at GiveDirectly. “They tell people what to do and how to spend their money. But whether in Uganda, Yemen, India or the US, direct cash support has shown that when people living in poverty receive money, they know best what matters to them, and they invest in that.” On 8 August, Samini Kazungu, who also lives in Unaya Ndogo, lost her baby during childbirth. At 32, she already had four children, but an infection in her womb meant the fifth didn’t survive. “I went to the dispensary for weeks, but the treatment didn’t work,” she says. Kazungu lives in a small mud-brick house she built herself. During her pregnancy, she continued to tend her small maize and cowpea plot – a task she describes as “exhausting”. But her life changed on 16 August, when GiveDirectly transferred 55,000 shillings (£315) into her M-Pesa account, a mobile money system widely used in Kenya. In early September, she received a second transfer for the same amount. Kazungu says the money allowed her to pay the 5,000 shillings needed for postnatal treatment after the stillbirth – uterine cleaning and medication – something she says “wouldn’t have been possible without it”. With the rest, she bought clothes for her children, food, livestock, a motorcycle and a piece of land. The August study highlighted how financial support reshaped women’s daily lives, cutting back on the time they spent working and allowing them to focus on the wellbeing of their newborns: “The transfers resulted in a substantial decline of 51% in female labour supply in the three months before and the three months after a birth, and improved child nutrition,” the authors said. At Gandini dispensary, a small health centre near Pendo and Kazungu’s homes, nurse Joyce Ndame notes a decline in the main complications she used to see at the clinic. “Respiratory tract infections caused by charcoal burning have gone down because women have switched to other livelihoods,” she says. “What we’re seeing is that poverty was the barrier keeping these women from resting during pregnancy. As soon as they got the money, they did what was right for them. They are responsible for the nearly 50% reduction we’ve seen in infant and child mortality,” says Laker-Oketta, a mother of three whose experience as a doctor led her to work on the project. Edward Miguel, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-author of the study, says: “Initially, the programme was focused on understanding the broader economic impacts of cash transfers. But later we thought it would be interesting to study their effects on health.” The study found the transfers had improved diets and made health facilities more accessible for families, and also that the money had an impact on the wider community. Another study in 2022 found: “Local businesses in areas receiving more cash transfers also experienced meaningful revenue increases, in line with higher household spending.” For every dollar injected into the local economy, GDP rose by $2.50. “It was a very unusual finding,” says Miguel. In Lukole, a village where many have received the cash transfers, shopkeeper Elias Mweni, though not a recipient himself, says that his sales have doubled. “I now stock more beans, sugar, oil and cereals, and people have even started asking for rice and pasta, which they couldn’t afford before.” Benson Kazungu, says cash transfers helped him expand his clothing sales: “I used to have stock worth 5,000 shillings. Now it is 30,000 (£170).” The  , but it is gaining traction. In Kenya, the main national programme, Inua Jamii, provides 2,000 shillings (£11) a month to 1.7 million people living in poverty. In South Africa,   has also been hailed a success. Kate Orkin, from the Centre for the Study of African Economies at the University of Oxford, worked with the South African government to design a monthly grant for 10.5 million unemployed people during the pandemic, when lockdowns triggered mass layoffs and deepened poverty. “The programme rollout was a dramatic achievement – the infrastructure was built in less than a month and 10 million people were enrolled online in five weeks in 2020.” The project also led a new unemployment grant. “In one of the world’s most unequal countries, the grant is now keeping 3.8 million people each month above the food poverty line,” Orkin says.

One week after the intervention, the 13 babies are building up their strength on a diet of banana slices and leafy greens in  , which is home to one of the last remaining populations of the tortoise. As new members of one of the biggest and longest-lived reptile species in the world, the Aldabra giant tortoise, they could eventually reach a weight of about 250kg (39st) and live more than 100 years. The hatchlings are the survivors from 18 eggs taken from a single nest on Cousin Island by local conservationists after scientists used a groundbreaking technique to analyse whether the failed tortoise eggs were fertilised and capable of developing. The researchers said the successful trial could help to stave off an extinction crisis for other threatened species. “This is a huge leap,” said Alessia Lavigne, a Seychelloise based at the University of Sheffield, in England, who was the lead author of a   related to the project. “It shows what conservation can do.” The study examined the reproduction rates of five turtle and tortoise species, which revealed that 75% of undeveloped eggs had been fertilised but contained embryos that died at an early stage. Those findings cast new light on why the Aldabra giant tortoise, which is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for   of Nature, appears to have very low hatching success in wild nests. The failure rate is considered more likely to be due to environmental factors than to any genetic trait of the tortoises. Giant tortoises were wiped out from most other Indian Ocean islands in the 19th century as a result of hunting by sailors, but the population on the Aldabra group of islands in the Seychelles was saved thanks to their isolation. They, along with 400 other endemic species and the extraordinary colours of the landscape, were the reason why the atoll was listed as a world heritage site by Unesco in 1982. As a hedge against extinction, some individuals were moved to other islands, including Cousin, in the hope that they could establish backup populations in the event of new threats. This has proved prescient because at least one island is being developed as a luxury tourist resort, funded with Qatari money, as the Guardian   last year.

But the priority for research will be how to improve the conditions of wild nests. “It’s wonderful that these eggs have been shown to be viable but artificially incubating eggs is not a long-term solution,” said Nicola Hemmings of the University of Sheffield’s School of Biosciences. “We now need to identify the variables that are impacting survival in the natural nest environment, and then see if there are ways to improve them.” The team says it would like to share its results with scientists in the Galápagos islands, which are home to the only other species of giant tortoise.", "tags": ["conservation", "reptiles", "seychelles", "endangered", "species", "africa", "animals", "wildlife", "news"]},

The 25-year-old Ghanaian-Nigerian chef knew online dating in Accra, Ghana’s capital, was treacherous for transgender women. Despite this, she decided to create a profile in February 2019. Messages started flooding in. One man caught her attention and they decided to meet up. At the meeting place, he led her to a secluded building. Inside a room lit by a blue light, he locked the door. She sat, nervously waiting for him to make the first move. Suddenly, two people with torches appeared out of nowhere, filming her. “It felt like I was in a dream,” she says, recalling the realisation that something terrible was about to happen. For the next three hours, Delali was beaten, insulted and humiliated. Her attackers stole her money and phone, threatening to expose her identity to her contacts and the police. “I had to endure the torture, the pain, everything they did to me.” Delali is among hundreds of LGBTQ+ individuals in Ghana being targeted online by criminal gangs exploiting widespread homophobia and transphobia in the country. The targets, mainly gay men, bisexual men and trans women, are contacted on dating apps or other digital platforms by criminals pretending to be gay, and lured to isolated places where they are subjected to assault, robbery, blackmail and extortion. A common tactic involves recording and sharing nude videos and forced confessions to blackmail the victim and incite further attacks on queer people. Videos are also a way for perpetrators to gain traffic online, according to Ebenezer Peegah, director of the humanitarian advocacy group Rightify Ghana.  the Human Sexual Rights and Family Values bill in February last year, after it received bipartisan support. Even though same-sex relations were already illegal, the new legislation prescribed harsher punishments for LGBTQ+ activities, including a three-year jail term for same-sex intercourse and six-to-10 years’ imprisonment for producing, procuring or distributing materials deemed to promote homosexuality. Former president Nana Akufo-Addo declined to assent to the law, citing legal challenges, but human rights activists say the attempt to introduce the “anti-gay bill” led to a sharp  . There was also a   of disinformation during the period when the bill was being debated. A   by Rightify Ghana said politicians used openly homophobic messaging during the 2024 presidential election to sway voters, heightening the climate of intolerance that the anti-gay bill had already fomented. The bill was reintroduced in March this year.  Cases of attacks against LGBTQ+ people reported to Rightify Ghana rose to 300 in 2024, three times the number recorded the previous year, and continue to rise. In 2025, more than 120 cases have been reported to Rightify so far, while two other local organisations have received more than 200, according to Peegah, who says the groups do not want to be named. “These reported cases are just a fraction of what is happening because some victims don’t report their cases, and others don’t even know that there is help available,” he says. Despite the scale of the attacks, most cases go unreported due to fear and stigma.

The queer community is a carte blanche for people who want to rob their fellow humans. I mean, this is a way less dangerous way of making money for people who are already into criminal activity.” The most common platforms used for luring and further victimisation are Grindr, TikTok, Snapchat, Meta’s Facebook and WhatsApp groups, survivors say. The hate campaigns persist on these platforms, despite flouting their community standards. “It’s mostly Grindr,” says Kojo, a 31-year-old gay man who has survived at least two violent attacks through dating platforms. “Grindr is more anonymous. Nobody has their face on the platform.” The gangs, typically consisting of two to 15 people, work systematically, establishing online contact, abusing victims, filming and posting the content. Rightify’s director has noted a “disturbing trend” of these gangs sharing a “playbook” with specific keywords. A recent case involves a 14-year-old boy who was attacked and beaten by eight men for allegedly being gay. The video of the attack, in which he was forced to dance naked and sing “I am gay” in the local language, went viral on TikTok before being taken down. After TikTok removed the videoan audio version of the recording became a template sound for viral content on the platform. Between 24 April and the end of May 2025, 12,400 pieces of content were created on TikTok from the  . Using hashtags like #kofigay and #kofitrumutrumu [an offensive term used towards gay people], some users picked out old photos of the survivor and applied AI effects to make him dance to the audio. At the height of the trend on TikTok, the trolling evolved into the “ ”, which recorded more than 4,000 pieces of content from users mimicking how Kofi was abused. This proliferation of content appeared to encourage at least three similar attacks, according to Peegah. “Dozens of cases have been documented after his accident,” he says. “As we saw that in about three cases, the victims were told to sing and dance like in Kofi’s video.” TikTok says it removed the Kofi hashtags after being alerted to them by the Guardian, and says it “does not allow hate speech, hateful behaviour, or promotion of hateful ideologies”; or “the sharing (or threatening to share) details about a person’s private sexual life”.

Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, the DRC foreign minister, urged the EU to levy much stronger sanctions against  , which has fuelled the conflict in eastern DRC, describing the bloc’s response to violations of DRC territory as “very timid”. Referencing the EU’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she said: “It is an obvious double standard – I want to be constructive here – that makes us curious and inquisitive about understanding why the EU again struggles so much to take action.” The DRC and Rwanda  , brokered by the US and Qatar, aiming to end the decades-old conflict, which escalated early this year when  , including two key cities. But deadly attacks on civilians have continued and a deadline to reach a peace agreement was missed in August. Last year a group of UN experts said up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside M23 and that the Rwandan military was in “de facto control of M23 operations”. Rwanda has long denied backing M23 and says its forces act in self-defence. The DRC president, Félix Tshisekedi, on Thursday appealed to his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, to stop supporting militants in the DRC at a Brussels event attended by both leaders, drawing a rebuke from Kigali that he was “completely mistaken” about the roots of the conflict. Saying he was stretching out his hand to make peace, Tshisekedi told Kagame: “This requires you to order the M23 troops supported by your country to stop this escalation, which has already caused enough deaths.” The Rwandan foreign minister, Olivier Nduhungirehe, later responded on X, saying Tshisekedi was “completely mistaken” and accusing him of abusing the platform at the Brussels event. Speaking before the meeting, Wagner drew parallels between Rwanda’s violation of DRC territory and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The EU had adopted a catalogue of sanctions against Russia, but made only “very timid progress” over the conflict in eastern DRC. The eastern DRC, a region bordering Rwanda with abundant natural resources but plagued by non-state armed groups, has suffered extreme violence for more than three decades. The EU has placed sanctions on 32 people and two entities – a militant group and a Rwandan gold refiner dealing in illegal supplies of the metal – for their role in fuelling the conflict. Setting out justifications for these sanctions, the EU said the Rwandan Defence Force in eastern DRC had violated the DRC’s territory and “sustains the armed conflict … [and is] also responsible for serious human rights abuses, including collective punishment”. Despite this finding of human rights abuses by the Rwandan army in the DRC, the European Commission has , which is intended to boost the supply of raw materials to power Europe’s electric car batteries and microchips. Wagner said the memorandum of understanding with Rwanda was “void of any credibility in a context where it has been established that Rwanda has been siphoning off Congolese resources” extracted under brutal conditions of forced labour, involving children. The US and many others have raised concerns about illegal trade in gold and tantalum in eastern Congo, extracted via forced labour, then trafficked to Rwanda for export to benefit armed groups. Sign up to  Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world after newsletter promotion Wagner said it was up to the EU whether it chose to suspend or annul the agreement “but silence is probably the least constructive [response] and the most perplexing one”. The conflict in eastern DRC is one of the seven wars Donald Trump claims to have ended, although between June and the end of September the UN reported 1,087 people had been killed. It remains one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with more than 7.8 million people internally displaced in eastern DRC and 28 million facing food insecurity, including 4 million at emergency levels, according to the UN. As the DRC’s chief diplomat, Wagner signed the agreement with Rwanda in the White House in June, which also aims to give the US greater access to Congolese natural resources. She said the US was still engaged in the peace process and she rejected suggestions that Trump’s sole motivation was the DRC’s vast mineral wealth, while adding: “It is just a reality ... that this potential is currently untapped.” She was in Brussels to take part in a conference on  , Europe’s lower-budget answer to the Chinese  , which aims to finance infrastructure projects around the world. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, opened the conference on Thursday, saying the EU wanted “partnerships based on common interests and respect for sovereignty”. She highlighted the Lobito corridor – rail, road and water transport links – connecting the mineral heartlands of the DRC and Zambia to Angola’s Atlantic coast. Wagner said the EU and DRC had a strong foundation in the Lobito project, but “a lot has been overshadowed by the situation in eastern DRC”.", "tags": ["democratic", "republic", "of", "the", "congo", "european", "union", "rwanda", "africa", "europe", "news"]},

Alaa Abd el-Fattah said he feared his mother might have died on hunger strike during the 12 years he spent in what he described as a “vortex of incarceration”. In an interview from Cairo, Abd el-Fattah also said he needed a pause in his human rights campaigning to give himself time to heal, adding he no longer believed prison was a necessary rite of passage on the route to freedom. Smiling and joking in a Steve Biko T-shirt, he said he felt surprisingly well but needed time to find himself after so long either in solitary confinement or isolated in jail. About the British government’s efforts to secure his release, he said simply: “We did manage to get me out but we did not manage to get a consular visit. That still does not make sense to me. But that might be on the previous government. This one might have inherited the situation.” He also thanked those in the UK who had campaigned for his release and given strength to his own family, lightly referencing Margaret Thatcher’s claim that society did not exist in the UK. “It does exist and my family has experienced it,” he said. Abd el-Fattah rose to prominence as one of the most compelling voices of the Arab spring in 2011, but   since 2014, the year after President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi came to power in a military coup. In 2014,   for participating in a demonstration about the outlawing of protest. In September 2019, only six months after he had been released on nightly probation, he was arrested again and held in pre-trial detention for more than two years. He was convicted in December 2021 of “spreading false news” for sharing a post about a prisoner dying of torture, and handed another five-year sentence. His 69-year-old mother, Laila, based in London and Cairo, went on   lasting 287 days and was twice  . He said: “There were long periods of despair when I did not think I was going to be released. Then there were long periods of despair when I was not sure whether I was going to survive and I was not sure whether my mother was going to survive, and I was not sure I would want to survive if my mother did not survive.” He said the relationship with his Brighton-based 14-year-old autistic son Khaled is his most important preoccupation. He said: “He is with me now. He has taken a few weeks off from school. We are hanging out together, we go swimming, we go rowing, we are sleeping in the same room so there is some serious bonding, trying to catch up, build a new connection. His mother has been amazing. I do not know how she did that, but he was ready for me. There was no estrangement.” For most of the time in jail, Abd el-Fattah did not see his son since the visits were short and behind glass, and it was not suitable for someone on the autism spectrum. “In the six years I have been in prison I have seen him a handful of times,” he said. “We hit it off immediately and I am looking forward to seeing him in Brighton, and understanding his world there because it is completely new to me. “I was aware of the campaign and my mother’s conditions, albeit with time delays. I am candid in prison visits. My family is candid. We talked freely even though they are always listening in. It is better than having secrets.” He said he thought his mother might die, “not because either government wanted that outcome, but their sense of time has nothing to do with how time operates for people caught up in this vortex of incarceration. They were moving at a speed that had nothing to do with what was going on with me or my mother. “I was seriously worried about her. I was also worried about her sustaining some form of permanent damage that compromised her health for the future.” Asked what freedom felt like, he said: “It is overwhelming. It is also comfortable and natural, and I am immediately fitting in with them, including witnessing three family fights in two days. The usual stuff. It is wonderful to be back, and going to visit other family houses. It is wonderful to be back in that. That is what I have missed the most. This connection with family, with children, catching up on who has had how many children. And my mum, I think, is happy to open my door and see that I am sleeping there, and am just there. I don’t have to do anything.” Discussing his plans for the future and whether he will risk political activism in   again, he says: “I deserve to heal. I deserve to take time to heal.

It is definitely going to involve writing, but there is no opportunity for organising in Egypt and it is too dangerous at the moment. It is also the world right now – with what is happening in Palestine, and we seem to have gone down a dead end with climate change. “It is difficult to imagine what a single voice can do. It is time for deep reflection and new modalities of engaging with things, and to try to find new modalities for freedom. I was stuck for too long in prison so I didn’t really get a chance to think about it… but in my last free moments I was stuck in an inherited position in which one could easily believe the road to freedom was through prison – and I don’t think that works. “What is activism without putting yourself in harm’s way? Maybe I’m middle-aged and maybe I need to admit to it, and be a dad and a dad activist. I don’t know. I need to think differently, to think less locally because I am going to be in the UK, and the deadlock in the world right now is not resolvable from a place like Egypt – though I think there is benefit in having a perspective from a place like Egypt because there is a deadlock of imagination in the global north, and a deadlock in the possibility of action in the global south.” He stressed: “But I don’t have any notions that I am going to be a major intellectual, it’s just a question of how do I engage with the world and what’s my place in it? I am not imagining the world is waiting for me to change things. It’s possible that what I have to say is how to live with defeat, or how to live with despair, or how to champion a lost cause. I do not think there is such a thing as a victory even for the rich. They are stuck in an imaginary where we are going to cease to exist. But we are not going to cease to exist. “I think we have got to stop thinking about victories and start thinking about how the hell we are going to live with each other, how are we going to live with the world we have inherited and the world we have constructed and keep constructing. The only way to make the world a kinder place is to champion these lost causes.” He recounts how the confusion surrounding the tumultuous day of his release from jail led to him being locked out of his home. “We were being told it was a matter of days that I would be released in late July and after three weeks it became very frustrating and humiliating so I was not sure what was going on. In this world there are black boxes and elephants all the way down, not knowing what is going on. “I was cooking and apparently on the ticker on the TV screen there was an item that I had been given a presidential pardon. We did not see it until we sat down to eat. We froze the frame and called the prison guard. I was saying: ‘Call the warden, it says I am being released. I want to have a shower,’ and then they were ready and then it was process, process, waiting for my paperwork.” Cairo’s   has many exit points and he did not know his family were already waiting outside. “I thought there was some arrangement so there was no media circus and my family would be waiting at home. The [officers] drove me to my local police station,” he said. The prison guards did not want him leaving in prison clothes so agreed to buy him some civilian clothes. “So they bought me a nice white shirt. It’s Cairo, so you can buy things at midnight. “One of the officers drove me from the station and dropped me off at the house. He asked: ‘Do you want to check if there is anyone upstairs?’ and I said: ‘No, it’s OK, I am home.’ He left. I went upstairs, and there was no one, so I hung out and talked with the shopkeepers and neighbours until I found someone with a phone to ring my family to say I was home. They were two hours away outside the prison gates. So I spent two hours talking to the pharmacist and neighbours. The Cairo street scene and the kindness of people felt like freedom. I was wearing civilian clothes among civilians. I did not have money, I did not have a phone, but I was home.” He admits he cannot know what secured his release after so many reverses. “Ultimately what mattered to us was that there was a broad community in the public and it was very British and very supportive and that also inspired Egyptians to feel more bold in expressing their solidarity. Activists, artists, people in the media and MPs. It was broad and communal. I did not know it all because I was isolated but I could see its impact on my family and on the way I was treated in prison. It still took putting my own body on the line and my mother putting her own body on the line, all the way to the limit. It took a lot of brilliant organising. “We could not have done it without that support, and given the UK is still a democracy I would rather there wasn’t this very binary mentality of the state and society being two separate things – this is too partisan, talking about society, since Margaret Thatcher said society does not exist - but it does. If there was ever a question about whether British society exists, my family has experienced it in this campaign.

It said in a later statement that the shelter had been hit twice by drones and eight times by artillery shells on Friday and Saturday. “Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,” said the committee, which is part of a group of activists who coordinate aid and document abuses in the conflict. “The situation has gone beyond disaster and genocide inside the city, and the world remains silent.” A separate medical group, called the Sudan Doctors’ Network, gave a figure of 53 people killed in the strikes, including 14 children and 15 women.

Practical, tough, down-to-earth and brave, she had great resilience, and her cool nerve marked her out for the demanding work she carried out, often in areas of armed conflict. In every setting her courage, simple kindness, professionalism and cultural sensitivity earned her respect and acceptance. Maureen was born in Rusape in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), to May (nee Sime), a housewife, and Robert Lynch, a train driver. Her parents had left   in the early 1950s and raised her to consider the UK as her true home. After finishing her secondary education in Bulawayo, she went to Edinburgh to train as a nurse, at the Royal Infirmary. Rather than settling in Edinburgh after qualifying, she returned to what was then war-torn   in 1979. There she worked as a nurse for the Save the Children Fund UK, running mobile clinics in remote, often insecure areas. Having witnessed the lack of care available to women in rural Africa, she returned to the UK in 1982 to train as a midwife at the Singleton hospital in Swansea. As soon as she qualified in 1984, Maureen moved to  , where she provided training to traditional midwives on behalf of Save the Children while living in an adobe hut, with no electricity or running water. I was the charity’s country director there, and she and I met soon after she arrived: we married in 1986. After three years in Burkina Faso, Maureen moved with Save the Children to Sindh province in  , where she was a health and nutrition programme manager. She then became a community nurse (1989-91) in the Northwest Territories of Canada and Peru (1991-94), before switching to a more managerial role as a health programme manager in Cuba (1995-96) for Save the Children and then in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for Concern Worldwide. Returning to the UK in 1998, she managed the logistics of the move of Save the Children’s head office from Camberwell to Vauxhall in London. But within a year she was out in the field again as a community nurse/midwife with Health  , serving Inuit settlements in the Northwest Territories and Kwanlin Dün communities in the Yukon, where we lived for the next 20 years.

Tick Belrose (played by Hugo Weaving) is on stage lip syncing as his Mitzi Del Bra; clad in a silver sequin dress with matching gloves and a bouffant blonde wig. This is the opening scene from “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert”, which first screened at Cannes Film Festival 30 years ago this month. “I made that dress for myself,” Tim Chappel, one of the movie’s costume designers, told CNN. “The weekend before, I’d gone to the Miss Teen USA beauty pageant as Miss Silicon Valley, because (the dress) had joke plastic boobs inside. Stephan (Elliott, the film’s writer and director) was really on my case because I wanted to do lots of obscure stuff (to costume the film ), and he wanted (the principal characters in drag)  to look like ladies. So I said we can make him look like a lady and take the piss at the same time, because the boobs are clearly from a party shop. And I’d already made it, so it was cheap!” In the film, Tick scoops up his freshly widowed friend Bernadette Bassenger (played by Terence Stamp) and flamboyant, fellow drag queen Adam Whitley/ Felicia Jollygoodfellow (actor Guy Pearce) and goes west — both musically and literally — for a road trip across the Outback in their affectionately-christened bus: Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. “We were just having a laugh!” Chappel said, recalling the film’s production. Sydney 30 years ago was at a unique point in time and culture; not yet tethered to the rest of the world via the internet, the somewhat isolated drag scene was able to cultivate its own sprawling visual language for storytelling and sexual politics, beyond the more recognizable female impersonation that Elliott might have initially pushed for. “It was my first opportunity to really express myself as a designer, and I wasn’t going to let anybody stand in my way,” Chappel said. “I just really wanted to make (the film’s wardrobe) unique and interesting.” Film critic Susan Barber, despite calling out the problematic handling of female and non-white characters, dubbed “Priscilla” the “darling” of the Cannes Film Festival after it premiered there in 1994. The film quickly drew attention for its costuming in particular, winning Chappel and fellow designer an Oscar in 1995. Among many iconic looks is the flip-flop (or ‘thong,’ if you’re Australian) dress. It was made from shoes Chappel bought for $15 in Target using his mother’s staff discount — “which was good,” he said, “because that was about three quarters of our budget.” Their mandated thriftiness meant that several costumes, “made with hot glue, chicken wire and duct tape”, fell apart not long after the cameras stopped rolling. The flip-flop dress survived, though — that was made with cable ties, as well as duct tape. Two years passed between Chappel first joining the project and its (limited) funding being secured. The time allowed him to play with and re-do ideas, evolving initial plans into their extravagant final form. In one scene, for instance, Tick, Adam and Bernadette put on a fireside performance of Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” for a group of First Nations people. Rather than mimic Gaynor’s hairstyle directly, however, Chappel spent his elongated preparation time adding an increasing bouquet of flowers to the trio’s headpieces, until eventually there was no hair left at all. “I think that’s definitely one of the most iconic looks,” drag artist and costumer Philmah Bocks told CNN. Bocks has been designing costumes for 30 years, having broken into the drag scene around the same time “Priscilla” was hitting screens. “The thong dress is a very iconic piece too, because I think that’s very (stereotypically) Australian. And of course the big finale look, with the emus on top of their heads. That’s the beauty of ‘Priscilla’: they’ve really captured a moment in Australian time and used Australian culture and flora and fauna to create these wonderful pieces.” “The art of drag costuming is the ability to turn drab into fab,” she continued. “’Priscilla’ showed us a lot of that, because a lot of that type of design work was happening in and around Sydney in the early ‘90s. There was this sort of explosion of drag costuming that went beyond couture. Of course, queens were also on a budget. You couldn’t always afford hundreds or even thousands of dollars to create the most beautiful pieces, but you could kind of get there with stuff we found in a dumpster! It’s what you do with it that makes the difference… I’ve been replicating (Chappel’s) costumes for 30 years, so I’ve got a lot to thank him for!” Bocks is known for her foam, or ‘Phoam’, wigs, a look also popularized in “Priscilla” which she’s made for London’s hit musical “Priscilla the Party!” as well as for Katy Perry on an episode of “American Idol”. These creations also follow the “drab to fab” ethos: they’re made from materials bought at the hardware store. “I remember buying this product from the hardware store knowing full well that it was going on Katy Perry’s head, and that made me laugh a little,” Bocks said. “Of course, by the time I’d finished with it, it looked nothing like it had originally.” Perhaps more so than any other costume, the enduring image from “Priscilla” is Adam/ Felicia’s opera performance atop the moving bus, decked out in hundreds of meters of flowing silver lamé. Its inspiration came from the Rolls Royce “Spirit of Ecstasy” bonnet ornament, though once again the final product went far beyond the script’s guidance. Felicia’s windswept aria comes after their bus is scrawled in homophobic graffiti — a reflection of the community’s resilience against hate and disaster in real life. “Priscilla” received her standing ovation at Cannes seven months before Australia decriminalized homosexuality at federal level; three years before Tasmania would become the final state to pass similar legislation, and at a time when the AIDS crisis was still at large. Despite that, Chappel remembers the film as coming at a positive turning point: were being trialed, replacing toxic doses of the AZT drug that had previously been offered. “All of a sudden there was hope. Out of the blue,” he said. ““Priscilla”, I think, captures that energy of everybody coming back to life.” Stephan Elliott has recently announced that a sequel to “Priscilla” is in the works, with Chappel on board. The newest addition to the empire will join “Priscilla’s” musical adaptation, which has toured the globe in Chappel’s costumes since 2006. The film’s legacy can also be seen in Australia’s drag scene today and, since 2021, has been broadcast to new audiences via contestants on “Rupaul’s Drag Race Down Under”. “If I get run over by a bus tomorrow,” Chappel said, “the last little thought that goes through my head – besides ‘ouch’ – is going to be ‘I’ve left an impression, that’s cool’.”", "tags": ["adventures", "iconic", "queen", "desert", "priscilla", "years"]},
{"content": "Australian police are seeking two people for allegedly vandalizing a century-old Chinese parade dragon and other valuable artefacts at a museum in a small town known for its historic links to China. The vandalism took place last week at the Golden Dragon Museum in Bendigo, about 100 miles northwest of Melbourne, according to the police and head of the museum. Victoria Police said a man and a woman are suspected of damaging AUD$100,000 ($66,900) worth of art and historical items, before making off in a silver Toyota Prado on May 5. “Investigators believe the duo used a liquid to cause damage to multiple statues and paintings,” police said, adding that the suspects were with two children at the time. Among the artefacts attacked was Loong – described by the museum as the “oldest complete imperial processional dragon in the world.” “ ” is a sacred mythical creature in Chinese culture – usually translated as dragon in English – and is often the protagonist in festivities and rituals. have been documented at ceremonial events since the Han Dynasty (202 BCE to 220 CE) and often involve teams of dancers manipulating a giant dragon puppet through the streets. Bendigo, currently a city of some 100,000 people, has had Chinese residents for more than a century. Chinese immigrants first arrived mostly from southern China in the mid-1800s during the Victorian goldrush and at one point made up 20 percent of the town’s residents. Miners and merchants brought their customs and culture with them to a place they once called “Dai Gum San” - or “Big Gold Mountain,” according to Bendigo Tourism. To this day, a large dragon parade is held every Easter to raise money for a local hospital. The Golden Dragon Museum was opened in 1991 “to document, interpret and preserve the Chinese heritage in Australia” according to the museum’s website. Loong, which dates back 1901, was routinely paraded through the streets of Victoria until the 1970s when it was retired. Hugo Leschen, Chief Executive Officer of the museum, told CNN that they found oily liquid running down Loong’s nose. Its successor Sun Loong, which took over to parade around the Bendigo until it was also retired in 2019, was also damaged, Leschen said, citing stains on the second dragon’s tongue. Other parts of the museum were also targeted. Security camera footage aired on CNN affiliate Nine News showed a woman clad in a white sweater and grey beanie splashing liquid at a Buddhist altar. A man stood next to her in the clip. Stains were also found on at least 35 paintings and several statues of Chinese deities in the temple as well as a garden next door managed by the museum, Leschen said. “With these further attacks it is now evident that this was no random act of mindless vandalism but rather a planned and sustained malicious attack across various heritage, cultural and religious sites for reasons unknown,” he said. The Chinese Community Council of Australia condemned the vandalism in a statement. While police have yet to comment on the motivation, the group is concerned the act “may have been racially motivated.”", "tags": ["dragon", "museum", "australian", "parade", "world", "chinese", "vandals", "oldest"]},

Trinity College Cambridge permanently repatriated the spears to the La Perouse Aboriginal Community at a ceremony Tuesday, according to a joint statement from the college and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), which supported the move. The four spears are the last remaining examples from a collection of 40 which Cook’s records show his expedition took from the Gweagal people living at Kamay on April 29, 1770. “The spears were pretty much the first point of European contact, particularly British contact with Aboriginal Australia,” said Ray Ingrey, director of the Gujaga Foundation, a research organization working in the La Perouse community, in the statement. “I think for us it’s a momentous occasion that where Australia’s history began, in 1770 on the shores of Botany Bay at Kurnell, the spears that were undoubtedly taken without permission are returned to the rightful people.” Cook marking the first known European contact with eastern Australia. The resulting British colonization of Australia resulted in the introduction of foreign diseases, displacement, and massacres against the aboriginal people. The spears were given to Trinity College in 1771 and have been held in the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA) in Cambridge since the early 20th century. Some members of the La Perouse Aboriginal Community are direct descendants of those who crafted the spears, according to the statement. “They are an important connection to our past, our traditions, and cultural practices, and to our ancestors,” said Noeleen Timbery, chair of the La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council, in the statement. “Our Elders have worked for many years to see their ownership transferred to the traditional owners of Botany Bay.” The college agreed to return the spears in March 2023 after loaning them to museums in Australia in 2015 and 2020. “This is an important day at Trinity for all parties involved in what has been a rewarding and respectful process, and ultimately a remarkable journey,” said Sally Davies, master of Trinity, in the statement. “This is the right decision and Trinity is committed to reviewing the complex legacies of the British empire, not least in our collections.” The spears will be displayed at a new visitor center which is going to be constructed at Kurnel, Kamay.

Rinehart has reportedly called for the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) to remove her portrait, one of 21 individual works that make up a single piece in Namatjira’s exhibition from display.

Australian media has reported that Rinehart approached the NGA’s director and chair to request the painting’s removal. The NGA said in a statement to CNN Thursday that it “welcomes the public having a dialogue on our collection and displays.” “Since 1973, when the National Gallery acquired Jackson Pollocks’ Blue Poles, there has been a dynamic discussion on the artistic merits of works in the national collection, and/or on display at the Gallery,” the NGA statement continued. “We present works of art to the Australian public to inspire people to explore, experience and learn about art.” Namatjira said in a statement that he paints “people who are wealthy, powerful, or significant – people who have had an influence on this country, and on me personally, whether directly or indirectly, whether for good or for bad.” “I paint the world as I see it,” he said. “People don’t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, ‘why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?’” “Some people might not like it, other people might find it funny but I hope people look beneath the surface and see the serious side too,” Namatjira added. Rinehart is the executive chairman of Hancock Prospecting, a privately owned mining company that was founded by her father, Lang Hancock.

{"content": "To visitors, is a glorious tapestry of historic buildings, waterways, bell towers, red roofs — and a mighty winged lion, the symbol of the Venetian republic, carved into structures across the city. Possibly the most famous version of the lion is a bronze statue standing atop a column in the Piazzetta adjoining — and now, researchers think the statue was made in China. After studying samples from the metal lion using lead isotope analysis, researchers from northern Italy’s University of Padua found that the copper used to create the bronze alloy (which is a mix of copper and tin) on the original bronze work came from the Yangtze river in China, according to a study published in the journal on Thursday. This, they said, would explain why the 4-meter- (13-foot-) long and 2.2-meter- (7-foot-) high statue, previously thought to have been made locally, in Syria or Anatolia, is stylistically mysterious. Although it was installed in St. Mark’s Square in the 13th century, the lion more closely resembles work produced in China during the Tang Dynasty — 618 to 907 AD — than that found in medieval Mediterranean Europe, the researchers argue, citing the shape of its snout and scars from the removal of earlier horns. The column on which the lion stands is from Anatolia (part of modern-day Turkey), and the lion itself has been repaired several times, with the earliest recorded instance in 1293. “It is possible that Marco Polo’s father and uncle, during the four years they spent at the court of Kublai Khan during their first journey, were responsible for the acquisition of the sculpture,” the researchers said, adding that the visit likely took place between 1264 and 1268. The animal was originally a a monumental, fierce, lion-like tomb guardian from the Tang Dynasty, the authors speculate. Once the Polos sent the statue back to Italy after their visit to the Mongol court, it was probably “discreetly and laboriously refitted” to look like the holy emblem of St. Mark, with horns removed and a “wig” added, they added. “In a puzzling absence of written information, the intention and logistics behind its journey to Venice remain elusive and open to interpretation. If the installation of the ‘Lion’ was meant to send a strong, defensive political message, we can now also read it as a symbol of the impressive connectedness of the medieval world,” they added.", "tags": ["lion", "famous", "venice", "chinese", "scientists"]},

A museum in Australia has moved Picasso artworks to a women’s restroom, skirting a discrimination complaint by a male visitor who couldn’t enter an exhibit where the works were previously hung. Two paintings and a drawing by Pablo Picasso  were originally featured in American artist and museum curator  Kirsha Kaechele’s “ ” installation at Tasmania’s Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) –  which opened in December 2020 – “to any and all ladies.” The experiential artwork was billed by the museum as a “tremendously lavish space” where women can indulge in “decadent nibbles, fancy tipples, and other ladylike pleasures” served by a male butler while they peruse art in a green velvet-draped room. But MONA was ordered to stop refusing entry to “persons who do not identify as ladies” after the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled in April that the show violated Australia’s 1998 Anti-Discrimination Act. Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room was indeed part of the art — giving them a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history. The Picasso pieces are now displayed in an upgraded restroom with a fully functional toilet dubbed “Ladies Room,” located within the art venue, Kaechele said in an e-mail. “While the Ladies Lounge undergoes a series of reforms to meet the exemptions required for reopening, I’ve been doing a little redecorating. I thought a few of the bathrooms in the museum could do with an update,” she added. “Some Cubism in the cubicles.” On Monday, Kaechele posted on a video and images of the relocated works in situ, and pointed out that the gendered restroom was also a first for the museum. She encouraged “all ladies” to enjoy the new exhibition. “We never had female toilets at Mona before, they were all unisex. But then the Ladies Lounge had to close thanks to a lawsuit brought on by a man. And I just didn’t know what to do with all those Picassos…,” wrote Kaechele, who is also the wife of MONA’s owner, David Walsh. Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales was barred from entering the “Ladies Lounge” exhibit on April 1 in 2023.

After the judgment, Kaechele she would challenge the court’s decision in the state’s Supreme Court and offered several possibilities to revive the “Ladies Lounge” concept. Among those ideas included finding loopholes under Section 27 of the Anti-Discrimination Act which lists exceptions on when discrimination against gender would be permitted.

Julie Inman Grant had sought a Federal Court ruling after X failed to fully comply with a takedown order issued under the country’s Online Safety Act following the incident in April. Instead, Inman Grant said Wednesday she would “consolidate action” concerning the removal notice in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), an independent review process that examines decisions taken by the commissioner. “After weighing multiple considerations, including litigation across multiple cases, I have considered this option likely to achieve the most positive outcome for the online safety of all Australians, especially children,” she said in a statement. The eSafety commissioner had wanted X to hide the video for users beyond Australian borders. Musk criticized the request as an excessive overreach by an unelected official that could set a precedent for other countries to demand the removal of sensitive material. “Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian ‘eSafety Commissar’ is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet?” in April. In a statement, X welcomed the latest development as a victory for free speech. “This case has raised important questions on how legal powers can be used to threaten global censorship of speech, and we are heartened to see that freedom of speech has prevailed,” it said. Joanne Gray, a lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, said the decision to drop the case was “rational” for a public institution with limited resources. But she added that the question of Australia’s jurisdiction over online content remains unanswered. “[Musk] might claim it’s a victory for free speech but I don’t think that is really what it is. It’s more of a corporate win, and says more about the ability of platform companies to operate outside of the reach of governments,” Gray said. She said the end of the legal action demonstrates the need for a global approach to online regulation, adding that “it’s hard for Australia to fix these issues when it’s acting alone.” The controversial video showed the moment , allegedly by a 16-year-old assailant, while delivering a sermon at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church in western Sydney. The incident set off a riot outside the church that authorities said was stoked by the rapid distribution of the video online. However, in court filings, lawyers for X argued that it had taken down some URLs seen by an Australian audience, but the video was readily available to view on other sites. “The Video is, and at all material times has been, widely accessible to persons in Australia other than on the X platform, including in its full form on other social media services and various websites,” court documents said. Musk’s lawyers also said the commissioner had failed to consider that the video was shared with the bishop’s consent, not by his assailant. The Assyrian Orthodox cleric was quoted in court filings as supporting the distribution of the video as an exercise in free speech. “Noting our God given right to freedom of speech and freedom of religion, I am not opposed to [the video] remaining on social media,” the bishop said, according to court documents. In her statement Wednesday, Inman Grant defended her decision to pursue the matter, which she said had given the agency an opportunity to test its “novel regulatory powers … to protect Australians from online harm.” “Our sole goal and focus in issuing our removal notice was to prevent this extremely violent footage from going viral, potentially inciting further violence and inflicting more harm on the Australian community. I stand by my investigators and the decisions eSafety made,” the statement said. Inman Grant told Australia’s national broadcaster, the ABC, that she’d been subject to personal attacks, including death threats, from Musk’s supporters. “Targeting a regulator who is here to protect the citizens of Australia is really beyond the pale, but it’s not surprising,” she reportedly told the ABC.

Dozens of countries have banned disposable vapes, but with the ban on vape sales in shops, service stations and other small retailers, Australia has introduced “world leading” laws, according to the government.

Adults will be able to buy vapes in pharmacies, without a prescription – but the devices may be hard to find after some leading pharmacy chains declared they would refuse to stock them. “Pharmacists are healthcare professionals and community pharmacies do not want to supply this potentially harmful, highly addictive product without a prescription,” said Anthony Tassone, the , which represents over 5,900 community pharmacies nationwide. Australia’s Greens Party had pushed for the amendments to allow adults to buy vapes without a prescription because they do not support prohibition or the criminalization of vaping. “The prohibition of drugs has failed. The Greens are pleased that we have secured amendments to this legislation that will ensure that no person will be criminalised for personal possession of a vaping product,” Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John said in a statement. It’s not a criminal offense to possess vapes for personal use, but the import and sale of commercial quantities of vapes will attract large fines. Some fear the new laws will create a black market for vapes, much like one that exists for cigarettes in Australia, which imposes some of the highest tobacco taxes in the world. A box of 20 cigarettes costs around 35 Australian dollars ($23) – considerably more than in the United States and the United Kingdom.

But there is a caveat: both legs include a two-hour stop in Auckland, New Zealand, during which passengers can step off the aircraft for a break, so while it’s “direct,” it’s not nonstop. Various carriers have tried to claim “longest” titles as their part of their marketing campaigns – but most experts agree the top prize belongs to Singapore Airlines.

China Eastern Airlines said its flight is going to be “the world’s first commercial route connecting antipodal cities” – cities located at opposite sides of the earth. The airline opts for an unusual southerly flight path, across some of the world’s most remote waters and close to Antarctica, a choice that China Eastern says will help shave at least four hours off the total journey. The route, flown on a wide-body Boeing 777-300ER, will operate twice weekly, starting from December 4, according to the state-owned airline. “The Shanghai Pudong-Auckland-Buenos Aires route is seen as an important measure to build a new ‘Air Silk Road’ channel between Asia-Pacific and South America,” the airline added. According to booking site Skyscanner, the quickest flight from Shanghai to Buenos Aires, offered by Air France and Lufthansa, takes nearly 31 hours, with a layover either in Paris or Amsterdam. But the gap closes for the return trip, with other carriers providing flight options with durations ranging from a little more than 28 hours to 33 hours.

{"content": "A towering 5,000 feet high, with more than 7,000 steps, Mount Tai, in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong, is known for turning legs to jelly for anyone game for scaling to the top. Videos all over Chinese social media, such as TikTok’s sister app Douyin, show even the fittest hikers shaking, collapsing or trying to climb downhill on all fours. Some visitors hire “ ” to help them make the summit. But tourism officials in Shandong have come up with another idea: robotic legs. On January 29, the first day of Chinese New Year, ten AI-powered exoskeletons debuted at Mount Tai (Taishan in Mandarin), attracting over 200 users for a fee of 60 yuan to 80 yuan ($8 - $11 USD) per use during a week-long trial, according to . Co-developed by Taishan Cultural Tourism Group and Kenqing Technology, a Shenzhen-based tech company, this device is designed to wrap around users’ waists and thighs and weighs in at just 1.8 kilograms, according to the firm’s product . Powered by AI algorithms, it can sense users’ movements and provide “synchronized assistance” to ease the burden of legs, according to Kenqing Technology. Each robotic exoskeleton runs on two batteries, lasting for about five hours, according to Wang Houzhe, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Taishan Cultural Tourism Group. It generally takes six hours to climb to the top. “It really works!” Li Chengde, a 68-year-old tourist from the capital Jinan, told state-run Xinhua News Agency after trying out the device. “It felt like someone was pulling me uphill!” “This can help more people hike up the mountain and enjoy the scenery of Mount Tai… without it being too strenuous,” Wang told Chinese state media. Jacky, a content creator from Shandong who requested a pseudonym for privacy reasons, tested the device last Sunday for half an hour over hundreds of steps. While echoing the general positive feedback as many others, he told CNN there is still room for improvement. “The experience is definitely easier,” he said about climbing with the device on. “But once I took it off, I felt a bit clumsy walking (on my own).” The 29-year-old said he felt like a “puppet” with the machine doing all the work but once he got used to not exerting himself, it was “really tiring” after he removed the exoskeleton and went back to climbing of his own power. Jacky added he also found the device inconvenient when he needed to use the bathroom and tie his shoelaces while wearing it. The exoskeleton requires extra hands to put on and take off and fully squatting down could risk breaking the tight straps. He also said that the battery needed more juice. Wang from the Taishan Cultural Tourism Group said the team will extend battery life and set up replacement spots along the hiking trails, according to . Currently in beta testing, the exoskeletons are expected to hit the mass market in early March, according to the local publicity department. Despite a few hiccups, Jacky deems the exoskeleton robots a “good product” and a “true blessing” for the elderly, children and mobility-impaired visitors. Half of the hikers who opted to try out the prototype exoskeletons at Mount Tai were senior citizens. In addition to making mountain climbing a whole lot easier, these walking supports have sparked online discussions about their wider applications in a country grappling with a . Last year, 22% of China’s population was over 60, and that figure is expected to rise to 30% by 2035, with the elderly population surpassing 400 million, according to the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics. And the market size of smart elderly care in China was estimated at 6.8 trillion yuan (about $934 billion) in 2024, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported. Kenqing Technology, the robotic exoskeletons’ co-developer, which was founded in 2015, is eyeing this vast elderly care market. It has rolled out an exoskeleton specifically designed for elderly users, weighing 2.4 kilograms and priced at 17,000 yuan ($2,334 USD) on . To fully unlock the potential of elderly care robots, industry insiders told that stronger policy support is needed to scale up their production while keeping prices affordable for all.

{"content": "No one knows for sure how many bars exist on Earth, but there are likely millions of spots around the world where patrons can get a glass of wine or a bottle of beer. But within that number, how many offer cocktails that are served inside giant balloons, made from foraged ingredients, or topped with pastel-colored edible foam? And of all these wide and diverse alcohol-vending establishments, which ones are worth traveling for? That’s a question that the World’s 50 Best group tries every year to answer. The UK-based organization puts together an annual ranking of the world’s best bars and reveals the winners in October. For 2025, the No. 1 answer to that question is Hong Kong’s Bar Leone. This Italian spot in the fashionable Sheung Wan area is helmed by Rome native Lorenzo Antinori, who said he wanted the bar to feel “like my grandmother’s living room.” It is the first-ever bar in Asia to win the No. 1 spot. “Grazie mille!” he said as the bar’s name was called. “Our idea was try to be a neighborhood bar as much as possible,” Antinori said at a press conference after the ceremony. “We are living in times where consumers are seeking for comfort. There’s no smoke and mirrors. What you see on the menu is what you’re going to get.” The was announced at a splashy, cocktail-attire-please event in Hong Kong, where the hometown crowd seemed firmly on Bar Leone’s cheering squad. Second place went to Handshake Speakeasy, a Prohibition-inspired cocktail spot in Mexico City. It won the World’s Best Bar title last year. Sips in Barcelona earned the No. 3 ranking. One way to spot potential future honorees is to look at the list of the best bars, which was released on September 24. New entries to the list include New York City’s Schmuck (“effortlessly cool”), São Paulo’s Exímia (“a taste of Brazil in a glass”), and Taichung’s Vender (“disguised as one of Taiwan’s many vending machines”).

{"content": "It’s not an exaggeration to call Mid-Autumn Festival the world’s largest full moon party. Even Labubu, the wildly popular Pop Mart toy, has been known to . Falling on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, the festival is marked primarily across East and Southeast Asia as a night for families to gather, enjoy the harvest, light lanterns and admire what’s believed to be the roundest moon of the year. In 2025, the Mid-Autumn Festival, or the Moon Festival, is celebrated on October 6. You can count on plenty of mooncakes, pomelos and more moon-connected essentials as part of traditions marking the ancient holiday. Here’s what you need to know about the festival and a few tips on how to join the fun. Mid-Autumn Festival became an official celebration in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) but there isn’t one single answer to the question of when and how the annual event began. Many believe the fete was first mentioned in the “Book of Rites,” a Confucius classic on bureaucracy and rituals written more than 2,400 years ago. It was described as a day for emperors to celebrate the year’s harvest by giving offerings to the moon and hosting a great feast. Today, the Mid-Autumn Festival is an incredibly important family gathering — it’s when “people and the moon reunite to form a full circle,” as an old saying goes. Like many cultural celebrations, the Mid-Autumn Festival is shrouded in myth. One of the most beloved — and tragic — pieces of folklore tells the story of how a woman named Chang’e became the moon goddess. According to the legend, after mythological Chinese archer Hou Yi courageously shot down nine surplus suns — leaving only one, in effect protecting the world from being scorched completely — he was given an elixir from heaven as a reward. Hou Yi’s wife Chang’e drank the elixir while protecting it from a greedy apprentice, but became so light that she floated to the moon. Missing his wife, Hou Yi prepared a feast every year on the day when the moon was at its fullest, hoping to get a glimpse of his wife’s shadow. Just how well known is this story? , part of the country’s ambitious space program, were named in honor of the moon goddess. Meanwhile, Yutu (Jade Rabbit) — — was named after a legendary rabbit that was sent to accompany Chang’e to the moon. When it comes to celebrating the festival, customs vary throughout Asia. The Mid-Autumn Festival is considered “children’s day” in Vietnam and celebrations include paper lantern fairs and lion dance parades. Meanwhile, in southern China, most people will light a lantern and eat autumn fruits such as pomelo and starfruit. Some villages in Hong Kong still preserve the tradition of through a narrow alley. In South Korea, the Mid-Autumn Festival (or Chuseok) is one of the nation’s most important holidays. Celebrated over three days, South Koreans will sweep ancestors’ tombs, wear traditional attire and eat songpyeon, crescent-shaped steamed rice cakes with sweet fillings. Japanese people, meanwhile, will eat grilled sticky rice balls called tsukimi dango (“moon viewing”) while admiring the celestial body. Celebrations can also be found in Asian communities all over the world, from New York City to Vancouver. One of the biggest stars of the Mid-Autumn Festival is the — it’s as important to festivities as turkey is to Thanksgiving and latkes are to Hanukkah. In most places in China, the calorific pastry is sliced up and shared like a cake between families and friends. The most well-known kind of mooncake is made of lotus seed paste, salted egg yolk and lard — Cantonese style — which explains why a palm-sized cake can contain about 1,000 calories. Nuts, red beans and custards are some other popular ingredients. In China’s Guiyang City, the staff canteen of the Guizhou Provincial People’s Hospital  unexpectedly topped sales charts at a local supermarket with its decades‑old . Meanwhile in Xintai, in eastern Shandong province, mooncakes have become a lucrative income for the county. It’s reported to have generated 600 million yuan, about $84 million, in during the festival, accounting for roughly 1% of the county’s annual GDP. Bakery brands have also come up with modern variations — ice cream coated in chocolate, for example — that offer an alternative to those who aren’t fond of traditional mooncakes.", "tags": ["festival", "mid", "mooncakes", "autumn"]},
{"content": "When Brent Chapman was 13, he took ibuprofen during a Christmas basketball game. It was a drug he had taken before, but what happened next was anything but routine: He had a severe reaction that caused burns all over his body, including on the surface of his eyes. Chapman was in a coma for 27 days. He lost his left eye to an infection and lost most of his vision in the other. His body recovered, but his vision fully never returned. “For the last 20 years, I’ve been having close to 50 surgeries trying to save this eye, most of them cornea transplants,” Chapman said of his right eye. “We would put a new cornea in. It would last sometimes just a few months or even up to years, but it would just kind of never heal.” But Dr. Greg Moloney, clinical associate professor of corneal surgery at the University of British Columbia, was able to restore Chapman’s sight this year with a rare procedure that involved implanting Chapman’s own tooth into his eye. “I’m very happy and am just taking in the world again, appreciating the little things. It’s been kind of surreal and kind of a euphoric feeling to it,” Chapman said. The procedure, also known as tooth-in-eye or osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, involves removing a patient’s tooth, sewing a piece of it into the cheek and placing the structure into their eye. It’s considered a last resort. “It’s a situation where a standard corneal transplant simply won’t work,” said Dr. Vicente Diaz, assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual science at the Yale School of Medicine. Diaz was not involved with Chapman’s case but treats people who have , the rare and sometimes fatal drug reaction that caused Chapman’s blindness. The condition causes severe inflammation of the skin and mucous membranes, including the eyes. In some cases, Diaz said, the immune system attacks and destroys the limbal stem cells that are essential for keeping the cornea clear. Without these cells, corneal tissue becomes scarred and keratinized, as if the cornea has skin growing over it, blocking light from reaching the retina. Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be triggered by any medication or infection, although certain drugs such as seizure medications, gout medications and antibacterial sulfa drugs carry a higher risk. There are also certain that could put someone at a higher risk of developing the disorder. Diaz noted that it can occur at any point in a person’s life, even after previous exposure to the same trigger without incident. In a healthy eye, the cornea acts like a windshield, allowing light to pass through to the lens and then to the retina, where it is converted into electrical signals sent to the brain. The cornea’s clarity depends on adequate lubrication and a steady renewal of cells by limbal stem cells. In conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, those systems fail. When the cornea is permanently opaque and the eye rejects a cornea transplant, surgeons sometimes turn to tooth-in-eye surgery. A canine tooth, which is the longest tooth in the human mouth, is extracted from the jaw, along with a thin layer of bone around the tooth that provides support and blood, keeping it alive. The tooth is then shaved into a 4 millimeter-thick block and drilled to hold a plastic optical cylinder, explained Dr. Ben Kang, Chapman’s oral maxillofacial surgeon and division head of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery at Vancouver General Hospital. The shaved tooth, with the lens in place, is implanted into the patient’s cheek or eyelid for several months, allowing soft tissue to grow around it. “The tooth is a really ideal structure for holding a focusing element in place,” Moloney said. “It’s hard, it’s rigid, it survives in poor environments, and the body accepts it because it’s part of its own.” The next step is to make a hole in the front of the patient’s eye to create space for the new complex. Once the tooth-lens complex is integrated with living tissue, it is surgically attached to the front of the eye, replacing the damaged cornea’s function. Tissue from inside the patient’s mouth is used to cover the tooth part of the device, giving the new eye a pink shade. Light can then pass through the clear lens to the retina, enabling vision again, provided that everything behind the cornea — the retina and optic nerve— remains healthy. Moloney said there are two types of candidates for the surgery: people like Chapman, who have tried every other procedure, or those who are so severely affected by their initial disease that doctors know from the outset that other options won’t work. The surgery, which can take over 12 hours across two stages, is rare and performed by only a handful of specialists worldwide. But for people who qualify, success can mean regaining nearly normal vision. “It’s like watching people come out of a time capsule and reintroduce themselves to the world,” Moloney said. “It’s highly emotional for us.” Chapman’s tooth was extracted in February, and the structure was placed into his eye in June. His last surgery, which straightened the lens to correct visual distortion, took place August 5. Chapman was fitted with glasses on August 13 and now has 20/30 vision, meaning he can see details at a distance of 20 feet that a person with perfect vision can see at 30 feet. The first thing he saw after his surgery was the skyline from Moloney’s 16th-floor office. “It’s really indescribable, to be able to see the whole city and how there’s a whole world that’s just intersecting. When you’re blind or low-vision, you’re not seeing that, and you’re kind of in your head more. There’s a lot more mental chatter, and it can be difficult,” Chapman said. “Dr. Moloney and I made eye contact for the first time, and we both got quite emotional. I haven’t really made eye contact in 20 years.” Before the tooth-in-eye surgery, Chapman was close to giving up hope. “We definitely didn’t have any more options. The transplants were lasting such a short time, and they were becoming more risky to do surgically,” he said. “Emotionally, even when I would get a new one, I knew it wasn’t going to last. This opened a new door for me and a new chapter in my life. This also provides more stability.” Chapman is looking forward to traveling – with Japan being on the top of the list – but he wants to “just see the world and take it all in.” Chapman’s favorite sight? His niece and nephew. “I have a niece and a nephew that are 4 and 2. They’re just so cute and so much fun,” he said. He is also a massage therapist and is looking forward to working again. “I’ve had a lot of time off work in the last couple of years with surgeries. I can give back and help people in pain and not make everything about me, and I think psychologically, that’s very helpful.” Above all, Chapman said, he is excited to dream again and “to not be limited by the instability of this condition and be able to plan and think ahead.” “Before, I would always be afraid to plan because I’m afraid I’ll need emergency surgery or have an infection. It was so unpredictable, I would make these plans, and it would be heartbreaking when I couldn’t do them,” he said. Having “human connection again visually” is something that people take for granted but is very powerful for people with poor vision. “We’ve been with him since he was a teenage boy. He’s waited till he’s 34 to get that,” Moloney said. “We’ve all waited a long time.”", "tags": ["restores", "rare", "man", "eye", "decades", "surgery", "vision"]},
{"content": "Scientists believe intriguing leopard spots on a rock sampled by the Perseverance rover on Mars last year may have potentially been made by ancient life, NASA announced Wednesday. The team has also published a peer-reviewed paper in the journal about the new analysis, though they say further study is needed. “After a year of review, they have come back and they said, listen, we can’t find another explanation,” said Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy. “So this very well could be the clearest sign of life that we’ve ever found on Mars, which is incredibly exciting.” The sample, called Sapphire Canyon, was collected by the Perseverance rover from rocky outcrops on the edges of the Neretva Vallis river valley, a region sculpted by water that once flowed into Jezero Crater more than 3 billion years ago. The rover landed within the crater to explore the ancient lake site in February 2021, seeking rocks created or modified by water on Mars in the past. Perseverance drilled the Sapphire Canyon sample from an arrowhead-shaped rock called Cheyava Falls in July 2024. Although the sample is safely ensconced in a tube millions of miles away on Mars, scientists have remained intrigued by the rock because of its potential to reveal whether microscopic life ever existed on the red planet. “The discovery of a potential biosignature, or a feature or signature that could be consistent with biological processes, but that requires further work and study to confirm a biological origin is something that we’re sharing with you all today that grows from years of hard work, dedication and collaboration between over 1,000 scientists and engineers here at the (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory and our partner institutions around the country and internationally,” said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance project scientist at JPL, during a news conference Wednesday. Shortly after the rock was found, members of the Perseverance science team said it was exactly the type of rock they were hoping to find. NASA initially shared the Cheyava Falls rock discovery at the end of July 2024. The new announcement Wednesday is the result of a long, peer-reviewed research process and the collection of more data, said lead study author Joel Hurowitz, a planetary scientist at Stony Brook University in New York. Peer review and publication are crucial steps in the scientific process that allow NASA to make the mission data and the science team’s interpretation of that data available to the broader science community for further study, said Lindsay Hays, senior scientist for Mars Exploration at NASA’s Planetary Science Division. “Hopefully, eventually this will be followed by the delivery of these samples back to Earth where they could be studied in terrestrial labs,” Hays added. Perseverance rover surveyed the river valley after finding the sample to better understand the environment where the rocks were deposited and determine how the leopard spots may have formed, Hurowitz said. Understanding exactly how those spots came to be — whether through geochemical processes that don’t require life or due to the presence of microbial life — is a crucial step in determining whether the rock contains evidence of a potential biosignature. “Today, we are really showing you how we are kind of one step closer to answering humanity’s, one of their most profound questions, and that is, are we truly alone in the universe?” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. NASA’s Perseverance rover discovered a unique “leopard-spotted” rock on Mars in 2024, featuring unusual dark spots and ring-shaped features. Now, scientists say these formations have the clearest potential evidence of ancient life on the planet, though further study is needed to confirm a biological origin. More than 3.5 billion years ago, the Neretva Vallis would have been filled with rushing rivers carrying mud, sand and gravel into the lake, Stack Morgan said. “Inside the crater, this kind of energetic setting was probably punctuated by periods of calm when water would have backed up, creating a relatively low energy lake environment,” she added. When the water eventually dried up, it left behind the rocky outcrop where Cheyava Valls was found, called Bright Angel, preserving a record of a “potential habitable environment” on Mars, Stack Morgan said. “These really ancient rocks provide us the window into a period of time that’s not particularly well represented on our own planet Earth, but it’s a time when life was emergent on Earth, and could have been on Mars as well,” she added. Cheyava Falls, named for one of the Grand Canyon’s waterfalls, showcased small black spots nicknamed “poppy seeds” by Perseverance’s science team, as well as larger markings dubbed leopard spots. “These textural features told us that something really interesting had happened in these rocks, some chemical reactions occurred at the time they were being deposited,” Hurowitz said. The rover’s SHERLOC instrument, or Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals, also detected organic compounds in the rock. The SHERLOC results were a “smoking gun indicator for the presence of organic matter in this mud,” Hurowitz said. Organic compounds were also found in a couple of other locations in the Bright Angel formation. “This tells us that we had a rusty red mud that was deposited in the presence of organic matter,” Hurowitz said. On Earth, these carbon-based molecules are the building blocks of life. The mottling on the rock could indicate that ancient chemical reactions occurring within it once supported microbial organisms. White veins of calcium sulfate present clear evidence that water — crucial for life — once ran through the rock. And the irregular-shaped leopard spots, tested by the rover’s PIXL instrument, short for Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, detected iron and phosphate within the features. The team also spotted the potential presence of hematite between the white bands of calcium sulfate in the rock. Hematite is one of the minerals responsible for Mars’ signature red hue. The leopard spotting may have occurred when chemical reactions with hematite turned the rock from red to white, which can release iron and phosphate and potentially cause the black rings to form. Such reactions can also provide an energy source for microbes. The features are likely due to the presence of ferrous iron phosphate and iron sulfide, or the minerals vivianite and greigite, according to the researchers. Typically, these minerals form in environments with a low temperature and the presence of water. “On Earth, things like these sometimes form in sediments where microbes are eating organic matter and ‘breathing’ rust and sulfate,” said study coauthor Dr. Michael Tice, a geobiologist and astrobiologist in the department of geology and geophysics at Texas A&M University, in a statement. “Their presence on Mars raises the question: could similar processes have occurred there?” In the study, the authors explore two potential scenarios for how the rock features formed: due to the presence of life or without it. While it’s possible that some of the features could be produced strictly geochemically due to reactions between organic matter and iron, that process usually only works at relatively high temperatures — something the team does not see evidence of, Tice said. “All the ways we have of examining these rocks on the rover suggest that they were never heated in a way that could produce the leopard spots and poppy seeds,” Tice explained. “If that’s the case, we have to seriously consider the possibility that they were made by creatures like bacteria living in the mud in a Martian lake more than three billion years ago.” Cheyava Falls may have begun as a mixture of deposited mud and organic compounds that eventually cemented to become rock, according to the research. Later on, water may have penetrated through cracks in the rock, depositing minerals to create the calcium sulfate veins and leopard spots. “What’s exciting about these finds, this sort of combination of mud and organic matter that has reacted to produce these minerals and these textures, is that when we see features like this are often the byproduct of microbial metabolisms that are consuming organic matter and making these minerals as a result of those reactions,” Hurowitz said. Hurowitz also acknowledged that there are nonbiological ways to create features like the leopard spots. “What we need to do from here is to continue to do additional research in laboratory settings here on Earth, and ultimately bring the sample from this rock back home to Earth, so that we can make the final determination for what process actually gave rise to these fantastic textures,” he said. Scientists are still in the process of analyzing the geologic context of the sample, but the new paper represents an overview of how they currently understand the Cheyava Falls rock, Stack Morgan said. More papers are expected over the next year or so. “While we were exploring the Bright Angel area, we basically threw the entire rover science payload at this rock, and so we’re pretty close to the limits of what the rover can do on the surface in terms of making progress on that particular question,” Stack Morgan said. Since landing on Mars, Perseverance has crossed Jezero Crater and explored an ancient river delta in search of microfossils of past life. The rover has been collecting samples along the way that were intended to be returned to Earth by future missions. But it’s currently unclear how NASA would return the samples to Earth as the agency grapples with the White House’s proposal to by as much as half. “We’re looking at how we get the sample back, or other samples back,” Duffy said. “What we’re going to do is look at our budgets, we look at our timing, and you know, how do we spend money better, and you know, what technology do we have to get samples back more quickly? And so that’s a current analysis that’s happening right now.” To ultimately answer the question of whether life has ever existed on the red planet, returning the samples is necessary, scientists say. “Bringing this sample back to Earth would allow us to analyze it with instruments far more sensitive than anything we can send to Mars,” Tice said. “What’s fascinating is how life may have been making use of some of the same processes on Earth and Mars at around the same time. It’s a special and spectacular thing to be able to see them like this on another planet.” Sign up for .

{"content": "Surrounding our solar system is a natural and enigmatic cosmic shield called the heliosphere — and a new mission has launched to help astronomers better understand it. Created by the solar wind, a constant flow of charged particles that stream away from the sun, the acts as an enormous bubble that protects the planets in our solar system from cosmic radiation permeating the Milky Way, our home galaxy. In addition to Earth’s protective magnetic field, the heliosphere plays a major role in why life is possible on our planet — and how it perhaps once existed on others such as . Over half a dozen missions   have contributed to how astronomers understand the heliosphere, and two enduring spacecraft, the Voyager probes, have after exiting the heliosphere to explore interstellar space. But the new IMAP, or , mission is designed to investigate how the sun forms its solar wind, and how that solar wind interacts with interstellar space at the boundary of the heliosphere, which begins at a range three times the distance between Earth and Pluto, according to NASA. The spacecraft’s 10 instruments will also fill gaps in the existing map of the heliosphere, pieced together from data collected by previous missions, and help further explain how the heliosphere largely shields our solar system from damaging cosmic rays, the most highly energetic particles in the universe. Along with two other space weather missions that lifted off aboard the same rocket on Wednesday, IMAP will help scientists better predict when solar storms unleashed by the sun could affect our planet. When aimed at Earth, harsh radiation from the storms, also known as space weather, can pose risks to astronauts on the International Space Station as well as interfere with communications, the electric power grid, navigation, and radio and satellite operations. “This next set of missions is the ultimate cosmic carpool,” said Dr. Joe Westlake, director of NASA’s Heliophysics Division, during a news conference on Sunday. “They will provide unprecedented insight into space weather. Every human on Earth, as well as nearly every system involved in space exploration and human needs, is affected by space weather.” The heliosphere was first theorized by multiple scientists investigating the concept of cosmic rays and the solar wind in the late 1950s, according to . They believed the sun provided a web of magnetic fields and solar wind that surrounding Earth and the rest of the solar system. , the first successful mission to another planet that performed a flyby of Venus in 1962, also was the first to measure the solar wind, proving its existence. Direct measurements taken by the in the 1970s, as well as the Voyager probes, provided further proof of the heliosphere. Scientists are eager to know what the boundaries of the heliosphere look like, something that the Voyager probes have offered tantalizing glimpses of in the past. They are the only two spacecraft to cross the heliosphere. Voyager 1 reached the heliosphere boundary in 2012, while the slower Voyager 2 crossed the boundary in 2018, providing snapshots in two specific locations. The information collected by these probes is helping scientists learn about the heliosphere’s cometlike shape. The IBEX, or Interstellar Boundary Explorer, satellite has been mapping the heliosphere since launching in 2008. But IMAP can explore and map the boundaries of the heliosphere like never before because it has instruments with faster imaging that are capable of 30 times higher resolution. Once it reaches an orbit about 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth in about three months, IMAP will also capture observations of the solar wind in real time and measure particles that travel from the sun, study the heliosphere’s boundary between 6 billion and 9 billion miles (9.7 billion to 14.5 billion kilometers) away, and even collect data from interstellar space. Predominately, IMAP will measure energetic neutral atoms, called ENAs, or uncharged particles that form when an energetic charged ion collides with a slow-moving neutral atom. The process that forms these particles, found wherever there is plasma, or charged gas, in space, also occurs throughout the heliosphere and along its boundary. IMAP will rely on tracking these particles to create a more complete map of the heliosphere, according to NASA. The particles travel in a straight line, unaffected by magnetic fields because they are not charged, so IMAP can collect ENAs near Earth and trace them to their origins, like the otherwise invisible boundaries of the heliosphere, according to NASA. “IMAP is going to make incredibly detailed pictures that will evolve over time of that interaction region,” said Dr. David McComas, IMAP’s principal investigator and an astrophysicist at Princeton University. “It will be able to understand what the shielding is, how the shielding works and what it looks like.” McComas added that our solar system is not alone in having something like a heliosphere, and bright have been spotted around other stars. IMAP launched alongside NASA’s Carruthers Geocorona Observatory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s SWFO-L1, or Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. ET. NASA streamed the launch live on . The is a small satellite that will be dedicated to observing the exosphere, or Earth’s outermost atmospheric layer. The Carruthers mission will capture images of the region’s faint ultraviolet glow, called the geocorona, to help answer questions about the exosphere’s shape, size and density. The mission is named for Dr. George Carruthers, who developed an ultraviolet camera as the first moon-based observatory that was placed during the Apollo 16 mission. The camera, still in place in the Descartes highland region on the moon, photographed Earth in ultraviolet light and captured the first image of the exosphere in 1972. The Carruthers mission will measure changes and the effects of space weather once it reaches Earth, given that the exosphere marks a transitional boundary between Earth and space. Meanwhile, the is intended to act as a solar storm detector, providing early warnings to protect astronauts in low-Earth orbit and satellites that provide critical communications on Earth. It’s a tool that will be even more necessary as astronauts venture farther into deep space. “I think we’re getting better…but a really solid forecast, I think, is still something that we’re striving for,” said Mark Clampin, acting deputy associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, at a news conference for the agency’s upcoming Artemis II mission around the moon. “And obviously the missions that we’re putting up now will give us much better insight into not just the one piece of the problem, but the whole problem, from what’s happening on the sun to how that then propagates out from the sun, and whether it becomes a real problem or not.” The satellite’s compact coronagraph telescope will monitor the sun for activity and measure the solar wind, providing a constant stream of data to NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center. Images of solar storms taken by the satellite can be sent to the center within 30 minutes, while other current missions, like NASA and the European Space Agency’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, launched in 1995, can take up to eight hours. “SWFO-L1’s essential data is our lifeline for keeping the lights on, planes flying and satellites safe, ensuring that America is ready for what the sun sends our way ,” said Clinton Wallace, director of NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center.

{"content": "Astronomers have detected a collision between two black holes in unprecedented detail, offering the clearest view yet into the nature of these cosmic oddities and confirming long-held predictions made by legendary physicists Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. The event, dubbed GW250114, became known in January when researchers spotted it with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) — a set of two identical instruments located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. The instruments detected gravitational waves, faint ripples in space-time produced by the two black holes slamming into each other. Searching for gravitational waves, phenomena predicted in 1915 as part of Einstein’s theory of relativity, is the only way to identify black hole collisions from Earth. Einstein believed that the waves would be too weak to ever be picked up by human technology, but , LIGO for the very first time, later netting a Nobel Prize for three scientists who made key contributions to the development of this “ .” The newly detected black holes were each around 30 to 35 times the mass of the sun, and they were spinning very slowly, said Maximiliano Isi, an assistant professor of astronomy at Columbia University and an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City. Isi led a new for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration on the GW250114 data, which published Wednesday in the journal Physical Review Letters. “The black holes were about 1 billion light years away, and they were orbiting around each other in almost a perfect circle,” Isi said. “The resulting black hole was around 63 times the mass of the sun, and it was spinning at 100 revolutions per second.” These characteristics make the merger an almost exact replica of that first, groundbreaking detection from 10 years ago, according to Isi. “But now, because the instruments have improved so much since then, we can see these two black holes with much greater clarity, as they approached each other and merged into a single one,” he added. Isi said the observation gives scientists a totally new view into “the dynamics of space and time.” LIGO, which also has two smaller sister instruments — Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan — is managed by a global scientific of about 1,600 researchers. It works by detecting tiny stretches in space caused by the gravitational waves that amount to “a change in distance that is 1,000 times smaller than the radius of the nucleus of an atom,” as Isi puts it. Scientists have used it to observe over 300 black hole mergers so far. Earlier this year, the instrument detected the to date between two black holes approximately 100 and 140 times the mass of the sun. Since it debuted, some of LIGO’s key components — including its lasers and mirrors — have been upgraded to increase accuracy and reduce background noise. This improved performance made its new observation over three times more precise than the inaugural one a decade ago. That unprecedented clarity allowed astronomers to use GW250114 to confirm predictions about black holes made decades ago by prominent physicists. The first prediction, devised by New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr in 1963, builds upon Einstein’s theory of general relativity, and states that black holes should be paradoxically simple objects, described by a single equation. “Yes, black holes are very mysterious, complex and have important implications to the evolution of the universe,” Isi said, “but mathematically we think they should be fully described by just two numbers. Everything there is to know about them should come from how big the black hole is — or what its mass is — and how fast it’s rotating.” To test this theory, the researchers used a unique feature of black hole collisions: a “ringing” or vibration — like a bell that’s been struck — that the final black hole produces. “If you have a bell and you strike it with a hammer, it will ring,” Isi noted. “The pitch and duration of the sound, the characteristics of the sound, tell you something about what the bell is made of. With black holes something similar happens — they ring in gravitational waves.” This ringing includes information about the structure of the black hole and the space around it, Isi added. Although the phenomenon was faintly observed before, GW250114 returned a signal with “two modes … a fundamental mode and an overtone” with much more clarity. “We identified two components of this ringing, and that allowed us to test that this black hole really is consistent with being described by just two numbers, mass and rotation,” he said. “And this is fundamental to our understanding of how space and time works — that these black holes should be featureless, in some way. It’s the first time we are able to see this so compellingly.” The second prediction confirmed by GW250114 is one made in 1971 by British physicist Stephen Hawking, which states that when two black holes merge, the resulting surface area must be equal to or greater than that of the original black holes. “It’s a profound, but very simple theorem that says the total surface area of a black hole can never decrease — it can only get bigger or stay the same,” Isi said. Although previous LIGO observations offered tentative of the theorem, the clarity of this new signal gives researchers unparalleled confidence, Isi said. “Because we’re able to identify the portion of the signal that comes from the black holes early on, as they are separated from each other, we can infer their areas from that,” he explained. “Then we can look at the very final portion of the signal that comes from the final black hole, and measure its own area.” Just like Kerr’s equation, Hawking’s theorem also uses Einstein’s work as its foundation: “Einstein’s theories are like the operating system for all of this,” Isi explained. Kip Thorne, one of the three recipients of the Nobel Prize for LIGO contributions, said Hawking called him as soon as he learned of the 2015 gravitational wave detection to ask if LIGO would be able to test his theorem. “If Hawking were alive, he would have reveled in seeing the area of the merged black holes increase,” Thorne said of the esteemed physicist, who died in 2018, in a statement about the new findings. It’s remarkable how this seminal, theoretical work is being confirmed decades later with advanced instruments, Isi said. And confirming Hawking’s equation, he added, could have implications for a very sought-after goal in physics — combining the seemingly incompatible theory of general relativity, which describes gravity, with quantum mechanics, which relates to the subatomic world. “LIGO has created an entire new branch of astronomy. It has revolutionized what we think about compact objects, black holes in particular,” he said. “Before LIGO turned on, people weren’t even sure that black holes could merge and crash and form in this way.” Gravitational waves are very weak, and the titanic task of detecting them is often described as looking for a needle in a haystack, according to Emanuele Berti, a professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the study. He described the LIGO detectors as “hearing aids” that help with this process. “A large group of scientists spent the last ten years improving those hearing aids, and now we can ‘hear’ the signals with much higher clarity,” he said in an email. “We can now test fundamental principles of gravity that we could not test ten years ago.” Among these principles, he added, is the idea that black holes are the simplest macroscopic objects in the universe. The level of detail in the “ringing” produced by the GW250114 collision means scientists can say with confidence that the final object is consistent with the black holes predicted by Einstein’s general relativity, which Berti says is “terribly exciting.” Leor Barack, a professor of mathematical physics at the University of Southampton in England who was also not part of the study, noted that among the more than 300 black-hole merger events recorded by LIGO, the latest one stands out as “particularly spectacular,” and calls the new study a long-awaited analysis. Scientists were able to extract two of the “pure tones” of the remnant black hole as it settled into its final form, Barack added. “This included, for the first time, a clear extraction of the first ‘overtone,’ a fainter harmonious sound of the ringing hole, in addition to the primary tone,” he said. “This kind of test is the most precise to date, by a long margin.” The study represents a significant milestone in gravitational wave astronomy, said Macarena Lagos, an assistant professor at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile. Lagos also was not involved with the work. She agreed that the detection of a second tone in the “ringing” black hole is particularly significant, adding that GW250114 demonstrates the success of LIGO’s ongoing improvements and shows that gravitational wave detections can test fundamental physics in ways never before possible. “While current tests of gravity still have broad uncertainties, this work lays the groundwork for future detections” of even better quality expected in the coming years, Lagos said in an email. “These future observations promise to provide more precise tests of our understanding of spacetime and gravity.” Sign up for .

{"content": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story ran on May 6. It was updated following the auction’s postponement. Sotheby’s has postponed the controversial sale of a dazzling cache of jewels linked to the remains of the Buddha after India’s government slammed the auction and called for the gems’ return. In a statement emailed to CNN on Wednesday, the auction house said its decision came “in light of the matters” raised by officials in India, where the jewels were dug up more than a century ago by a British colonial official. The postponement, which Sotheby’s said was agreed to by the sellers, will “allow for discussions between the parties,” the statement added. The collection of “gem relics” — including amethysts, pearls, carnelians, shell and embossed gold sheets — was set to go up for auction in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Described by Sotheby’s auction house as having “unparalleled religious, archaeological and historical importance,” the gem relics are considered sacred by many Buddhists, who believe they are the corporeal remains of the Buddha. “Nothing of comparable importance in early Buddhism has ever appeared at auction,” Sotheby’s had earlier said on its website. The web page dedicated to the sale has since been taken down. The gems were being sold by three descendants of William Claxton Peppé, a British colonial engineer who made the extraordinary discovery in the village of Piprahwa after excavating part of his estate in northern India in 1898. Though the Buddha was born in what is now Nepal, he became enlightened, first preached, and died in neighboring India. On Monday, India’s Ministry of Culture said it was taking “swift and comprehensive” measures to “immediately” stop the sale and “highlight the illegality of the auction and ensure compliance with international laws.” It also called on Sotheby’s to “return these sacred artifacts to their rightful place.” In a brief statement posted to Facebook on Wednesday, the ministry welcomed the auction house’s decision to postpone the sale, adding: “Further details will be shared in due course.” Peppé’s Birdpur estate was located in what is now northern Uttar Pradesh, about 20 kilometers from Lumbini, the Buddha’s birthplace across the border in Nepal. His excavation of the site uncovered an ancient Buddhist stupa and a huge sandstone sarcophagus-like tomb. Inside the cavern were five vessels containing about 1,800 gemstones and precious metals, dating to around 240 BCE, and small pieces of bone and ash. An inscription on one of the urns indicated the remains belonged to the Buddha, who had his ashes buried at eight separate sites following his death around 480 BCE. Historians the site was the first credible find of the Buddha’s relics in modern times and captured the imagination of Buddhist scholars and devotees ever since. “These gem relics (in all likelihood contributed by the Buddha’s clansmen), are, by association, as valuable as the ash and bone pieces (of the Buddha) themselves that were found alongside them,” said Karam Tej S. Sarao, former professor and head of the department of Buddhist Studies at the University of Delhi. The gems put up for auction were a small portion of the original find. Following the discovery, the bone and ash fragments were gifted by the British to King Chulalongkorn of Siam, now Thailand. They are now spread across important Buddhist sites in Thailand, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Most of the gems were sent to an Indian museum in Kolkata, according to the Indian government, and a fifth of the total find — consisting of duplicates of the main collection — were retained by Peppé. The upcoming sale of the gems handed down to Peppé’s descendants had sparked criticism among several historians. “There is a limit to greed. Commercialization… of the relic gems must be stopped,” said Sarao, the former professor. “The gems should be immediately handed over to the Indian government” to be “enshrined in the Piprahwā Stūpa where they belong,” he added. Curator Conan Cheong and Professor Ashley Thompson of SOAS, University of London, both specialists in Southeast Asian Buddhist art, wrote in a that the sale amounted to “perpetuating colonial violence.” The relics are considered the “corporeal remains imbued with the living presence of the Buddha” and so, “for the Buddhists who deposited them, as for many Buddhists today, gems, bone and ash are all relics,” they wrote. Chris Peppé, great grandson of William Claxton Peppé, and two of his cousins now have possession of the gem relics. Since inheriting them in 2013, the family have “sought to make them available for viewing by the public (ideally a Buddhist public).” Through the , the family has made research on the gem relics available to the public and the gems have been exhibited in museums around the world. Prior to the auction’s postponement, Chris Peppé told CNN that his family believe the 334 items in their possession should go to Buddhists. “Despite exhibitions in major museums including the Met, there has been relatively little interest from the public (including Buddhists) in the gems. Choosing temples and museums for donation all presented different problems on closer scrutiny,” he said. “The auction seems to have finally brought the gems into the spotlight and may present the fairest and most transparent way to transfer this small part of the original find to Buddhists. Chris Peppé said 25% of the proceeds from the auction were due to be donated to “Buddhist institutions” and a further 25% to the display of the main Piprahwa collection in Kolkata, which has never been exhibited to the public.

{"content": "Peloton is unveiling a sweeping revamp of its portfolio with a focus on artificial intelligence as the once-hot fitness company looks to kickstart growth. On Wednesday, the company is releasing five products, including a cheaper base model and more expensive “plus” versions of its bike and treadmill as well as a new rowing machine — all of which have a new swiveling screen so users can take strength, yoga and other classes. The equipment also has upgraded speakers and improved Wi-Fi connectivity, while the bike has an improved seat in response to consumers’ complaints. The “plus” versions of its bike, treadmill and rowing machine have a new feature called Peloton IQ, an AI-assisted feature that acts like a personal trainer offering feedback on users’ form, plus rep counting and suggestions on weights and workout plans. Prices have also gone up, with the Bike now costing $1,695 (a $150 increase), and the Bike+ costing $2,695 (a $200 increase). The base model of the treadmill has also increased by $300, to $3,295; and the Tread+ now costs $6,695, a whopping $700 increase. The monthly membership price has also increased for the first time in three years, by $5, to $49.99. All products are now on sale at Peloton’s website, with “select” equipment available at Dick’s Sporting Goods and Amazon. Peloton has experimented with AI for the past few years, notably with the , a $495 attachable camera that offered feedback, but which is no longer on sale. The “company learned a lot from that product,” said Chief Product Officer Nick Caldwell, noting that users wanted those tools integrated “more deeply” in the equipment. Caldwell also said he thinks Peloton’s relaunch will entice new people to the brand because these products are “meaningfully different.” “A lot of people still think of us as a bike company, even though our number-two modality is strength,” he told CNN. “I think by putting strength right on the product, it makes it very clear that we’re multi-modality.” It’s the first major change rolled out under Peloton CEO Peter Stern, a former Ford Motor Company and Apple executive, who has the Herculean task of transforming the company. Peloton’s last product launch was in 2022 with the release of a $3,200 rowing machine. Stern is focusing on broadening the company’s reputation from being known for just cardio (even as previous attempts ) as well as attracting new customers ahead of the holiday shopping season. The stock has lost more than 90% of its value since the height of the pandemic, when Peloton soared in popularity, with the company likely hoping to recapture just a fraction of that magic. Shares jumped more than 5% in premarket trading. At least one analyst thinks the sweeping changes can give Peloton a boost. “We look favorably upon efforts on the part of new senior leadership at Peloton to reinvigorate the brand and cater to a wider array of target consumers,” Brian Nagel, senior equity research analyst at Oppenheimer, told CNN. He added that while “risks remain” for Peloton, “we very much believe that there exists a compelling lane within the health and fitness space for a better-run, better-capitalized Peloton to ultimately succeed.” Since Stern began his role in January, he has instituted a number of changes to try to get the company back on track, from slashing costs to shifting its marketing message. Last month, Peloton laid off about 6% of its workforce as part of a $100 million cost-cutting effort. Stern at the time that the company’s expenses “remain too high, which hinders our ability to invest in our future.” The savings, he added, would be used to fund “strength and additional wellness offerings.” Stern took over from former Spotify executive Barry McCarthy, who had a tumultuous two-year stint from early 2022, when he Peloton founder John Foley, until his . McCarthy slashed thousands of jobs and stopped building its equipment in-house. He also hiked prices, and redesigned its fitness app with a free tier — the latter of which ultimately failed. However, a clothing collaboration with , and Peloton continues to sell its products with outside retailers, both McCarthy’s initiatives. In June, the company named its fourth chief marketing officer in five years — a signal that its advertising wasn’t resonating with consumers. Peloton discontinued its featuring NFL brothers T.J. and J.J. Watt, as an attempt to appeal to men. A new advertising campaign will be unveiled, tied to this launch. Major recalls were also a blemish. The company paid a $19 million fine in 2023 after the Consumer Product Safety Commission levied “one of the largest civil penalties in its history” following a of 125,000 unsafe Peloton treadmills.", "tags": ["peloton", "relaunch", "product", "ai"]},
{"content": "Following a request from the US Department of Justice, Apple has removed ICEBlock and similar apps that allow people to alert others nearby about sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their area. President Donald Trump and his administration have railed against the apps for months, arguing that they pose a threat to ICE agents. In an email to ICEBlock creator Joshua Aaron, Apple wrote that “upon re-evaluation,” the app does not comply with its app store guidelines around “objectionable” and “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content,” according to a copy of the message viewed by CNN. “Information provided to Apple by law enforcement shows that your app violates” the app store guidelines because “it’s purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group,” the email states. Aaron the ICEBlock app was intended to help people avoid contact with ICE agents. FBI Director Kash Patel last month that a man planned the attack for weeks and “searched apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.” Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, said in June, “An app that lets anyone zero in on their locations is like inviting violence against them.” ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond Friday to requests for comment. The Justice Department pointed to a statement from US Attorney General Pam Bondi saying that ICEBlock and similar apps crossed a line. The statement and removal of the apps was first reported by . “ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed,” Bondi said in the statement. ICEBlock and similar apps have been available on Apple’s app store since the spring. Apple, in a statement, said the company removed the apps Thursday after communication with law enforcement. The company didn’t specifically cite ICE or DHS, but Bondi told Fox that the Justice Department reached out to Apple, “demanding” the company remove the apps. “We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,” Apple said in a statement. “Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.” Apple and its CEO Tim Cook have in recent months sought to strengthen the company’s relationship with the White House, amid policy changes from Trump that could threaten its business. Aaron, the ICEBlock creator, has to incite violence against law enforcement. In a statement to CNN Friday, Aaron said he is “incredibly disappointed by Apple’s actions today” and called the claim that ICEBlock was designed to harm law enforcement officers “patently false.” The app had more than 1 million users prior to its removal, according to Aaron. The app was only available on Apple’s iOS, because Aaron previously said he would not be able to guarantee anonymity for users on Android. “ICEBlock is no different from crowdsourcing speed traps, which every notable mapping application, including Apple’s own Maps app, implements as part of its core services,” he said. “This is protected speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. We are determined to fight this with everything we have.” Aaron told CNN in June that he hoped the crowdsourced notifications would help people avoid interactions with ICE. When users log a sighting in the ICEBlock app, it warns: “Please note that the use of this app is for information and notification purposes only. It is not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.” “Our mission has always been to protect our neighbors from the terror this administration continues to (rain) down on the people of this nation,” he said in his Friday statement. But the White House has repeatedly admonished the apps and the media coverage about them. After CNN reported about ICEBlock in June, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt sharply criticized CNN, saying at a news briefing that it was “unacceptable that a major network would promote such an app that is encouraging violence against law enforcement officers who are trying to keep our country safe.” In a statement at the time, CNN denied it was promoting the app. “This is an app that is publicly available to any iPhone user who wants to download it,” a CNN spokesperson said. “There is nothing illegal about reporting the existence of this or any other app, nor does such reporting constitute promotion or other endorsement of the app by CNN.” Trump had threatened Apple, specifically, with steep tariffs for making its iPhone overseas, but Cook has gained favor with Trump in recent months after the company announced hundreds of billions of dollars in manufacturing investment in the United States. Trump has since limited the potential damage to Apple after exempting certain electronic products from tariffs following pledges from Cook.

{"content": "Meta will soon use what people tell its artificial intelligence chatbot to get even better at selling them things. The company said on Wednesday that users’ chats and interactions with Meta AI will soon be used to target them with even more personalized ads. Users will start seeing notices of the change next week, but it won’t kick in until December 16. Meta already targets users with ads based on what they post and click on, as well as who they’re connected to, on its social media platforms. That data enables Meta to infer what users might buy. But in conversations with Meta’s chatbot, users could directly tell the company about what they’re shopping for or the trip they’ll soon be packing for or what problems they have that a product could solve. The company will also use data from Meta AI to help decide what kinds of content users see on its site. Meta says, for example, that if a user talks to the chatbot about hiking, it will know they’re interested in the sport and serve them more hiking-related content. But the change also ups the pressure on Meta to prevent personal or difficult conversations with the AI — for example, about a relationship, given how many people now — from prompting potentially harmful content recommendations. “Just like other personalized services, we tailor the ads and content you see based on your activity, ensuring that your experience evolves as your interests change,” Meta said in its Wednesday blog post announcing the change. “Many people expect their interactions to make what they see more relevant. Soon, interactions with AIs will be another signal we use to improve people’s experience.” Meta AI has 1 billion monthly users, according to the company, although it’s not clear how regularly those users engage with it. Users can talk to the chatbot via Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or the standalone Meta AI app. And the company is already raking in huge sums from its advertising business. Last quarter alone, $46.5 billion from advertising revenue, up more than 21% from the same period in the prior year. Meta’s shares ( ) are up nearly 20% since the start of this year, bringing its market cap to $1.8 trillion as of October 1. But people will increasingly want to do their online shopping via AI chatbots, rather than by searching on Google or scrolling social media. Meta rival OpenAI on Monday the ability for users to buy select items directly through its own chatbot, ChatGPT, although it is not currently an ads-based business. Meta users will still have the option to use its to add or remove topics for targeted ads, and the company offers for users to control content on their Facebook and Instagram feeds. Meta also said it won’t deliver personalized ads based on conversations with the chatbot regarding religious views, sexual orientation, political views, health, racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership, in keeping with its larger policy not to target users based on those categories. (To be clear, Meta still allows ads related to these topics; it just doesn’t target users based on their perceived interest in them.)

Meta later added a pop-up that alerted users before they publicly posted an AI conversation on a feed called Discover. That feed was with “Vibes,” an endless scrolling feed of user-created, AI-generated videos.

{"content": "After an artificial intelligence-generated “actress” drew intense backlash from human actors, the character’s maker says it’s not meant to replace people. But many in Hollywood aren’t buying it. It’s just the latest movie-industry feud over a technology that many creatives worry has stolen their work and could eventually replace them. “Tilly Norwood” looks like a young woman with wavy brown hair and clear skin who, since February, has posted on Instagram much like any other Gen Z influencer. She’s pursuing an acting career — and recently posted about doing “screen tests” in hopes of landing a gig. But Tilly Norwood isn’t a real person, she’s AI-generated, created by Eline Van Der Velden, founder of AI startup Particle6, which says it creates “digital content” for film and TV. In a recent post, AI Tilly bragged that “in 20 seconds I fought monsters, fled explosions, sold you a car, and nearly won an Oscar. All in a day’s work… literally! Find yourself an actress who can do it all,” along with the hashtag #AIActress. But the project sparked a flurry of criticism after Hollywood news outlet Deadline that talent agents were looking to sign Tilly as an actress and that movie studios are quietly embracing AI-generated content. The Tilly Instagram account racked up hundreds of angry comments, including from some of Hollywood’s biggest names. “Wow … no thanks,” Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner said in one comment. “This is incredibly thoughtless and frankly disturbing,” wrote actor Cameron Cowperthwaite, who appeared in “Shameless” and “American Horror Story.” “I hope this backfires in every way humanly and well… Non humanly possible.” Ralph Ineson, who acted in “Nosferatu” and other films, responded to news of the project with a concise : “F**k off.” In a statement to both her and Tilly’s Instagram accounts, Van Der Velden responded to the backlash by saying Tilly is not meant to replace human actors. “To those who have expressed anger over the creation of our AI character Tilly Norwood: she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work — a piece of art,” Van Der Velden said. “Just as animation, puppetry, or CGI opened fresh possibilities without taking away from live acting, AI offers another way to imagine and build stories.” She added: “AI characters should be judged as part of their own genre, on their own merits, rather than compared directly to human actors.” But that may be cold comfort to the actors who argue AI creations like Tilly couldn’t exist without their work. Hollywood actors, writers, directors and others in the industry have raised alarms for years that their work was used to train AI models without consent or compensation and could then be used to make movies, TV shows or commercials without paying human creatives. “You didn’t make this. Hundreds of real workers, real photographers, camera operators, heck, even farmers, made this. You took their work and pretended it was yours,” Mara Wilson, known for films such as “Matilda” and “Mrs. Doubtfire,” said in a comment on another Tilly post. Van Der Velden did not immediately respond to a request for further comment from CNN. Anxieties around AI were central to the ’ and ’ strikes that disrupted Hollywood in 2023. Both Hollywood unions agreements that included protections around how major studios and streaming services can use AI. However, those agreements can’t stop other people from using AI tools — trained by hoovering up much of the internet — to generate work that’s reminiscent of a human actor or an existing movie scene. Top media companies have begun to go after AI companies for generating content that they say infringes on their intellectual property. Disney and Universal in June, accusing the photo and video generator of illegally training its AI on their materials and then spitting out unauthorized recreations of beloved characters like Bart Simpson and Wall-E.

{"content": "Indian author Banu Mushtaq and translator Deepa Bhasthi won the International Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday for “Heart Lamp,” a collection of 12 short stories written over a period of more than 30 years and which chronicle the everyday lives and struggles of women in southern India. The award was announced by bestselling Booker Prize-longlisted author Max Porter in his role as chair of the five-member voting panel, at a ceremony at London’s Tate Modern. It is the first time the award has been given to a collection of short stories. Bhasthi is the first Indian translator — and ninth female translator — to win the prize since it took on its current form in 2016. Mushtaq is the sixth female author to be awarded the prize since then. Written in Kannada, which is spoken by around 65 million people, primarily in southern India, Porter praised the “radical” nature of the translation, adding that “It’s been a joy” to listen to the evolving appreciation of the stories by members of the jury. “These beautiful, busy, life-affirming stories rise from Kannada, interspersed with the extraordinary socio-political richness of other languages and dialects,” said Porter. ”It speaks of women’s lives, reproductive rights, faith, caste, power and oppression.” The book, which beat five other finalists, comprises stories written from 1990 to 2023. They were selected and curated by Bhasthi, who was keen to preserve the multilingual nature of southern India in her translation.

{"content": "Nike has launched its first ever collaboration with an Indian fashion label, unveiling a range of patterned sportswear inspired by the country’s ancient tie-dying techniques. Created alongside Delhi-based brand NorBlack NorWhite, the colorful footwear and apparel collection “invites women into sport” while celebrating “Indian culture and craftsmanship,” according to a Nike press release. The brands’ new campaign, unveiled this week, features Indian cricketers Jemimah Rodrigues and Shafali Verma, alongside wrestler Anshu Malik and sprinter Priya Mohan. Accompanying images, shot by celebrated fashion photographer Bharat Sikka, show the female athletes posing in the historic city of Jaipur — including on its iconic stepwells. The move signals Nike’s renewed ambitions for a market in which it has experienced mixed fortunes since entering, via a licensing deal, in 1995. After established a wholly owned subsidiary nine years later, the company gambled heavily on the country’s most popular sport, cricket, beating rivals Adidas and Reebok to a 1.97-billion-rupee (then $44 million) deal to outfit the Indian national team in 2005. But Nike has since struggled to make commercial inroads, with local media in 2019 that it had slashed the number of stores in India to 150, down from a peak of 350. The brand’s website directory currently lists just 93 stores in India, compared to more than 2,600 in mainland China, a market of comparable population. The sportwear giant also appears to be its women’s apparel business, which has traditionally lagged behind its menswear. Several recent campaigns have spotlighted female athletes, with this year’s Super Bowl ad featuring WNBA star Caitlin Clark and Olympic sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson. The collection with female-owned NorBlack NorWhite features a hoodie, tank top, T-shirt and sports bras, as well as a cross-body bag and several pairs of sneakers, including a variation of the popular Air Max range. The items’ patterned motifs nod to “bandhani,” a hand-dying technique — thought to date back 5,000 years — used on the subcontinent to produce vibrant, geometric shapes on woven cloth. It is a technique that NorBlack NorWhite has into its designs. Founded by Canadian-born designers Mriga Kapadiya and Amrit Kumar, following their relocation to India in 2010, the label is known for combining streetwear with local craft traditions. In a statement, published via Nike’s website, Kapadiya said the brand “started with a deep admiration for the crafts practices of India and the people who bring them to life.” “This collection shines a light on the rigor, dedication and ancestral knowledge that’s rooted in Indian culture,” she added, “and we hope each piece inspires women to draw into their own athletic mindset while navigating everyday life in India and around the world.”", "tags": ["old", "technique", "collaboration", "design", "year", "indian", "tie", "nods"]},
{"content": "The world’s highest railway bridge, an ambitious piece of engineering across a mountain valley in Kashmir, was opened Friday by Prime Minister Narenda Modi, just weeks after a deadly tourist massacre in the Himalayan region sparked a brief conflict with neighboring Pakistan. Modi’s visit to India-administered Kashmir was his first since a brief but deadly conflict between India and Pakistan in April. The nuclear-armed neighbors traded missiles, drones, and artillery shelling for four days after New Delhi blamed the massacre on its neighbor, which Pakistan denies. Decades in the making, the arched Chenab Bridge sits 359 meters (about 1,180 feet) above the river of the same name – that’s 29 meters (over 95 feet) higher than the top of the Eiffel Tower. Costing more than $160 million with a length of 1,315 meters (4,314 feet), the bridge is part of the first railway link between Kashmir and the rest of India. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government has moved to integrate the Muslim-majority region with the rest of the country, including revoking a constitutional provision that allowed it to set its own laws in 2019. The Himalayan region of Kashmir is claimed by India, Pakistan and China. All three administer a part of the region, one of the most militarized zones in the world. In addition to the Chenab Bridge, Modi also inaugurated the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link project, which connects key cities in India-administered Kashmir to the rest of India. For Modi, who swept to power more than a decade ago on a ticket of nationalism and a promise of future greatness, investments in infrastructure like the Chenab Bridge and the broader rail link project can be seen as a powerful tool for social integration and political influence. Since he was first elected in 2014, the prime minister has rapidly expanded the region’s road and rail connectivity, building networks that connect disparate towns with major cities. In 2019, New Delhi revoked a constitutional provision giving India-administered Kashmir the autonomy to set its own laws. The southern and eastern portions of the region known previously as the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir became two separate union territories, bringing them under direct control of New Delhi – a move would promote stability, reduce corruption and boost the economy. The Chenab Bridge is being hailed as a major win for Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party government. His administration has poured billions into upgrading India’s old and outdated transport network, part of its vision to transform the country into a developed nation by 2047. Among these ambitious projects is the construction of several tunnels and highways in the mountainous Himalayan region which has been criticized by some environmentalists who say the heavy construction could damage fragile topography already feeling the effects from the climate crisis. Modi’s Char Dham Highway project, a multimillion-dollar infrastructure plan to improve connectivity in the state of Uttarakhand, came under fire in November 2023 when an under-construction mountain tunnel collapsed, trapping dozens of workers inside for several days with little water and oxygen. In August that year, more than a dozen workers were killed after a bridge under construction collapsed in the northeastern state of Mizoram. In June, a four-lane concrete bridge that was being built across the River Ganges in the eastern state of Bihar collapsed for the second time in just over a year, raising questions about the quality of its construction.", "tags": ["kashmir", "conflict", "bridge", "railway", "world", "highest", "opens"]},
{"content": "When Prada sent several pairs of brown sandals with distinctive toe rings and intricate stitching down its menswear runway in last month, observers were quick to point out their resemblance to a centuries-old piece of Indian heritage. The storied Italian fashion house may have presented the shoes as a new luxury creation, but many in India simply saw a pair of Kolhapuri chappals — traditional hand-crafted sandals with roots stretching back to the 12th or 13th century. Prada’s initial failure to acknowledge the inspiration behind the shoes, which had earlier been described by the brand simply as “leather flat sandals,” according to , sparked fierce and ongoing debate over cultural appropriation. Critics accused the label of erasing the legacy of Indian artisans, with voices across social media calling out what they saw as blatant design theft. Within a week, Prada had acknowledged in a letter to an Indian trade group that the sandals in its men’s Spring-Summer 2026 collection were indeed “inspired by traditional Indian footwear.” In a statement to CNN, the brand said it has “always celebrated craftsmanship, heritage and design.” Prada later added that it had met artisanal footwear manufacturers in India “to discuss potential opportunities for future collaboration.” Prada’s readiness to confront the controversy could be a reflection of the fashion industry’s growing interest in India’s luxury consumers — and a reluctance to anger them. But the episode also epitomizes how Western labels have often struggled to meaningfully engage with the country’s crafts and culture. India’s luxury market is on a dramatic ascent, estimated to expand from $7.73 billion in 2023 to by 2028 — a rate that would likely outpace most of the world’s major luxury markets, according to global consulting firm Kearney. This projected growth is fueled by a rising middle class, increased urbanization and a new generation of brand-conscious, internationally minded young consumers. But today’s Indian luxury consumer is “no longer a singular archetype,” according to the celebrated Indian fashion designer Gaurav Gupta. “We’re seeing a beautifully diverse audience, from second-gen industrialist families to first-gen digital entrepreneurs, artists and global citizens — who are all looking for something deeper than just a logo,” he said in an email. Major brands have been investing heavily in response. Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga and Valentino are among the fashion houses that have opened flagship stores in Mumbai or Delhi in the last three years. Others have collaborated with Indian labels or creatives on designs intended to speak more authentically to local audiences. Some of these brands are “adapting beautifully,” Gupta said, but the “real disconnect happens when brands view India as a commercial opportunity rather than a cultural dialogue,” he added. “The Indian buyer wants to feel seen. It’s no longer enough to just open a flagship in Mumbai, you need to speak the emotional and visual language of the market.” Indian inspiration is as essential to Western fashion as pajamas and Madras plaid. But accusations of cultural appropriation have intensified in recent years due to the growth of internet access in the country, the rise of social media platforms and a surging sense of cultural pride. “A lot of Indian people, including designers and artisans, are aware of their rights,” said Toolika Gupta (no relation), director at the Indian Institute of Crafts and Design (IICD) in Jaipur, in an email, adding: “They want acknowledgement of their legacy.” In 2019, fashion house Gucci sparked controversy with its “Indy Full Turban,” sold for $790 on Nordstrom’s website. The blue headpiece closely resembled the traditional Sikh turban, prompting in India and elsewhere. It was eventually removed from the website, with Nordstrom quickly apologizing amid the backlash. Just this year, the clothing company Reformation was criticized for a blouse, skirt and scarf that reminded many South Asians of the lehenga, an Indian garment consisting of a long skirt, top and a dupatta (scarf), a staple of Indian fashion for centuries and typically draped across a woman’s chest. Some took issue with Reformation’s lack of acknowledgement for the garment. One TikTok user joked: “My girl is about to go strut the streets of India… Give credit where credit is due, this is literally a lehenga with a dupatta.” She also noted that the pastel-colored blouse, skirt and scarf were strikingly similar to lehengas worn by Bollywood celebrities in the early 2000s. In a statement to , Reformation said the design in question was inspired by a 1990s-era John Galliano gown and scarf set owned by the model Devon Lee Carlson, with whom it collaborated on the collection. just my thoughts on these pieces from the ref x devon collab H&M, meanwhile, recently came under fire for a sleeveless sheer “long camisole” top and trouser that many social media users likened to the salwar kameez, a traditional Indian tunic and pant. In a statement to CNN, H&M said the design took “inspiration from current fashion trends like dresses layered over pants and the popularity of sheer pieces, as well as various plays on transparency and movement.” It’s not just labels that have sparked controversy. Frustration spilled onto TikTok last year after the fashion rental company Bipty posted a now-deleted video featuring White women wearing sheer shawls draped across their chests, describing the look as “very European effortlessly chic.” South Asian users on the platform immediately noted the similarities between the shawl and a dupatta. Many posted their own videos draping dupattas and mockingly dubbing them “Scandinavian scarves,” using humor and irony to highlight the apparent erasure and misrepresentation of Indian heritage. Bipty did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. “With Instagram receipts and Gen Z rage, the tolerance for bad takes is zero,” the anonymous commentator behind the popular Instagram account Diet Sabya wrote in an email to CNN. (Diet Sabya, which draws inspiration from the established social account Diet Prada, often highlights fashion industry missteps, including cultural appropriation.) “What once went unnoticed or unchallenged is now getting called out in real-time,” the email added. “Someone in Delhi has the same access to discourse as someone in London. So, when a show uses a sacred motif incorrectly, the backlash is fast, loud and fully deserved.” High fashion’s relationship with Indian artisans stretches back to at least the 17th century, when Europe’s royal tailors sought out textiles like cotton and silk from the subcontinent. Over centuries, this cross-continental exchange has transformed Indian motifs from prized curiosities into ubiquitous elements of Western style. According to IICD’s Gupta, textiles such as chintz and paisley are deeply rooted in India’s rich artistic traditions and have long inspired global fashion, though their origins are now frequently overlooked. But India is not just a source of inspiration for luxury fashion — it’s also an integral part of its supply chains. Today, a significant segment of the industry’s manufacturing is outsourced to ateliers, embroiderers and textile producers in India. Yet, despite Indian artisans’ foundational role, their creations are often shipped to Europe for final assembly and can thus be labeled as being “made” in Europe. This kind of erasure, according to Imran Amed, founder, CEO and editor-in-chief of the industry publication The Business of Fashion, has “reduced India to a manufacturing hub while Europe gets the cultural and economic credit.” “In India, where craft is livelihood for millions, this distinction matters even more. It’s not just about symbolism — it’s about economic justice and dignity,” he said via email. The backlash Prada faced “wasn’t just about a sandal,” Amed added. “It was a broader reaction to a long history of erasure and under-acknowledgment.” Homegrown designers are helping to change things. Indian fashion is having a striking impact on red carpets worldwide — and not only on the backs of Bollywood stars. Western celebrities are increasingly embracing Indian designers, too. Cardi B wore a custom-made, electric blue, hooded sculptural gown by Gaurav Gupta to the 2023 Grammys, while Zendaya walked the carpet in a shimmering, hand-embroidered blue sari gown by Rahul Mishra at a high-profile event in Mumbai months earlier. Kim Kardashian, meanwhile, has worn designs by the likes of Manish Malhotra and Sabyasachi Mukherjee, who last year became the first Indian fashion designer to attend the exclusive Met Gala in New York. “It’s a powerful shift, almost like we’re reclaiming our own narrative,” Gaurav Gupta told CNN. “Designers from India are now presenting on the global stage not as ‘ethnic’ alternatives, but as innovators with our own language, our own shapes, our own ideologies. We’re not adapting to fit in anymore; we’re expressing to stand out.” For many Indians, the Kolhapuri chappals that Prada said it was “inspired” by represent the ingenuity and artistry of Kolhapur, a historic city nestled in the country’s western Maharashtra state. Typically crafted from locally sourced buffalo hide and tanned using traditional vegetable dyes, the sandals could effectively withstand the relentless heat and rugged terrain of the Deccan Plateau. The distinctive toe loop, which is attached to the T-strap, helped keep them close to the wearers’ feet. Cutting across generational and social divides, the Kolhapuri chappal embodies both the enduring spirit of rural India and a bridge to contemporary fashion. The shoe is protected by a coveted “geographical indication” tag — like the one ensuring Champagne is only produced in France’s Champagne region — that, in theory, safeguards this symbol of Indian heritage from copycats. “It’s something truly Indian,” said Shubhika Sharma, the prominent Indian fashion designer and founder of the label Papa Don’t Preach, in a video interview. Prada’s initial failure to acknowledge the Indian artisans behind the design amounted to a “missed opportunity for Indian craftsmanship,” Sharma added. About 10,000 artisan families in Kolhapur are engaged in the chappal trade, according to local media reports, though many of them struggle in poor conditions and earn low wages. In India, Kolhapuri chappals can retail for as little as $5 or as much as $100, depending on the quality of leather and level of craftsmanship. While Prada’s sandals had not hit the market at the time of last month’s controversy, the luxury fashion house’s shoes typically retail at prices ranging from $700 to well over $2,000. For Sharma, “everything just boils down to respect,” she said. “Was due respect given to the creator, to the person who originated it, to the culture that originated it?” Some Western labels have proven better at engaging with Indian audiences than others. In 2023, Dior made headlines by hosting a at Mumbai’s historic Gateway of India, unveiling a Pre-Fall collection that celebrated the subcontinent’s artistry. The collection featured Banarasi brocade, mirror work, tie-dye detailing, Nehru collars and kurta tailoring — motifs deeply rooted in Indian tradition and craftsmanship. Many of the embroideries and textiles on the runway were made by the Mumbai atelier Chanakya International, which was credited for its role. The show was widely hailed as a respectful homage, with Vogue India’s fashion director Anaita Shroff Adajania describing it as “a thank you to India.” Amed, from The Business of Fashion, meanwhile, called the collaboration between Chanakya International and Maria Grazia Chiuri, then Dior’s creative director, as “thoughtful… not performative,” adding: “Chiuri hasn’t just sourced embroidery from India; she’s spotlighted the artisans, acknowledged the lineage of the craft, and in doing so, helped shift perceptions of where luxury value is created.” Similarly, last month, Nike launched its first collaboration with an Indian fashion label, the Delhi-based brand NorBlack NorWhite, unveiling a vibrant range of sportswear inspired by ancient tie-dye techniques. The move was broadly celebrated by social media users in India, a country in which Nike has long struggled to make commercial inroads. For Diet Sabya’s founder, however, much more must be done to ensure genuine recognition for Indian talent and traditions. “When India is being eyed as the next big luxury market, you can’t keep treating it like an exotic pitstop,” they said. “While a few brands are finally acknowledging us as the global textile powerhouse we are — it’s still crumbs. Visibility is a start. But equity is the end goal.”", "tags": ["costly", "cultural", "—", "fashion", "india", "missteps", "beckons", "western", "brands"]},
{"content": "India’s southern state of Kerala has found a unique ambassador to promote its coconut palm-lined beaches, backwaters and vibrant culture to tourists - a British F-35 fighter jet that has been stranded there since mid-June. The Royal Navy aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at the airport of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram on June 14 and has been grounded ever since, despite efforts to repair it. An AI-generated image of the stealth aircraft parked on the tarmac surrounded by coconut trees has gone viral after it was shared by Kerala’s tourism department on Wednesday. “This was part of our tourism campaign. It has been one of the most innovative and eye-catching ones… It’s all in good humour and creativity,” Biju K., Kerala’s tourism secretary, told Reuters. In the viral social media post, originally created by entertainment website The Fauxy, the jet can be seen giving the state of Kerala five golden stars, calling it “an amazing place”. “I don’t want to leave. Definitely recommend,” the image quotes the jet as saying. “Though tourism is under the government, it has moved out of government space in promoting the destination,” said Roy Mathew, director of Stark Communications, the tourism department’s brand promotion agency. Kerala is among India’s most popular tourist destinations, and markets itself with the tagline ‘God’s own country’. Last year, 22.2 million tourists visited the state. It boasts natural beauty along India’s south-western coastline and a rich heritage of classical dances, temple festivals and vibrant cuisine. The Indian Air Force said last month it would help in the repair and return of the F-35, which made an emergency landing on June 14 when it was flying over the Arabian Sea off Kerala’s coast. A British High Commission spokesperson told Reuters the UK had accepted an offer to move the aircraft to the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility at the airport. The jet will be moved to the hangar once engineering teams arrive from the UK with specialist equipment, the spokesperson added. The Royal Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

{"content": "They are the two and neighbors clamoring for more tourists, but for much of the last five years it has been difficult for and nationals to vacation in each other’s nations. Now that looks set to finally change as previous fractious relations between the two Asian giants finally begin to thaw. India will issue tourist visas for Chinese citizens for the first time in five years, allowing nationals from its neighboring country to freely visit each other, marking a significant reset in relations after a deadly border clash sent ties into a deep freeze. From Thursday, July 24, Chinese citizens can apply for tourist visas to India, the Indian embassy in Beijing said Wednesday. This “positive news” is in the “common interests of all parties,” China’s foreign spokesperson Guo Jiakun said. “China is willing to maintain communication and consultation with India to continuously improve the level of facilitation of personnel exchanges between the two countries.” There has been a gradual normalization of ties between India and China in recent months after relations were deeply strained in June 2020, when a brutal hand-to-hand battle in the Galwan Valley left at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead. Both nations maintain a heavy military presence along their 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC) – a boundary that remains undefined and has been a persistent source of friction since their bloody 1962 war. The 2020 clash in the disputed region between Indian Ladakh and Chinese-controlled Aksai Chin marked the first deadly confrontation along India and China’s disputed border in more than 40 years. Tensions escalated in the aftermath. India banned multiple Chinese apps, heightened scrutiny of Chinese investments and direct air routes between the two neighbors were canceled. Both countries had shut their borders to foreign tourists due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but visa restrictions continued even as global travel began to resume. China lifted tourist visa restrictions for Indian nationals in March after Beijing and New Delhi announced they would work to resume direct air travel, according to Reuters. Now India’s reciprocal move is seen as a welcome move by many. “Inbound tourism is going through tough period post Covid, so it is good for us that another market has opened,” according to Sarvjeet Sankrit, founder of the Delhi-based travel agency Ghum India Ghum (Roam India Roam), who said he saw “lots of Chinese tourists” visit the capital before the visa ban. India lifting restrictions is “a good thing for vehicle owners, guides, and hotel owners,” he said. “Everyone will get more business.” Chinese national Kate Hu, whose boyfriend is from India, said she is excited at the prospect of finally being able to visit his family. The Hong Kong-based comedian had already booked tickets to visit India for his sister’s wedding in April when she found out she couldn’t get the visa. “I lost a bit of money there,” Hu said. “We had talked about getting married just to have the visa, so now I’m happy to hear I won’t have to get married just for a visa,” she joked. Her boyfriend is currently in India to take care of his sick mother. “If this (news) had come out sooner, then I could have gone with him,” she said. Pradeep K, a consultant in Delhi called India’s latest move is “a good thing,” adding “people of India and China will get to interact more.” He said he is excited at the prospect of traveling to China to see pandas. “Will a diplomatic move on paper change mindsets and bring people closer? Your guess is as good as mine.” India’s decision to remove visa restrictions is the latest in a string of steps taken by New Delhi and Beijing to reset ties after Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia last October. In January, India and China agreed to resume direct commercial flights and Beijing recently agreed to reopen Mount Kailash and Lash Manasarovar in western Tibet to Indian pilgrims for the first time in five years. Earlier this month, India’s foreign minister S. Jaishankar met with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing, where the two “took note of the recent progress made by the two sides to stabilize and rebuild ties, with priority on people-centric engagements,” according to a statement from the Indian foreign ministry. There has been a “gradual normalization of the India-China relationship,” said Harsh V. Pant, foreign policy head at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank. “There is a certain recalibration happening from both ends. But this is also a reflection that India faces a unique challenge in managing China,” he added. Despite the ongoing tensions, India is still economically dependent on China and sees “a possibility of building an economic partnership” while making its red lines clear, Pant said. Delhi-based teacher Saurabhi Singh said while India and China have fought wars in the past, “relations can and should change.” She added: “We have labor, markets, manufacturing abilities and a fondness for food, tea, electronics that connect people of both countries.”", "tags": ["hail", "end", "tensions", "populous", "visa", "travelers", "world", "chinese", "indian", "nations", "diplomatic"]},
{"content": "As I stepped off the bus in Tokyo’s wealthy Mejiro neighborhood and onto its quiet streets, the familiarity hit me hard and fast. Though the rows of traditional Japanese homes were now dotted with a scattering of modern houses — some with luxury cars parked in the driveway — there was no mistaking it: my father’s childhood home. Originally built by my great-grandparents in the 1930s, the plaque bearing my family name was still at the entrance next to the steps my dad used to help me climb as a child during our visits from Michigan. But we never stayed long — my father was always restless, always ready to move. It was a stark contrast to our life in the US, where my dad raised my sister and me. He was always present and never missed a chance to attend one of our school events. He was a man of few words, but always knew how to make people laugh. He loved taking care of others, never hesitating to pay for dinners or baseball games. But now, standing before my father’s childhood home as an adult, I saw more than memories in its frame — I saw the foreshadows of the moment that changed my family’s life forever. Though it happened 25 years ago, I still remember his death vividly — pain leaves a far more stubborn mark than joy. When I was 12 years old, my father hanged himself in our suburban house outside of Detroit. We had just gotten into a fight over his spending habits, and I told him I hated him. As a child, I failed to see how complicated he really was. Beneath the generosity that earned him so many friends in his adopted home was an obsession with money and success. Eventually, he turned to gambling, always wanting more. I thought speaking up would help him. I thought he would listen to me because I was his daughter. He was rushed to the hospital and put on a ventilator, but it was too late. For more than 20 years, I carried the weight of his death in silence, obsessing over ways to say “I’m sorry,” while wondering if something was broken in me for not being able to let it go. The first few years after his suicide I had terrible nightmares, images so realistic they pulled my sweat-drenched body upright in the middle of the night. I believed his death was my fault and didn’t understand how to process what I was feeling. It took about five years before I could cry about it, with therapy never a consideration as I thought it meant I was weak.  I left home before I finished high school.  Everything reminded me of him and how I failed him. What saved me was his love for the camera. Growing up, my dad was constantly taking videos and photos of my sister and me. Big events — and the quiet moments in between — were carefully preserved in a photo album or a VHS tape, each one marked with a retro date stamp and title card. These included an album filled with photos of him as an infant in Japan in the 1960s, another one from his childhood living in Turkey in the 1970s, and a scattering of photos from a trip to India in the 1980s. One day it hit me: I had a travel itinerary. I decided I would leave the comfort of my job in Hong Kong as a producer at CNN, a world so distant it felt untouched by my father’s shadow, and follow the path of his life. Armed with my camera — lightyears ahead of the one my dad used — and his photo albums, I was ready to hit the road. First stop: Japan, where my father was born. My mother, Kyoko Maruyama, once told me my father never liked staying in his parents’ house when he visited. Even when business trips brought him to Tokyo, he booked a hotel. Seeing it in front of me that hot July day in 2024 immediately stirred memories of visiting as a child, but provided little comfort. The house, sold over a decade earlier, showed signs of neglect. My heart sank as I viewed the peeling paint and spiderwebs. The family grave was also discarded, its headstone gone, weeds covering the plot. The city government had apparently removed it, unable to find a successor to take care of it. It was as though my father’s history had been erased, and I was too late to save it.  All I had now were the photos. Thanks to those images, I was able to identify the university he attended in Japan and locate a few of his friends. They were shocked to learn of his death and agreed to meet me at a yakitori place in central Tokyo — just as they did during their college days.  As we dined on chicken skewers coated in sweet and savory teriyaki sauce and drank cold beer, his friends shed light on my dad’s adventurous youth. He was the leader of their college’s international club, they said, and, being the sole English speaker, took on the responsibility of guiding his classmates through India. They also confirmed my suspicions: my father, the eldest son in a wealthy family, felt immense pressure to carve his own path to success. “His favorite movie was ‘East of Eden’ with James Dean,” Masako Kuramochi, a college friend who traveled with him to India, told me, referring to the cinematic classic about a son’s deepest desire to please his father, based on the John Steinbeck novel. “He loved James Dean so much he tried to act and dress like him!” Hearing these stories meant the world to me. With no family left in Japan, my dad’s friends were the only people who could offer any insights into his photos. It helped me prepare for my next stop: Turkey. Most visitors to Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city, head straight for its world-famous sites, like the or the Roman-era Hippodrome. My first stop, however, was the Istanbul Technical University library — one of Istanbul’s most prestigious engineering schools. I had already found some info online. My grandfather, Shohei Maruyama, had been an engineer employed by Japan’s largest electric company, and was involved with the construction of a large dam in Turkey. I knew from my own family that my father attended international school in Ankara, but little else. At the library, I found a book in Turkish that said my grandfather was in charge of a large 1970s hydro project near Samsun, on the coast of the Black Sea. Photos of my dad, grandfather and his Turkish colleagues in Samsun offered more clues, and after making a few enquiries I was connected with a former intern, Erdogan Ozoral, who shared some images and stories, including one about a man who had known my grandfather, but died just a few months before I arrived in Turkey. “He said your grandfather was a good man,” Ozoral told me. Accompanied by the former intern, I drove from Samsun, now a city of about 740,000 people, to a remote area an hour away. Crowded streets of commercial buildings faded into the countryside, the occasional house punctuating the landscape. Eventually, we reached a long road winding up a mountain, with a large river on our left and a green forest on our right. “This is it,” my companion said as we stopped in front of a large dam. Word had spread about my visit, and soon we were joined by about a dozen locals who dissected my photographs and excitedly walked around trying to identify the exact spots they were taken. Before I knew it, I was wearing a hard hat and an orange neon vest and being taken underground “Your grandfather helped create the first dam with this underground mechanism,” said the former intern, smiling. “You should be proud.” When I was in Japan, I felt as if my family’s legacy had been erased. Unexpectedly, I had found it thousands of miles away. Yet it also made me reflect on a moment I have long struggled with — seeing my grandfather, who took an emergency flight from Tokyo, sitting next to my dad as he lay unconscious in his hospital bed on that terrible day back in Michigan. My mom wanted my grandparents to be part of the decision on whether to take him off life support. I could only see the back of my grandfather, but he looked so small that day. My dad spent his life chasing his own father’s approval. I wondered if, in the end, my grandfather ever questioned it all. With this weighing on my mind, I headed back to Istanbul to plan for the next leg of my journey. Suddenly, while walking through the city’s European side, a movie poster of “East of Eden” caught my eye, propped up against a wall outside an antique shop. I looked at James Dean and smiled. The India portion of my trip was the most challenging to plan, mainly because I didn’t have many photos to reference. My father’s college friends came to the rescue again. One gave me his own photo album featuring highlights from their India trip. The first page featured a hand-drawn map highlighting their destinations — including New Delhi, the Taj Mahal and the Ganges River — and whether they planned to travel to each by plane or train. Landing in India’s capital weeks later, the chaotic streets were both overwhelming and exciting. I took a tuktuk to Old Delhi’s famed Khari Baoli spice market, where the aroma of Masala-filled pastries and freshly grilled street food filled the air. Vendors loudly showed off their treasures to passing shoppers. Colorful shops were crammed with clothing, tools and spices. I tried to imagine how my father would have reacted to these sights and sounds and recalled a conversation I’d had with his friends back in Japan. “No one took your father seriously,” said Masuko Kuramochi. “Yeah! That’s why when he said he was going to meet Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, we didn’t believe him! But he did!” added Kimio Settai, another friend. As wild as that sounded to me — a random meeting with a world leader — another buddy, Naoki Hosono, who was with my dad that day, confirmed the encounter. Naoki was kind enough to join me virtually for a video chat during my own visit to Indira Gandhi’s former house — now a popular museum dedicated to her memory — and explained how it happened. “Your dad woke me up and said, ‘We’re going to meet Gandhi!’” he laughed. “Next thing I knew, we were outside her house, and he was talking to the guards.” Somehow, my father convinced them to escort the pair inside, to a courtyard. “Right there!” Naoki shouted at me through the phone screen as I made my way across the outdoor space. “We were just a few feet from her.” My dad’s nerves apparently got the best of him. Naoki said he froze, but the prime minister initiated a conversation, and my dad answered her breathlessly. Unable to speak English, Naoki couldn’t recall what they talked about. He said my dad was perhaps a bit too excited, so much so that he stumbled into a minor collision with a tuktuk when they exited. As I finished making my rounds through the museum, Naoki paused. “You look a lot like your father,” he said, emotion hanging in his voice. “He was a great friend.” Following the map, my next stop was Agra, where I visited the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort, both of which featured in my father’s images. It was a surreal feeling, standing in the exact spot his photos were taken, the scenery unchanged from the 1980s. I touched the marble of the Taj Mahal that my dad had leaned against decades prior. It felt like he was with me the entire time. It was the holy city of Varanasi, in India’s north, that really offered me a sense of healing. My mother told me that when my parents were in college, my dad had said he wanted his remains scattered in the Ganges River. And it was there that I felt, for the first time, what he had experienced when he’d stood in the very same place. It was about 11 p.m. when I arrived at Varanasi’s Burning Ghats, where I watched families say goodbye to their loved ones as bodies burned on funeral pyres in front of me, the quiet sounds of crackling wood filling the air. When a man approached, asking where I was from, we talked about the scene in front of us and what it all meant. “How can someone truly let go of their loved ones?” I asked him. The man, whom I later learned was a beggar, explained that according to Hindu beliefs, the spirit moves on to a new life and we, the living, must accept it and also move on. “We need to see what is in front of us, those that are living around us,” he said. It was the message I needed to hear as I readied myself for the part of the journey I was dreading most — going home to the US. It was my dad’s ambition that brought him to Michigan in the early 1990s. After he finished university, his goal was to work for the largest American company in the auto industry — and the Motor City was where his dream came true. When he got hired at Ford Motor Company, I saw a rare glimpse of pride in his eyes. He even called his father to share the news — a moment that felt almost like triumph. Coming back to the quiet Michigan suburbs of Rochester Hills in October 2024, I felt like a weight had settled back on my shoulders. Though it had been decades since I left, the memories sang like I’d been here yesterday. My childhood home was still there. Kids rode bikes through the street with their parents. There were no new buildings, just different people living in those same homes. I had a very American life there when my dad was alive, and it was a good one. He was friends with all the neighbors; people knocked on our door almost every weekend, wanting to hang out with him. After he died, word quickly spread, and the neighbors stepped up to help. If it snowed, someone was there to plow the driveway. When fall came, someone was there to rake the leaves. When lightning hit a tree in our yard and blocked our driveway, three neighbors showed up with a chainsaw to clear the way. I wouldn’t be where I am today without this community. And I think my dad liked his American life, too. He participated in every school event, every neighborhood parade, and celebrated all of the traditional American holidays and activities, even heading out each December to cut down a tree for Christmas. He got into home renovations and fixed up our basement. Home Depot became his favorite spot — a far cry from his life as a college kid in Tokyo. While back in Michigan, I visited the farm my dad would take me pumpkin picking for Halloween and grabbed one of the giant gourds, just like in a photograph taken when I was seven. I felt my dad watching over me with a smile. I still had one more place to go: Indiana, where he lived for a few years during university after transferring from Tokyo before moving to Michigan. Accompanied by a friend, I drove south to the town of Fairmount, the childhood home of James Dean, where a sign bearing a classic image of the actor welcomes those arriving by road. I held in my hand a photo of my dad visiting James Dean’s grave in Fairmount, a sketch he made of the actor when he was a high school student, and another photo of him with James Dean’s cousin, Marcus Winslow. Winslow never left the house he grew up in with Dean, so he wasn’t hard to find. Neither was the grave, which is now a tourist attraction. We knocked on Winslow’s door and there he was, the same face from the 1980s, just a little older. I showed him a picture of him with my dad. He didn’t remember much about the visit, but we had a lot more in common than I thought. Winslow lost Dean when he was 12 years old. I lost my dad at the same age. Through our short chat, he reminded me it’s OK to miss your loved ones, whether it’s been 23 years or 70. It was a message that echoed what strangers from around the world taught me during my travels — love for a lost loved one crosses all borders. As my trip neared an end, there was just one more person to see in Indiana: the man who knew my dad like no one else, his best friend Mohammad Beitvashahi, who he met after transferring from university in Tokyo. The drive was familiar. The annual road trips my dad took us on to see Mohammad and his family were a ritual we looked forward to. I remember watching my dad and Mohammad get into brotherly wrestling matches — their strange way of saying “I missed you.” Twenty-five years ago, when Mohammad heard what happened to my dad, he dropped everything and drove eight hours from Indiana to the hospital in Michigan, sleeping on the waiting room floor beside me. He just couldn’t bring himself to step into my dad’s room. Mohammad eventually took some of us home to take a break from the bedside vigil. When my mom called from the hospital to break the terrible news, he was the one who answered. “Your dad’s gone, Mayumi,” he told me after hanging up the phone. “There’s nothing we can do now — I’ll be here in the morning.” This news made me nervous. I immediately began dreading the moment everyone who came to take care of us would go home — I didn’t want to be alone. But Mohammad was there the next morning and for decades after, sometimes sneaking cash into my car whenever I came for a visit, making sure I was okay.  No matter what country or state I was in, he was only a phone call away. Sitting in front of him in the present as we looked through his old videos and photos, I realized I was never alone. “I miss your dad, he was the only person I could talk to,” said Mohammad as one videotape, taken during a New Year’s party, rolled. Seeing my father laugh on the TV reminded me how lucky I am to have him watching over me, his best friend by my side, to share these memories. Each chapter of my dad’s life held quiet struggles, some that may have led to his decision to take his own life. I’ll never fully understand why he left, or if I can ever truly forgive him. I still feel angry about what he did, but I have come to realize it’s because I loved what I had in the life he created for me — and I can’t understand why he had to leave it so soon. But by walking his path, I came to know him — and myself. His final years were filled with the images he took of my sister and me. With my own camera, I turned the lens back on him — across countries, continents and time. He passed on not a legacy to uphold, but a way of seeing shaped by love. In every frame, he reminded me that being my father was his greatest role. For that, I thank the camera. And I thank my dad for showing me the way — again. I am proud to be the daughter of Shuhei Maruyama.", "tags": ["answers", "albums", "world", "journey", "life", "dad"]},

The boy, who authorities estimated was about 13 years old, was found wandering around the tarmac near where the plane had parked shortly after it had landed on Sunday morning, according to a statement from India’s Central Industrial Security Force. When they questioned him, authorities found he was from Kunduz in northern Afghanistan and that he had traveled by hiding in the “rear central landing gear” of a KAM Airlines aircraft, the statement added. They also found a small red audio speaker in the area the boy was hiding. He was repatriated back to Afghanistan later that day. The distance between Kabul and Delhi is about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) and the flight took about an hour and a half. Hiding in a plane’s wheel well is the most common method used by stowaways in their sought-after journeys, even though it is incredibly dangerous. More than 77% of people who have attempted to hitch an illegal ride on an aircraft have died, the Federal Aviation Administration said in 2019. Stowaways often get crushed when the landing gear retracts, as there’s not much room; in many aircraft, the space is even smaller than the trunk of a car. As the flight reaches higher altitudes, conditions get worse. Oxygen levels become extremely low and stowaways can often struggle to stay conscious. During the flight, temperatures outside an airplane can drop dramatically, with stowaways risking frostbite and even hypothermia.

{"content": "Jet fighters flew over a packed stadium in southern Pakistan, streaking the sky with the green and white of the national flag and garlanding a sporting spectacle the country has been waiting to host for a generation. The two teams strutted out into the National Stadium in Karachi to a huge roar from the crowd, getting underway the Champions Trophy tournament that cricket-obsessed Pakistan hopes will cement its rehabilitation into the cricketing world. Long roiled by and terror attacks – including a deadly attack on a visiting Sri Lanka cricket team in 2009 – Pakistan has for years been off the roster for international tournaments. Now world cricket powerhouses like Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand and South Africa are here for around three weeks of cricket, and fans are ecstatic. Authorities in Karachi were taking no chances during the opening match between Pakistan and New Zealand on Wednesday. Snipers were in position on rooftops along routes to the stadium. Commandos and SWAT teams manned checkpoints around the sprawling port city. Farah Qadri spent hours under the blazing sun passing through security checkpoints outside the stadium, but said the “surreal” experience of seeing the opening game of the tournament was worth the wait. There were people from “all walks of life huddled together, cheering, chanting and dancing nonstop,” she told CNN. The Champions Trophy “is a huge positive for the entire country,” said Basit Ali, 36, who watched the opening match from a teashop in Peshawar near the Afghan border. “I pray that Pakistan successfully defends its title and brings joy to the nation.” Cricket is almost a second religion in Pakistan, with superstars plastered on billboards, and the national team the objects of intense pride – or anger – depending on results. But the last time Pakistan hosted an international tournament was in 1996. That’s meant an entire generation in the nation of around 220 million has come of age without experiencing the thrill of playing host to the world’s best. Excitement mingled with nervousness for Farees Shah, a cricket podcast host who also joined the throng of fans in the Karachi stadium on Wednesday. It’s like “you’re the biggest party animal out there but after ages you’re hosting the party, so you just want to make sure everything goes smoothly,” he told CNN. Events off the cricket pitch rarely go smoothly in Pakistan. Former prime minister – and World Cup-winning cricketer – Imran Khan is currently in jail for corruption and revealing official secrets – charges he says are a plot by rivals to keep him from returning to office. The country’s and reliant on IMF bailouts, while the powerful military is entrenched in every aspect of life, according to its critics. A long-running Taliban insurgency has killed tens of thousands, while authorities are also battling a festering and bloody separatist movement in the resource-rich southwest. Cricket has been caught up in the violence too. In 2009 Sri Lanka’s cricket team was attacked by militants on their way to a match in the northeastern city of Lahore. The gunmen sprayed the team bus with bullets as it neared the stadium, killing eight people – six policemen and two civilians – and leaving several of the visiting players wounded, sending shock waves across the cricket world. Pakistan was subsequently stripped of hosting rights for the 2009 Champions Trophy. A later militant attack caused the country to be ruled out of co-hosting the 2011 World Cup. Hosting the Champions Trophy is a “milestone moment” for Pakistan, the chairman of Pakistan’s Cricket Board (PCB) Mohsin Naqvi told CNN in a statement. The tournament is an “opportunity to reaffirm Pakistan’s status as one of the most passionate and influential cricketing nations, fully capable of staging multi-nation tournaments at the highest level,” he said. Authorities say they are pulling out all stops. The national airline is putting on special flights to ferry the visiting teams around the country to their matches. Every player and match official has been given “state guest status” according to authorities – the equivalent of being treated like a visiting head of state. There is one hiccup, however. India, the top-ranked cricket team in the world – and Pakistan’s fiercest rival – isn’t coming to the party. Cricketing officials there have cited “security reasons” for refusing to come to Pakistan. India will play its matches instead in the United Arab Emirates. That decision has dampened the mood of fans globally and enraged Pakistani ones, denying the hosts the chance to face off against their neighbor and biggest rival on home turf. Since independence from Britain in 1947, nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought three wars and introduced heavy restrictions on exchanges of goods and people, despite their closely entwined shared history and culture – and love of cricket. India-Pakistan matches are in the world and attract mega sponsors and hyper fanfare. Around are estimated to have tuned in to watch Pakistan beat India in the final of the last Champions Trophy in 2017. Viewing figures for the were paltry in comparison, at around 127 million. Naqvi, chairman of the PCB, called India’s absence “a loss for spectators, broadcasters, media, and the tournament itself.” “But it is also a missed opportunity for Indian players to experience the warmth, love, and hospitality that Pakistan has always extended to visiting teams.” CNN has contacted India’s cricket board for comment. For cricket fan Basit Ali in Peshawar, Sunday’s upcoming clash with India will be the highlight of the tournament, even if it does take place in Dubai. “The real excitement will be when Pakistan faces India. I can’t wait for that!” Farees Shah, the podcast host, told CNN he wanted “nothing more than Pakistan cricket to do well.” “It is equally important to me that the tournament goes effortlessly.”", "tags": ["play", "international", "come", "safe", "party", "cricket", "country", "teams", "full", "years"]},

This whole journey starting from qualifying to the (qualifying tournament) Candidates, then coming here, it could only be possible by God. There were so many miracles. “And I’m thankful for all the people who have been by my side on this journey. I would like to thank each and every one of them, but probably I will have to prepare my speech first because (with) the kind of emotions I’m feeling right now I’ll say something stupid.” India has become a major chess powerhouse with a storming onto the scene.

Last year, he and his sister, 22-year-old Rameshbabu Vaishali (R Vaishali), became the first-ever brother and sister duo to obtain grandmaster titles. Congratulations and declarations of pride poured in from across India following Gukesh’s win. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Gukesh, : “Historic and exemplary!

This is the result of his unparalleled talent, hard work and unwavering determination. “His triumph has not only etched his name in the annals of chess history but has also inspired millions of young minds to dream big and pursue excellence. My best wishes for his future endeavours.” Draupadi Murmu, India’s president, said Gukesh’s win “stamps the authority of India as a chess powerhouse.” Sports figures also lavished the new grandmaster with praise. Anand commended his compatriot for bringing the world title back to India. “Congratulations! It’s a proud moment for chess, a proud moment for India, a proud moment for WACA, and for me, a very personal moment of pride,” Anand . “Ding played a very exciting match and showed the champion he is.” Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar said Gukesh had “opened a world of endless possibilities.” “Following in Vishy’s footsteps, you’re now guiding the next wave of Indian chess prodigies,” he wrote on X.

{"content": "The competition was tight until the very last shot. Abhinav Bindra was level with his closest rival going into the final round of the men’s 10-meter air rifle at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Then, with a near-perfect shot, Bindra won India’s first-ever individual Olympic gold. It was a historic achievement that many in India hoped could prove a turning point for the giant country following many decades of underperformance at the Olympics. But 16 years, four Summer Games and just one additional gold medal later, those dreams have largely failed to materialize. India, home to more than 1.4 billion people, is the world’s most populous country, according to the . In 2022, India surpassed Britain as the world’s fifth largest economy, and last year became one of just four countries to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon. And it’s led by an ambitious prime minister who has widespread influence on the global stage. But when it comes to the Olympics, India punches below its weight. India won just six medals in Paris, falling short of its record haul of seven at Tokyo in 2021. The United States, with less than a quarter of India’s population, topped the charts with 126 medals followed by China with 91. India ranked 71st in the medal table, below nations with much smaller populations including Georgia, Kazakhstan and North Korea. India has now won just , all at the Summer Games. “There is no doubt that India has been an underperformer in the Olympics and generally in global sports,” said Ronojoy Sen, author of “Nation at Play: A History of Sport in India.” “If you look at the population to medal ratio it is probably the worst.” Among the bright spots for India in Paris, added silver to the gold he won at Tokyo 2020, and shooter Manu Bhaker clinched double bronze to become the first Indian woman to win two medals at the same Games. , known for her high-profile role in anti-sexual harassment protests, became the first Indian woman to qualify for a wrestling final in the women’s 50kg freestyle – only to be disqualified for failing to make her weight class. On Wednesday, her appeal for a silver medal was rejected by the . CNN reached out to the Indian Olympic Association for comment on the team’s performance in Paris. India’s history of untapped Olympic potential can be explained by several factors, according to experts, with underinvestment in sports being a major culprit. New Delhi has never poured resources into a national training program like those of traditional Olympic powerhouses, which have long regarded gold medals as a symbol of national strength, Sen said. “For nations like the USA, China and the (then) Soviet Union, sport was very much a part of their nascent national story, it was a means for global recognition and glory,” he said. The most successful Olympic nations also identify and develop talent from a young age, he added, pointing to China, where “you see kids being trained right from the moment they can walk.” Indian athletes often face obstacles such as inadequate funding and a lack of access to facilities, analysts say. “When people say 1.4 billion people and only (six) medals, that is a totally wrong headline, because … 1.39 billion people don’t have access to sports facilities,” said Boria Majumdar, sports analyst and author of “Dreams of a Billion: India and the Olympic Games.” India sends far fewer athletes and support staff to the Olympics than top teams like the US, Majumdar said. For example, 117 Indian competitors went to Paris, compared with nearly 600 Americans. India also faces broader health challenges that impede development and curtail sporting potential from childhood, experts say. India ranked 111th of 125 countries in the report. At 18.7%, it has the world’s highest child wasting rate – the number of children who are too thin for their height – reflecting acute undernutrition. More than one third of children under age 5 in India are stunted due to malnutrition, meaning they are too short for their age, according to the report. “Until we address some of these basic concerns around nutrition, it will be very hard for us to achieve greater excellence at the highest level of sport where victories are counted in milliseconds,” Sen said. Another challenge to Olympic progress is the additional barriers faced by women athletes in India, in what remains a deeply patriarchal nation. “Right from childhood, when I started wrestling, people would tease me saying that ‘she’s a girl what can she do, why is she entering a male sport?’” said Sakshi Malik, an Indian wrestler who won bronze at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Malik quit wrestling last year amid controversy over sexual harassment allegations against India’s wrestling chief, which saw Malik, Phogat and other wrestlers sleeping on the streets of Delhi for weeks demanding action. “I gave up my sport which I love beyond all else for this fight because I bear that responsibility of protecting the younger athletes who come after me,” Malik said. “Things have to change.” While India’s overall showing in Paris may not have wowed, fans celebrated the feats of the country’s medalists in social media in an outpouring of pride and admiration. Individual athletes have the power to galvanize a population, Majumdar said. “To think that the entire country is watching javelin at 2 a.m. because of one man, that is a revolution,” he said, referring to the millions watching back home as India’s Chopra won silver in Paris. India’s massive Olympic potential is perhaps best underlined by its status in cricket, by far the country’s most popular sport and one in which it has become the dominant global force. Cricket has not been included in the Olympics since 1900 but is set to return at Los Angeles 2028, to the excitement of Indian fans and players, who will be chasing gold. While cricket’s multi-billion-dollar Indian Premier League is the most visible sign of sports investment in the country, other sports have also received a boost in recent years - both from increased corporate sponsorship and government funding. In 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched “Khelo India” or “Let’s Play India,” a nationwide program to “revive the sports culture” in the country with the aim of identifying and funding promising young talent, particularly in rural areas. That same year, India also revamped its Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), which supports and funds training, international competition, equipment and coaching for elite athletes. As of July 2024, India’s sports ministry had allocated nearly $260 million to state governments to develop sport infrastructure under the Khelo India program. Sen, the author, said there is also a growing realization in India of the soft power potential of global sporting success, citing Modi taking the time to call Olympic medalists to congratulate them. “I appreciate the efforts of the Indian contingent through the games,” Modi wrote on Monday. “All the athletes have given their best and every Indian is proud of them.” During the International Olympic Committee’s annual meeting in Mumbai last year, Modi told sports officials that India would bid to host the 2036 Summer Games, . The IOC said it also expects to soon add an Indian sponsor to its roster of 15 top-tier partners, which together gave the Games almost $740 million last year – another sign of India’s growing Olympic ambitions. Majumdar, the sports analyst, believes India’s best Olympic days are yet to come. “I think the journey has started but it’s not going to happen overnight,” he said, pointing out that India spends just a fracture of US expenditure on sports infrastructure. “In another decade I believe India has the potential to be in the top half of medals.”", "tags": ["golds", "punches", "populous", "weight", "country", "world"]},

The 15 cargoes of oil, each typically ranging from 700,000 to 1 million barrels, will be loaded from Russia’s Arctic and Black Sea ports – supplies that usually go to India instead of China, given its distance, Xu said. Reuters reported earlier this week that China had secured 15 Russian cargoes for the same period, citing analysts. Xu said the buying reflected an “opportunistic” move, with the price of Russian oil remaining at least $3 per barrel cheaper than Middle Eastern alternatives. “As for whether China will continue buying, I personally believe that right now is still a very good opportunity, because over in India, Trump is still pressing hard on them,” she said. On Friday, following his , Trump told Fox News that he was not immediately considering retaliatory tariffs on China over its purchase of Russian oil, but suggested he may do so “in two weeks or three weeks.” “Taking advantage of this opportunity while prices are low, I think more refineries will probably consider buying more, within a week or two,” Xu said, referring to Chinese refiners. Last year, India imported $53 billion worth of petroleum and crude oils from Russia, according to . Before the recent cuts, Russian supplies accounted for 36% of Indian market, making the country its largest source of crude, according to Vortexa, an energy data firm. China has also increased imports of discounted Russian oil since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia provides 13.5% of China’s crude imports, according to Vortexa. Last year, China imported $62.6 billion worth of Russian petroleum and crude, the UN data shows. Xu said China is unlikely to make up for the shortfall in India’s purchases of Russian oil, as India buys around 1.7 million barrels per day from Russia, while China purchases only about 1.2 million barrels of seaborne Russian oil per day. “If India keeps holding off on buying, that’s going to be a real problem for Russia – China just can’t take on all of India’s volume by itself,” she said.

{"content": "US President Donald Trump is ratcheting up the pressure on India, calling into question the prospects of a deal with a key US trading partner just days before his tariff deadline. In Wednesday, Trump sharply attacked India’s trade barriers and directly targeted its sustained reliance on Russian oil purchases and military equipment. He doubled down on his on all Indian imports and threatened an additional “penalty” in response to India’s energy purchases. “Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!” In a sign the president was losing patience with the country, he in the early hours of Thursday, saying, “I don’t care what India does with Russia,” while reiterating New Delhi’s tariffs are too high. “They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” he said. Trump’s tariff escalation comes on the heels of a series of deals with major US trading partners that have set a rough baseline for tariffs of between 15% and 20%, and included a series of pledges to expand market access for US products and foreign investment commitments. He also announced a trade framework in place with Pakistan, India’s neighbor and archrival, although details were thin. Trump said the agreement, if completed, would include developing Pakistan’s oil reserves with a yet-to-be-named oil company. “Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!” he wrote in a . For India, the new threat marks a major setback in a monthslong effort to secure a deal that officials believed on several occasions was nearing the finish line. In a statement on Thursday, India’s commerce ministry said it has taken note of Trump’s statement and is studying its implications. New Delhi remains committed to reaching a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement, it said. Top trade officials have been transiting back and forth between Washington and New Delhi for months in pursuit of a final agreement. But the recent trade agreements with Japan and the European Union have emboldened Trump in the final days before the August 1 deadline for the administration’s paused “reciprocal” tariffs to snap back into place, officials say. Trump’s ability to secure commitments on market access for US producers has become a particularly salient fixation as he has reviewed draft offers in recent days, the officials said. That has created a significant obstacle to the prospects of an agreement with India, one official told CNN. “They’re willing to go part of the way,” the official said. “But the president isn’t in a ‘part of the way’ mood – he wants barriers removed completely or as close to completely as possible.” Trump’s approach is tied in part to a strategy that has become increasingly apparent to foreign trade officials involved in late-stage talks: Trump has no qualms about letting those higher tariffs go into place – a message he’s delivered repeatedly in public over the last several weeks. But it’s also created an environment in which Trump has embraced a clear sense of leverage over trading partners – even close allies – who are desperate to maintain access to the world’s largest consumer market. “I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we’ve made with India but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that’s good for the American people,” Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett said at the White House on Wednesday. The tariffs on India, Hassett said, might cause them to “reconsider their practices.” “Over time, I would guess that Indian firms will be onshoring production in the US, and Indians might even open their markets more to us so that we reconsider our future trades,” Hassett added. For Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official who runs the Global Trade Research Initiative, a Delhi-based think tank, even if India is faced with a 25% tariff plus penalty, the South Asian country is “not significantly worse off” than countries that did sign deals with the US, which have given sweeping concessions. “India did not walk away from the deal; it negotiated in good faith but refused to cross its red lines,” he said, adding that Trump’s justification for the tariffs doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. “For now, India’s principled stand has avoided the trap of a one-sided deal – and that’s a success,” Srivastava said. At the same time, Trump has escalated in parallel his threat to impose secondary sanctions on Russian energy exports in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s refusal to de-escalate attacks on Ukraine. That dynamic, which has long been weighed across successive administrations, would directly impact India and China most as nations who purchase the bulk of Russian energy products. India’s oil imports from Russia have ticked up this year as Russia continued to be the top supplier to the world’s most populous nation. Russia for roughly 35% of India’s overall supplies, followed by Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. CNN has reached out to the White House for more information on what the penalty will be and if India will be receiving an official letter from the United States marking the tariff, as other nations have received. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that India would pay 25% tariffs if they don’t reach a deal by August 1. When imposing a 50-day deadline on Russia to reach a ceasefire earlier this month, Trump announced that countries that purchase Russian oil would face secondary sanctions. That ceasefire deadline has since moved to August 8. Trump officials have been privately making clear to counterparts that Trump’s threat to significantly escalate an already sweeping US sanctions regime on Russia should be taken seriously and is not a negotiating ploy, the officials said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday he shared that message directly with his Chinese counterparts during trade talks in Stockholm. “I think anyone who buys sanctioned Russian oil should be ready for this,” Bessent told reporters at a news conference at the conclusion of the talks. According to an analysis of Russian fossil fuel exports and sanctions conducted by the Air in June, India continued to be the second-largest buyer of Russian fossil fuels behind China.

{"content": "President Donald Trump said on Monday that he will “substantially” raise tariffs on because it’s still buying Russian oil. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,” the president posted on his social media network, Truth Social. “Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA.” But India pushed back, saying it is being unfairly targeted by the United States and European Union for importing oil from Russia. Tariffs are taxes directly paid by importers, though countries exporting goods could indirectly get harmed, as higher prices tend to drive demand down, leading countries to buy more from other countries with lower tariffs or to increase domestic production. Last week, Trump threatened a minimum 25% tariff on goods coming from India, set to take effect at the end of this week. Indian goods are currently subject to a 10% minimum rate. Trump did not specify what new goods from India could be charged if it continues to purchase Russian oil. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs said the country began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the start of Russia’s war on Ukraine. “India’s imports are meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to the Indian consumer. They are a necessity compelled by (the) global market situation,” a statement posted on social media from the ministry’s spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal read. India said both the US and the EU were also “indulging in trade with Russia.” “In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” the statement said. The Kremlin has also denounced the US plan to raise tariffs on Indian imports. “We hear many statements that are in fact threats, attempts to force countries to stop their trade relations with Russia,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday. “We do not consider such statements legal. We believe that sovereign countries should have – and do have – the right to choose their own trading partners.” Trump’s tariff threat comes as he’s upped the pressure on Russia’s Vladimir Putin to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine within days, shortening his prior deadline.", "tags": ["oil", "trump", "russian", "tariffs", "indian", "goods"]},
{"content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook should be breathing a sigh of relief. The White House on Wednesday ratcheted tariffs on Indian imports up by an additional 25%, raising the total levies on one of the United States’ most crucial trading partners to 50% when they kick in later this month. But smartphones are exempt from President Donald Trump’s new levies on India, marking a crucial win for the tech giant as it approaches its most important time of the year: its annual September iPhone launch followed by the holiday season. Apple will also dodge incoming new tariffs on semiconductors, since it’s committed to building iPhone components in the United States, Trump said Wednesday. That’s not to say tariffs won’t hurt; CEO Tim Cook said tariffs will likely cost the company this quarter. But analysts say Apple has bigger concerns, such as its future product strategy and approach to artificial intelligence, a burgeoning field that the tech behemoth is perceived to be behind in. Under different circumstances, such high tariffs could have spelled trouble for Apple. The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, making up the majority of its revenue. Most iPhones sold in America . And the Americas, which includes the United States, is Apple’s largest market. “In terms of the longer-term issues, more than a year out, I would say tariffs are probably 20% of it,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, who has covered Apple for decades. “I think what’s going on the regulatory environments (is) probably 25%, and 55 is related to how they’re going to capitalize on AI.” Tariffs are a challenge for Apple, but one that analysts seem confident the company can manage.  A combination of Apple’s diversified supply chain – which it partially shifted to areas like India and Vietnam around five years ago to reduce reliance on China during COVID – along with its high margins and Cook’s operations expertise put the company in a strong position. Supply chain resilience is “supposed to allow you to adjust tactically to any major changes that comes unexpected,” said Runar Bjørhovde, a research analyst for market research firm Canalys. That held true even before Apple committed to investing an additional $100 billion in the United States to manufacture iPhone parts domestically on Wednesday. While moves like these don’t directly impact tariff policy, they do likely help Apple curry favor with the administration, especially as Trump has pressed Apple to build its iPhones domestically. “Look, he’s not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world, not even close,” Trump said. “He’s coming back. I mean, Apple is coming back to America.” Some analysts already expected that the iPhone would be exempt from the upcoming levies on India ahead of Wednesday’s tariff announcement. But the back-and-forth tariff policies, which have changed multiple times throughout the year, make it challenging to predict what could happen in the future. “Because (smartphones are) such an important category, the relationship that Apple has with both administrations, and specifically, even the US administration, we do think that they will be able to maneuver against this threat,” said Nabila Popal, senior director with the International Data Corporation’s data and analytics team. “But it is important, of course. It does present a risk.” That said, analysts largely believe India and China are Apple’s only two options for producing US-bound iPhones at scale. And since iPhone models available in the United States don’t precisely match those sold elsewhere, Apple can’t just redirect iPhones intended for different markets. New iPhones sold in America, for example, don’t have physical SIM card slots anymore, and they support millimeter wave 5G, the kind of connection that provides faster, low-latency speeds but usually only at a short distance. “It’s a massive tactical nightmare to deal with,” said Bjørhovde. “Because you have to try and find a sweet spot and figure out what comes next.” Cook said iPhones will continue to be assembled outside of the United States for “a while” during an event at the Oval Office announcing the new $100 billion investment on Wednesday. But he pointed to the company’s strategy of instead producing iPhone components stateside. “Well, if you look at the bulk of it, we’re doing a lot of the semiconductors here, we’re doing the glass here, we’re doing the Face ID module here, and so there’s a ton of it, and we’re doing these for products sold elsewhere in the world,” Cook said. “And so there’s a lot of content in there from United States.” The narrative that Apple is behind in AI has been looming over the company all year – and some analysts see it as a more challenging issue to overcome than tariffs. Apple delayed a high-profile upgrade to its Siri assistant that would have enabled it to provide more personalized answers and act across apps, bringing it up to speed with the agent-like capabilities that Google and OpenAI are pursuing with their digital helpers. And the company’s rivals are still using that setback as ammunition to promote their own products over Apple’s. Just this week, Google for its upcoming Pixel 10 phone that said: “If you buy a new phone because of a feature that’s coming soon, but it’s been coming soon for a full year, you could change your definition of soon.” Apple’s initial batch of AI features also didn’t launch in time for the iPhone 16’s arrival last September. At the same time, many of Apple’s peers are seeing booming returns from their AI investments. ( ) and ( ) both hit $4 trillion in market capitalization in July, a milestone Wall Street previously thought Apple ( ) might reach first. That’s partially because of their fundamentally different products and business models. Apple is a consumer hardware company. In contrast, Microsoft, Meta ( ) and Nvidia also provide the tools that businesses rely on to support AI-powered services and features, like cloud computing, chips and AI models. Still, Apple saw for the June quarter, surpassing expectations for iPhone sales – including in China – and overall revenue. But during Apple’s earnings call, analysts pressed Cook about his perspective on AI and what it means for the company’s products. Those questions ranged from whether AI services might be eating into search engine usage, whether the forthcoming Siri upgrade could drive future new products and whether Apple would consider acquiring AI companies to further its product roadmap. “Taking a step back, we see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime,” Cook said in his opening remarks during the earnings call. “We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments.” But Apple can’t risk falling too far behind when it comes to the iPhone’s AI capabilities. By doing so, it could create an opportunity for Samsung, Google and Qualcomm – the three of which dominate the Android phone space – to pull ahead, says Ted Mortonson, managing director and technology sector strategist at financial services company Baird. “What’s more important with investors is, after the iPhone 17, what do they really do?” he said. “I mean, as far as generative AI and AI functionality, that that’s the real focus on Apple right now.”", "tags": ["war", "trump", "tariff", "bigger", "concerns", "big", "apple", "win"]},
{"content": "President Donald Trump’s relentless use of tariffs to coerce foreign counterparts into favorable deals is about to run headlong into the limits of geopolitical reality. Trump’s willingness to the long-running US economic warfare in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine is real, advisors say. His threat to is certain to come to fruition, they insist. But he also faces the backdrop of a to extend a trade truce with the world’s second-largest economy that as White House deliberations come to a head. “He’s pissed,” one person close to Trump said of his rapidly deteriorating view of Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent weeks. “But he’s also aware of the competing priorities here.” Trump faces a unique challenge balancing all of his simultaneous demands: He is threatening punishing sanctions on the Russian energy production that serves as the financial linchpin of Putin’s war machine at the same moment he is seeking leverage in trade talks with India while maintaining a fragile trade détente with China. The convergence of conflicting priorities have driven intensive discussions inside the West Wing about the range and scope of the options Trump could trigger as soon as today – and put a significant amount of weight on the , his trusted foreign envoy, underway in Moscow. Trump has threatened sweeping secondary sanctions on Russian energy that would primarily hit China and India, the two largest purchasers of Russian energy. But he’s also considering more tailored options, including sanctions that target specific tankers – known inside the government as the “shadow fleet” – that are utilized to skirt the existing Western sanctions regime in the transport of Russian oil, two US officials with the knowledge of the matter said. The Biden administration’s evolving sanctions actions found success in blacklisting the vessels critical to Putin’s sanctions evasion efforts. Secondary sanctions tailored specifically to India in some form have also been discussed, the officials said. Trump feels empowered to trigger the those secondary sanctions that were long weighed by his predecessor, but never deployed due to soaring inflation and concerns about a significant increase in domestic gas prices. That is a problem Trump simply doesn’t have right now, as waning global demand and a steady increase in output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies have mitigated the concern about the energy price spikes that bedeviled the Biden administration. For the Trump administration, that has created leverage as frustration with Putin’s refusal to come to the table has dashed Trump’s envisioned quick end to the three-plus year conflict. Those dynamics also played directly into the recent breakdown in long running and intense trade negotiations between the US and India, advisors say. While there is obvious overlap between Trump’s escalating threats targeting Russia and his explicit warnings about India’s energy purchases, the dispute with the world’s fifth-largest economy is specific to the trade talks, the officials say. “We consider a wide range of options, but this is a situation more of convenient coincidence than overarching strategic long-game,” one of the officials said. Trump has acknowledged as much. “The sticking point with India is that tariffs are too high,” Trump said in an interview Tuesday with CNBC. Peter Navarro, Trump’s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, has called India as “the Maharaja of tariffs,” underscoring a long-running view that India’s expansive protection of its domestic markets has been a significant frustration for Trump and his trade team. As the clock ticked toward Trump’s August 1 “reciprocal” tariff deadline and foreign partners offered significant concessions on US market access, India was a notable exception, officials said. “The president wanted deals that substantially opened markets – everything or near everything,” a senior administration official said. “The were interested in opening some of their markets, but not nearly ambitious enough to meet the president’s view of what would constitute a good deal.” So while India’s purchases of Russian energy and Russian military equipment was well known on the periphery, Trump elevated those friction points to the forefront as he sought to pressure Indian negotiators, the official said. Any large-scale effort to trigger secondary sanctions, however, would crash directly into the delicate maintenance of US-China trade talks which have seen both countries utilize economic statecraft, sanctions and export controls to exert or ease pressure on the bilateral relationship over the course of months. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned his Chinese counterparts directly, during the third round of face-to-face talks last week, that Trump was serious about secondary sanctions and it was something Chinese officials needed to prepare for in the weeks ahead. But as US and Chinese officials have quietly continued discussions over the technical details of an agreement to extend their existing trade truce, the concern about the impact secondary sanctions would have on those dynamics has been a factor inside the administration, officials say. Trump has yet to officially sign off on an extension, even as his top advisors made clear it was only a matter of time before Trump blesses it. For Trump, who has operated throughout his second term in a perpetual state of running deadlines, that clock is ticking concurrently with his .

{"content": "US President Donald Trump followed through with doubling to 50% on Wednesday, to punish the country for importing Russian oil and helping Russia finance its . But the United States and Europe themselves are still doing billions of dollars in trade with Russia – although that’s a fraction of the trade that took place before the war. India has argued that it’s being unfairly targeted with the tariff increase, calling it “unjustified” given that other nations also do business with Moscow. Earlier this month, New Delhi signaled it would retaliate against the so-called “secondary tariffs.” Trade between Russia and the US has fallen by about 90% since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but last year, the US still imported $3 billion worth of goods from Russia, according to the from the (BEA) and Census Bureau. Meanwhile, the European Union – which has been the Americans’ partner in sanctions against Russia – imported $41.9 billion (36 billion euros) of goods from Russia in 2024, data from the bloc’s statistics agency shows. “It’s significant, but I think the more significant thing is how quickly the EU adjusted to reduce their dependency on Russia,” said Kimberly Donovan, director of the Economic Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a DC-based think tank. “They’re making huge strides to further reduce how much they’re getting from (Russia).” EU imports from Russia dropped by 86% between the first quarters of 2022 and 2025, according to Eurostat data. “I do think that there is a lot of opportunity for the US and even the EU to increase our trade with countries like Canada and get the products that we need from them,” Donovan added. “That’s where the trade wars and the negotiations over tariffs are really throwing things for a loop and are reducing our ability to be strategic in how we’re approaching the Russia problem.” These are the areas where economic ties with Russia remain the strongest, for the US and Europe respectively. • The US imported $927 million worth of fertilizer in the first half of this year, US Census Bureau data shows. Last year, fertilizer imports from Russia totaled more than $1 billion. The US particularly relies on Russia for imports of three types of chemical fertilizers: urea, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) and potassium chloride muriate of potash, also called potash. “Unless the US sanctions Russian fertilizer imports, as it does with Belarusian potash, this (level of trade) is likely to continue,” said Allan Pickett, head of fertilizer analysis at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “Russia remains one of the most important global fertilizer suppliers and the influence of it has not diminished since 2022.” “Urea and potash could be readily sourced from elsewhere, although with potash it would further increase US dependence on Canada, which currently has an interesting trade dynamic,” Pickett added. The Trump administration recently to a minimum of 35% –unless goods are compliant with the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement – escalating with its northern neighbor. • Although palladium imports from Russia have reduced significantly since 2021, data shows that the US still imported $878 million worth of the metal in 2024 and $594 million worth in 2025, through June. The silvery metal is used in various electronic and industrial products and it’s a key component in the catalytic converters of cars. • The US has imported $755 million worth of uranium and plutonium from Russia so far this year, according to Census data through June. It imported $624 million worth of those commodities from Russia in 2024. • Russia was the largest supplier of petroleum to the European Union prior to Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The EU has since imposed a ban on maritime Russian oil imports, as well as refined oil products, like diesel. As a result, oil imports to Europe fell to $1.72 billion (1.48 billion euros) for the first quarter of 2025, down from $16.4 billion (14.06 billion euros) in the same quarter of 2021, according to the most recent data from . The top European importers of Russian fossil fuels in July 2025 were Hungary, France, Slovakia, Belgium and Spain, according to an analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, an international research organization. Hungary and Slovakia accounted for the vast majority of crude oil imports, according to the , while the others import mostly liquefied natural gas. • The value of natural gas imports from Russia actually increased in the last four years as a result of price increases, growing to $5.23 billion (4.49 billion euros) in the first quarter of 2025, . However, the EU has slightly reduced Russia’s market share of liquefied natural gas imports since 2021 – from 22% down to 19% in 2025 – while also greatly increasing the US market share. • Russia’s share of iron and steel imports in the EU has dropped sharply. Iron and steel imports amounted to $850 million (730 million euros) in the first quarter of 2025 – about half of what they were in the same quarter in 2021, according to Eurostat. • Sanctions and import duties have not hit the fertilizer industry, and as a result, European imports of Russian fertilizer have changed very little since 2021. In the first quarter of 2025, EU countries imported $640 million (550 million euros) of Russian fertilizer, data shows. • The EU has diversified imports to rely more on nickel from the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom and Canada. Still, the bloc imported $300 million (260 million euros) worth of nickel from Russia in the first quarter of 2025. Nickel is primarily used to make stainless steel and other alloy steels, as well as batteries. Beyond imports and exports of commodities, many Western companies remain entrenched in Russia. Some notable American-based holdouts continue to operate in Russia, including top 100 companies, according to and . Dozens of European businesses, including consumer-facing brands, retailers and software companies, have also remained in Russia. The amount of tax revenue that Western companies generate for the Kremlin is relatively small, but analysts say the companies that remain have allowed aspects of normal life to continue for the Russian population. Corporate exits serve to bring the war closer to the Russian people and confront their “complacency,” as well as make it more difficult for Putin to paint a picture of a well-functioning economy, said Yale School of Management’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, whose large team of researchers keeps track of which companies have left. “It’s an imploding market – it was never an economic superpower to start with – which is just a lot of smoke and mirrors, a lot of bravado on the part of Putin to try to create an aura of something bigger,” Sonnenfeld told CNN. In contrast to the reduction in trade with Moscow seen in the United States and EU, India imported $67 billion worth of goods from Russia in 2024, according to . Roughly $53 billion worth of that was petroleum oils and crude oil. Before the full-scale war, in 2021, India imported $8.7 billion worth of goods from Russia. India’s imports of Russian oil and gas have skyrocketed since the war began. Russian oil now makes up 36% of the Indian market, according to Vortexa, an energy data firm, meaning it imports more crude oil from Russia than from anywhere else. China has also ramped up purchases of Russian crude oil following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Its price fell after Western countries sharply scaled back their imports of Russian fuel. Russia now accounts for 13.5% of China’s crude imports, according to Vortexa.

{"content": "The leaders of three of the world’s largest countries will be gathering for a Eurasian summit in China this weekend. But when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping join other heads of state in Tianjin for the 25th summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), absent will be American sparring partner President Donald Trump. “For this particular summit, the US may not be at the table, but the US is always present,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center. Trump will nonetheless be the talk of Tianjin. “The one thing that they’re going to talk about is the United States, its policies, its tariffs,” predicted Sushant Singh, lecturer in South Asian Studies at Yale University. Case in point, Prime Minister Modi. He will arrive in Tianjin days after the Trump Administration imposed a stinging 50% tariff on Indian goods, among the highest of Trump’s current tariffs. The White House presents this partly as a penalty for India’s purchase of Russian oil. Trump’s unexpectedly tough approach to India ( much to New Delhi’s chagrin), reverses decades of US cultivation of the South Asian giant as a democratic counterweight to China “It’s a massive shift. It’s a U-turn,” said Yale University’s Singh. Analysts say the tariffs broadside from Trump has pushed Modi into making some concessions towards China and cautiously embrace Xi at a time when the two giant neighbors had already been exploring . “Mr. Modi had no option but to go and cut a deal with President Xi,” said Singh, speaking on the phone from New Delhi. This will mark the Indian leader’s first visit to China since 2018. Relations between the two Asian giants cratered in 2020, after Chinese and Indian soldiers bludgeoned each other to death in the first of a series of violent clashes in a disputed Himalayan border region. But after a freeze that lasted years, both countries recently started re-issuing tourist visas for each other’s citizens and have said they would resume direct flights cancelled during the Covid-19 pandemic. For years, India’s foreign minister stated that relations between the two countries would never be normalized until tension on the disputed border was resolved. Modi’s mere presence in Tianjin will mark something of a strategic recalibration and a demonstration of India’s new geopolitical vulnerability. Less than three weeks after Trump rolled out the red carpet for Putin at a US airbase in Alaska, the Russian president will be arriving for a visit to China at a time when Moscow’s missiles . He will not only participate in the Tianjin summit but also attend a massive military parade in Beijing alongside Xi and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un on September 3, setting the stage for a stark show of unity between the three powers. Trump’s on-again, off-again overtures to the Russian strongman are unlikely to impact the so-called “no limits” partnership between Russia and China. That relationship has only deepened in recent years, as cross-border trade has hit new heights. Meanwhile, both countries continue to engage in security cooperation, most recently with the announcement that they conducted their Analysts say the glue that binds these once-hostile neighbors ever closer is their shared perception of the US as a threat. “There’s a famous saying in the Chinese policy community,” says Sun from the Stimson Center. “China and Russia can share miseries but not happiness.” China, faced with a slumping domestic economy, is also grappling with its own long and painful trade war with the US. Meanwhile, Russia, with its much smaller economy and the international isolation triggered by its invasion of Ukraine, desperately needs a hand from China, turning Moscow into the junior partner in this relationship. Beijing’s top diplomat reportedly told European officials It would be a “major devastation for the Chinese security architecture if Russia were to fall or become Westernized,” said Claus Soong, an analyst who specializes in China-Russian relations at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. In 2022, just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin and Xi to call for “shaping a polycentric world order.” Their governments have chafed for years at the global dominance the US has enjoyed since the collapse of the Soviet Union. President Trump’s chaotic foreign policy, which has included attacks on longtime allies and the almost-overnight dismantling of global free trade, presents China, the world’s second largest economy, with fresh opportunity. As world leaders gather for the SCO summit in Tianjin and the subsequent World War II victory military parade in Beijing, expect Xi to promote China as a stable alternative to Washington. “China is definitely using this opportunity to demonstrate to China’s neighbors that China is a benevolent leader, a benevolent hegemon…dependable, predictable,” said the Stimson Center’s Sun. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has deep structural flaws, including the between several of its member states and dialogue partners (India and Pakistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan). But this Eurasian gathering may present a more appealing alternative to nations worried by the US and its increasingly unpredictable position on the world stage.", "tags": ["long", "china", "leaders", "casts", "global"]},
{"content": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping made a veiled swipe at the United States on Monday as he criticized “bullying practices” and cast his country as a new leader of world governance, at a time when President Donald Trump’s America First foreign policy is upending the globe. “The house rules of a few countries should not be imposed on others,” Xi told more than 20 world leaders gathering at a two-day summit orchestrated to play-up China’s global leadership and its close and enduring partnership with Russia, as the two neighbors seek to rebalance global power in their favor at the expense of the US and its allies. The meeting of the Beijing- and Moscow- backed Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in the northern port city of Tianjin is China’s biggest diplomatic event of the year, drawing political heavyweights including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. At the summit, Xi pledged 2 billion yuan ($280 million) in grants to SCO member states this year, and an additional 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in loans to an SCO banking consortium over the next three years. “We should leverage the strength of our mega-sized markets and economic complementarity between member states and improve trade and investment facilitation,” the Chinese leader told his guests during opening remarks. Later in the day, Xi unveiled a brand new Global Governance Initiative, a sequel to his three earlier “initiatives” on security, development and civilization that together serve as a loose outline for his vision of a reshaped international order. “I look forward to working with all countries for a more just and equitable global governance system,” Xi said, pledging to increase the representation and voice of developing countries and practice multilateralism – echoing longstanding calls from the Global South. “We should continue to dismantle walls, not erect them; seek integration, not decoupling,” he added. Xi’s vision pushes back against what Beijing sees as the foundations of a US-led world order, opposing alliances like NATO – which in his view exist to enforce the West’s rules-based system – and calling into question the concept of universal human rights, while seeking to reshape power at the United Nations and other bodies it sees as unfairly dominated by the West. Without naming the United States directly, Xi vowed to oppose “hegemonism,” “Cold War mentality” and “bullying practices” – phrases often deployed by Beijing to criticize Washington. As Trump alarms nations with his global trade war, withdrawals from international organizations, slashing of foreign aid and threats on social media, Beijing views the US as undermining the international order it worked to build – and sees an opportunity to ramp its own vision as an alternative. “We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar of the world, and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization and make the global governance system more just and equitable,” Xi said in his opening remarks. Echoing Xi’s remarks, Putin said the SCO laid the groundwork for a “new system” of security in Eurasia, positioning it as an alternative to Western-led alliances that he has long railed against. The new system “would replace the outdated Eurocentric and Euro-Atlantic models, take into account the interests of the broadest possible range of countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow attempts by some states to ensure their security at the expense of others,” Putin said. The summit is a showcase for closer ties between China and Russia, as well as the friendship struck up over the years by their two autocratic leaders. The deep personal rapport between the two men was on show Sunday evening, when Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan hosted a welcome banquet for attending leaders. Footage released by Russian state news agency RIA showed Xi and Putin gesturing animatedly and smiling as they chatted at the event, showing a different side of the typically restrained Chinese leader – and his warm and relaxed demeanor with his Russian counterpart. The SCO summit is also the leaders’ first opportunity to meet since Putin’s summit with Trump in Alaska in August – and comes as Putin resists Western pressure to end his onslaught in Ukraine. Just last week, Moscow’s forces carried out their second largest aerial attack to date on Ukraine. On Monday, Putin used his speech at the SCO summit to reiterate his talking points on the war in Ukraine, saying the crisis “did not arise as a result of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, but rather as a consequence of a coup d’état in Ukraine, which was supported and provoked by the West.” Moscow launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after Russia’s troops previously seized the Crimea and swathes of eastern Ukraine. The Russian leader praised efforts by China and India at facilitating the resolution of the crisis, and described the “understanding” reached with Trump at the Alaska meeting as “opening the way to peace in Ukraine.” “During the bilateral meetings scheduled for today and tomorrow, I will, of course, inform my colleagues in more detail and thoroughly about the results of the negotiations in Alaska,” Putin said, adding that he had already informed Xi “in detail” during a lunch on Sunday. Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov told Russian state media that Putin discussed Ukraine with world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, including Xi and Modi. Ushakov downplayed the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, which was teased by Trump after he met the two leaders last month. “Everyone is talking about a trilateral meeting, (or) about a meeting between Putin and Zelensky … But, as far as I know, there was no specific agreement between Putin and Trump about this,” Ushakov told Russian state media journalist Pavel Zarubin on Monday. Observers said the Russian leader would have used the gathering to show that he’s not alone on the global stage. “(Putin) will seek to frame Russia’s resilience and China’s backing as evidence that Western sanctions and isolation have not worked,” Li Mingjiang, an associate professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said ahead of the gathering. “At the same time, he will try to deepen strategic alignment with Beijing, in particular to ensure Chinese supply of dual-use goods and equipment to Russia (and) to show that Moscow has strong partners even as Washington ramps up its push to end the war.” China has emerged as a key pillar of diplomatic and economic support for Putin’s regime since the early days of the Ukraine invasion, even as it claims neutrality in the conflict. Chinese firms have bought up swaths of discounted Russian oil and provided it with critical trade, including dual use goods that Western leaders say have powered Russia’s defense industrial base. Beijing defends its “normal trade” with Russia. Trump earlier this summer threatened to take aim at that partnership, saying China could face major tariffs on its goods if it continued to purchase fuel from Russia as it wages war. But even as the US imposed such penalties on India last week, it has so far slow-rolled that threat as it seeks a broader trade agreement with Beijing. White House senior counselor for trade Peter Navarro said Monday that the show of unity between Russia, China and India is “troublesome.” “It’s time for the Modi to step up. I have great respect Modi. I love the Indian people,” Navarro told reporters at the White House on Monday. “It was a shame to see Modi getting in bed, as the leader of the biggest democracy in the world, with the two biggest authoritarian dictators in the world, in Putin and Xi Jinping. That doesn’t make any sense.” Trump’s whopping 50% tariff on India has soured ties with Modi – and accelerated a nascent and cautious rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing. The Indian leader met with Xi on Sunday in his first trip to China in seven years, as both countries face stiff US tariffs and Western scrutiny over their relationships with Russia. On Monday, Modi highlighted his ties with both his host and the Russian leader at the SCO summit, embracing Putin before the two walked over hand in hand to greet Xi. The three leaders then shared a conversation marked by smiles and laughter. Modi and Putin also held a nearly hour-long private meeting in the Russian presidential limousine, the Aurus, while en route to their formal talks, according to Russian state media. “India and Russia have always stood shoulder to shoulder even in the most difficult times,” Modi said at the start of the meeting. “We have been in constant dialogue on the situation in Ukraine. We welcome all the recent efforts for peace.” A from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said the two leaders discussed the latest developments concerning Ukraine. “(Modi) reiterated his support for the recent initiatives that have been taken to address the conflict in Ukraine, and emphasized the need to expedite a cessation of the conflict, and find a durable peace settlement,” the ministry said. Observers say that Xi sees the gathering – and a massive military parade that he’ll host on Wednesday in Beijing, expected to be attended by Putin, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as well as some two dozen other leaders – as a critically timed diplomatic push. Chinese officials touted this year’s SCO as the largest yet, saying ahead of the event that 20 leaders from across Asia and the Middle East would join. In addition to Russia, China and India, SCO members include Iran, Pakistan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.

{"content": "President Donald Trump is mad that China is palling around with his strongmen friends. Trump erupted on social media late Tuesday night — US time — as television footage aired of Chinese leader Xi Jinping hosting the authoritarian leaders of Russia and North Korea at a stunning . “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,” in a message to Xi. The Truth Social post heard around the world means one thing: If China’s two big gatherings of authoritarian leaders, US adversaries and erstwhile allies this week was intended as a personal affront to the US president, it worked perfectly. And it underscored the futility of his attempts to subject the true global hard men to his art-of-the-deal charms and his claims that his supposedly close relationships with such leaders can be decisive. Trump met with Putin in Alaska last month, but his has so far failed to unlock any progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. Putin has defied Trump’s hopes by escalating attacks on civilians and is stalling on . The US president’s first-term summits with Kim were similarly unsuccessful. The North Korean leader has more nuclear weapons now than he did before taking part in Trump’s photo-op diplomacy. The president’s online tirade went on to point out that Americans had suffered heavy losses in the struggle against a common enemy, imperial Japan, the 80th anniversary of whose defeat was marked in Beijing on Wednesday. “Many Americans died in China’s quest for Victory and Glory. I hope that they are rightfully Honored and Remembered for their Bravery and Sacrifice!” Trump wrote. comes at a tense international moment as the new Asian superpower seeks to capitalize on Trump’s erratic foreign policy, which has shattered America’s reputation as a reliable great power. Trump’s fury was ironic, since the last few days in China have seen the kind of performative spectacle that he loves. But the gathering of anti-Western powers in Tianjin and Beijing is about more than trolling. It’s an early warning that Trump’s second-term policies based on tariff coercion, the bullying of lesser powers and “America First” nationalism may be backfiring. “China is leveraging the missteps or mistakes that the US (is making),” Jackie S.H. Wong, an assistant professor of international studies at the American University of Sharjah, told CNN’s Becky Anderson on “Connect the World” Tuesday. Some of the alarmist talk about China and Russia building a new axis of resistance to the US is overblown. Nations represented at a in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin lack formal defense agreements or pooled economic sovereignty to compare to groups like NATO or the European Union. Territorial tensions periodically spark between China and India. Moscow might need China’s help in fighting its war in Ukraine, but the Kremlin is still getting used to being the junior superpower. And despite Communist Party iron rule, China suffers from internal political and economic pressures, demonstrated by Xi’s regular purges of top officials and military brass. But the festivities of recent days are part of China’s wider effort to showcase its emerging might and to test out alternative global affiliations and systems as it seeks to eclipse the West. By gathering leaders from Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere, it was demonstrating the capacity of a bloc to frustrate US global power on multiple fronts. One top US military leader on Tuesday downplayed the significance of events in China. “Nations like China and North Korea and Russia, and others do these kind of events. There’s certainly a big focus on messaging,” Gen. Kevin Schneider, commander of the US Pacific Air Forces, “But I think the takeaway for this is we are not deterred,” Schneider said. A lot of this predates Trump. Eight decades after the end of World War II, it’s not surprising that institutions born in the aftermath of the horror need a reboot. The rise of populous developing nations was always going to threaten American hegemony and the global system built and dominated by the West. And as the last members of the Greatest Generation fade away, the triumph of the democracies in World War II is becoming history rather than a tangible human memory. But Trump’s choices in the first eight months of his second term are accelerating a shift of global power to the East. They’re playing into Xi’s quest to revive what he believes is China’s rightful global prominence.  Trump’s attacks on allies and desecration of US foreign aid programs are brewing resentment among erstwhile American friends who are now hedging their bets with an alternative superpower. Incredibly, the force doing most to undermine the West is the president of the country — the United States — that guaranteed freedom and democracy for generations. Many steps that Trump takes to demonstrate US power end up undermining it. By taking on Beijing in a , Trump picked on the one nation that would be ready to absorb economic pain to damage the US. Now, Trump has found that Beijing has, well, a trump card: control of a large share of rare earth metals that the US needs to run its tech industry and military applications. Trump’s failure to force Beijing to back down is enhancing a sense that it’s ready to challenge American might — and drawing foreign leaders to Beijing. Trump’s capricious on US trading partners — based on his hunches rather than economic data — and attempts to throttle the play into China’s previously unconvincing claims that it, and not the United States, is the stable superpower on which partners can rely. Nations represented in Tianjin, for example, included many that looked to Washington rather than Beijing in recent years, including Vietnam — which is facing —Egypt, and NATO member Turkey. The most startling example of Trump’s clumsy, counterproductive behavior shone through the attention lavished throughout the summit in Tianjin on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow populist nationalist leader and erstwhile friend of Trump. Trump’s claims to have solved a flare-up between India and Pakistan earlier this year and demands for the Nobel Peace Prize infuriated Modi. A 50% tariff on Indian imports to the US fractured nearly 30 years of efforts by Republican and Democratic presidents to prevent India and China — which are home to a billion people each — from moving closer together. and shaking hands, both argued their two countries, long separated by mistrust, could be partners and not rivals. Modi’s interaction with a jovial Putin was even more overt. Last month, the Russian leader had a private chat in Trump’s Beast limousine at their summit in Alaska. In China, Putin one-upped Trump, inviting Modi into his ride, and a photographer was on hand to capture the . Xi’s welcome to Modi matched that of Putin. India is “signaling to the US that ‘we have alternatives, and China can be that alternative,’” Wong told Anderson on CNN International. “I would say China is leveraging that opportunity.” Trump’s misstep is more surprising since he jelled with Modi during his first term. But India is a deeply proud nation whose colonial history makes it especially sensitive to being bullied. It is hyper-touchy about anything to do with its arch-rival Pakistan. Such subtleties seem to escape the White House. Perhaps Trump’s is taking a toll. Russia is often portrayed in the West as a decrepit power; a shadow of the Soviet Union despite its vast nuclear arsenal. There’s some truth to this after 25 years of Putin’s corrupt rule. But the Russian leader buttressed his image in defying Trump. This has left the US president expressing disappointment and resorting to his classic tactic of teasing apparently imminent announcements to spare his embarrassment. He told reporters Tuesday he’d spoken to Putin and “learned things that will be very interesting. I think in the next few days, you’ll find out.” Many foreign policy experts thought a shrewd second term goal for Trump would be to push US adversaries like Russia, China and North Korea apart. Instead, he’s driven them together, and driven India, a member of the US “Quad” grouping with Australia and Japan, closer into their orbit. Trump’s supporters dispute any characterization of his foreign policy as anything but a roaring success. The White House argues that the United States has never been more respected in the world. It bills Trump as the “President of Peace” and claims he’s — even though some of the nations it names weren’t fighting each other when Trump intervened. The president told CNN contributor Scott Jennings on his radio show on Tuesday that he wasn’t concerned at all by the diplomatic signaling coming from China. He also implied in a conversation with reporters in the Oval Office that Xi would be forced to capitulate. “China needs us. And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, as you know. But China needs us much more than we need them.” Meanwhile, Trump is making overt attempts to prove he’s as tough as any global strongman. On Monday, as superpower diplomacy played out across the Pacific, he announced a US strike that killed 11 people in the , which officials said targeted drug traffickers. The attack could herald a military campaign on questionable legal ground regarding congressional authorization. He also re-upped threats to as he methodically escalates his effort to normalize the use of the military in law enforcement despite constitutional curbs. But there was a reminder that despite his authoritarian instincts, the United States still has democratic safeguards that Russia and China lacks when a judge ruled that his to Los Angeles earlier this year was illegal. The president does have some significant second-term wins. His wielding of US might against smaller nations has tariff cash . And despite his stumbling, he remains the only world leader with a chance to force all parties to the table in pursuit of peace in Ukraine. His relentless pressure on NATO allies led to significant pledges of increased defense spending. But China’s superpower coming-out party this week shows it’s critical for US power that he somehow prevails over Beijing in the trade war. Oodles of flattery that the president has enjoyed from foreign leaders seeking to dodge his wrath may be giving him a false impression of how the rest of the world sees him. “Our country is the hottest country in the world right now,” Trump said Tuesday. “Everybody’s talking about the USA.” The United States was likely on the lips of many of those gathered in China this week. But not quite in the way Trump thinks.", "tags": ["china", "foes", "great", "furious"]},
{"content": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping told India’s Narendra Modi the “right choice” is for their countries to be friends as the two met in China for first time in seven years – a new milestone in a nascent rapprochement between the world’s most populous nations accelerated by shared frictions with the United States. Xi and Modi’s highly-anticipated meeting Sunday, on the sidelines of a regional summit in the eastern port city of Tianjin, comes as both nations face stiff US tariffs under President Donald Trump’s global trade war, as well as Western scrutiny over their relationships with Russia as the war in Ukraine grinds on. “The world today is swept by once-in-a-century transformations,” Xi told Modi in opening remarks, as both leaders sat face-to-face flanked by their officials. “The international situation is both fluid and chaotic,” he added. “It is the right choice for both sides to be friends who have good neighborly and amicable ties, partners who enable each other’s success, and to have the dragon and the elephant dance together,” Xi said, referring to traditional symbols of the two nations. “As long as they adhere to the overall direction of being partners rather than rivals … China-India relations can maintain stability and move forward over the long run,” he said. Modi said India was “committed” to taking their countries’ relations forward “on the basis of mutual trust and respect,” and referenced their bettering of ties, including an easing of tensions along their disputed Himalayan border – where the two fought a deadly skirmish in 2020. “The interests of 2.8 billion people in both our countries are tied to our cooperation,” he added. The positive signals are sure to be closely watched in Washington, where tensions with New Delhi threaten to derail what had been years of efforts from US diplomats to deepen ties with the country as a key counterweight to a rising and increasingly assertive China – a set of circumstances that makes the latest meeting all the more important and timely to Xi. Trump earlier this month levied significant economic penalties on India, initially placing its imports into the US under 25% tariffs and then slapping an additional 25% duties on the country as punishment for importing Russian oil and gas, which Washington sees as helping to fund Putin’s war in Ukraine. Both China and India are major purchasers of Russian oil, though China has yet to be targeted with such measures. Modi said he spoke with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky Saturday and “exchanged views on the ongoing conflict.” India has previously said it does not take sides in the war. In his daily address on Sunday, Zelensky said that “everyone in the world has said that the fighting must be ceased,” including Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, who he noted were in China for the summit. “Almost everyone else in the world is also in favor of ending the war,” he continued. India’s oil purchases could be a point of discussion on Monday, when Modi is expected to hold bilateral talks with Putin, part of his wider diplomacy as he joins a two-day summit of the Beijing-and Moscow-backed regional security grouping known as the (SCO). In addition to China, Russia, and India, the group includes Iran, Pakistan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, as well as partner and observer countries. Chinese officials ahead of the event said leaders from more than 20 countries from across Asia and Middle East would join the summit. Xi hosted attending leaders for a welcome banquet on Sunday evening, where he appeared to put his warm and relaxed rapport with Putin on show. Footage released by Russia state news agency RIA showed the two leaders gesturing animatedly and smiling as they chatted at the event, showing a different side of the typically restrained Chinese leader. The pair then walked shoulder to shoulder together after posing for a photo alongside other gathered leaders, with Xi gesturing for Putin to walk with him, footage released by the Kremlin showed. The SCO is the two leaders’ first opportunity to meet in person since Putin’s summit with Trump in Alaska earlier this month – part of the US president’s push to end the war in Ukraine. Xi and Putin “discussed the latest contacts” between the US and Russia during a “detailed conversation,” Russian state media reported Sunday, citing Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov. Putin’s war looms over the SCO gathering and the flurry of diplomacy around it, with the Russian president, who landed in Tianjin earlier Sunday, joining the gathering as Western leaders ramp up pressure on him– and his partners – to end the now more than three-and-half-year invasion. Beijing is widely seen as eager for the newfound tensions between Trump and Modi to reduce what have been burgeoning security ties between the US and India. Chinese officials have watched with unease the elevation of the Quad security dialogue between India, the US and its allies Australia and Japan, widely seen as a bid to counter China. In his remarks to Modi on Sunday, Xi sought to stress commonalities – framing the two countries as at “critical stages of development and rejuvenation,” and calling for them to “focus on development as their greatest common denominator, supporting and advancing each other,” according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry. He also referenced their shared stated aim to make the international order more “multipolar” – a term used by countries, including those within the SCO, to call for international power to be more broadly shared – as opposed to dominated by the US and its allies, as they see it. There has been a gradual normalization of ties between India and China after Modi and Xi met on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia last October, which came as the two sides reached an agreement on military disengagement along their disputed border. In recent months, the countries agreed to restart direct flights cancelled since the Covid-19 pandemic. Beijing also recently agreed to reopen two pilgrimage sites in western Tibet to Indians for the first time in five years, and both started re-issuing tourist visas for each other’s citizens. Earlier this month, following a visit from China’s top diplomat Wang Yi to New Delhi, the two announced “ten points of consensus” on the issue to further reduce tensions. Xi and Modi on Sunday also discussed what’s “happening on the international plain and the challenges it creates,” India Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters on the SCO sidelines, when asked about whether Trump’s tariffs were raised. “They tried to, in a sense, see how to leverage that for building greater understanding between themselves, and how to … take forward the economic and commercial relationship between India and China in the midst of these evolving challenges,” Misri said. Observers say, however, that even as the two leaders seek stability in their relationship, both in terms of trade and security, it will be hard for Xi and Modi to overcome a longstanding lack of personal trust. Underlying tensions between India and China spiked in 2020 following a deadly conflict along their disputed Himalayan border, in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand combat. The two nations maintain a heavy military presence along their 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC) – a boundary that remains undefined and has been a persistent source of friction since their bloody 1962 war. But both leaders on Sunday appeared keen to signal the welcome of a warmer chapter. An Indian readout released following the meeting said they reaffirmed that “their differences should not turn into disputes” and their “stable relationship and cooperation” was necessary for the “growth and development of the two countries, as well as for a multipolar world.” This story has been updated with developments.

{"content": "President Donald Trump made good on his threat to double tariffs on imports from India to 50%, a move that could endanger relations with one of America’s most important trading partners and send consumer prices higher. This comes just weeks after Trump instituted a on Indian goods. Levies on India, , are now among the highest the United States charges across all countries. The latest round of tariffs on India seeks to punish the country for importing Russian oil and helping Russia finance its war with Ukraine, Trump has previously said. The US leader recently held separate meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to help broker a deal to end their years-long war. However, the talks remain at an impasse. and, more recently, consumers, are already seeing resulting from Trump’s tariff campaign while the . The ramped-up levies on Indian goods could worsen both effects. New Delhi signaled it would retaliate against Trump’s tariffs earlier this month, when Trump initially vowed to impose what he referred to as “secondary sanctions.” India’s junior foreign minister, Kirti Vardhan Singh, told reporters Wednesday the government is “taking appropriate steps so that it does not harm our economy and let me assure you that the strength of our economy will carry us through these times.” “Our concern is our energy security, and we will continue to purchase energy sources from whichever country benefits us,” he said. India has accused the Trump administration of unfairly penalizing the country, pointing out that other countries that import oil from Russia aren’t facing such levies. China, for instance, is the top buyer of Russian oil, but its products face a minimum 30% tariff. Trump has warned, though, that other countries that purchase oil from Russia could face higher tariffs soon. The has widened significantly over the past decade, but it’s come as both countries roughly doubled the amount of imported goods from one another. Last year, the United States imported $87 billion worth of goods from India, compared to about $42 billion in American goods exported to India, according to Commerce Department data. As Trump ramped up tariffs on China in his first term and earlier this year, American businesses were incentivized to seek out alternative production locations like India. The top goods the US received from India last year included pharmaceuticals, communications equipment, such as smartphones, and apparel. Smartphones, however, are exempt from so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, which includes the 50% tax on Indian goods. As is the case with almost all country-specific duties Trump has enacted, sectoral tariffs — such as the 50% across-the-board tariff on steel and aluminum, as well as others he’s threatened — won’t be stacked. This means that steel and aluminum products from India there will face a 50% tariff rather than a combined 100% tariff. Meanwhile, the top American exports to India were various oils and gases, chemicals and aerospace products and parts. These industries could be among the most vulnerable if India decides to slap retaliatory tariffs on American goods. But it’s not just physical goods that America has grown increasingly reliant on India for. On top of production centers, American companies, including American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and Google, have deepened their footprint in India in recent years by expanding or opening new offices there. The Indian government could respond to higher tariffs Trump imposed by making it more onerous for such companies to do business there.

{"content": "Five-year-old Pulsing Ajnera was playing with his brothers in a field near their home in the western Indian state of Gujarat, when a lion “came out of nowhere,” his grieving father told CNN. “This lion grabbed the child, my youngest, and left. My family tried everything to rescue him. They threw stones at the lion and a few wooden sticks as well, but (it) dragged him into the jungle,” Heera Ajnera said. The boy’s body was later recovered. Pulsing was one of seven people in India killed by lions in the year to June 2025, taking the total number of fatal attacks in five years to more than 20. Attacks on cattle have almost doubled during the same period, Gujarat officials told CNN. Sporting an unmistakable dark mane and unique folds of skin along their bellies, Asiatic lions are slightly smaller than their African cousins. They once prowled the Middle East and Asia but now Gujarat is home to the world’s last population of wild Asiatic lions. The lions were hunted to the brink of extinction in India, before a ban on killing the cats was put in place in Gujarat a century ago. Recent conservation efforts, have seen the state’s lion population rise by 30% to 891 in the last five years. Conservationists say a large part of the success stems from a unique human-lion  relationship, where locals profit from the presence of lions, and lions are given space to roam.  But that symbiotic relationship is being tested as the lion population grows. “Lions have been found in basement parking lots of hotels…on top of people’s homes. They are resting on terraces. They’re sitting there and roaring,” said wildlife biologist Ravi Chellam, the coordinator of conservation network the Biodiversity Collaborative. “The minute a lion moves into human-dominated habitats, the probability (of it attacking humans) just increases,” he said. For more than a decade, Chellam and other conservationists have been pushing the Gujarat government to move some lions to a second habitat outside the state. But Gujarat’s lions haven’t gone anywhere, and their numbers are continuing to grow – creating the potential for conflict – despite a Supreme Court ruling ordering the government to relocate them. Gir National Park – a 545-square-mile protected area about the size of Los Angeles City – was established in 1965 to protect endangered species, including Asiatic lions. Most of Gujarat’s Asiatic lions now live outside the park’s borders, mixing with humans in towns and villages. “Theoretically, it’s a success story because that was the whole intention of a conservation project – to increase the number of individuals of that species,” Gujarat-based conservationist Jehan Bhujwala told CNN. “But when you have too many animals, they claim space outside of the protected area… and then they start coming into conflict with local (people),” he said. Bhujwala says India’s conservation model was never intended to separate lions from humans, noting that villages are built within national parks. “They all coexisted, and that coexistence, that tolerance, is something which is very unique to India’s conservation history,” he said. Local people rely on lions to generate tourism income, and in return big cats feed on old cattle abandoned by local herders, wrote Yadvendradev Vikramsinh Jhala, the former dean of Wildlife Institute of India, in an academic paper published last year. Jhala and his co-authors said the lions also prey on pigs and nilgais – a type of antelope - which helps eliminate animals the local farmers consider to be pests. The community has learned to live with lions because their economic benefits outweigh the risks, said Jhala. “Such a level of coexistence between people and a large carnivore is not seen anywhere in the world,” he told CNN. The tie with the local people runs deep. “If there are Maldharis, there are lions. We are one,” said Lakshman, a 32-year-old farmer from the local Maldhari community. But Lakshman, who farms buffaloes and sells their milk to support his five children and wife, said he had noticed an uptick in lion attacks on cattle, which experts say have deepened grievances within the pastoral community. Conservationists warn the dynamic between lions and humans could soon change if more is not done to address the lions’ growing population. Chellam is among a group of conservationists who have been urging the government to move some of the lions to Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. A survey he and other scientists completed three decades ago found it to be a suitable habitat for lion conservation. The call was at the heart of a court battle jointly filed by the Centre for Environment Law and the World Wide Fund for Nature India against the government in 1994 to force local officials in Gujarat to act. In 2013, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of the environmental groups, directing the Ministry of Environment to take “urgent steps for the re-introduction of Asiatic Lions from Gir Forests to Kuno.” It was to be initiated within six months, starting with the formation of an expert committee. Chellam, who’s on the committee, said the last meeting was held in 2016. He says by not convening regular meetings, the government is dragging its feet on the Supreme Court order. More than a decade after the ruling, the lions remain solely in Gujarat. Further complicating the process is the arrival of cheetahs imported from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary. The first cheetahs arrived in India in after their extinction in the country. Some cubs died soon after, but 31 are now living in Kuno, indicating “successful population growth,” The cheetah program is part of the Indian government’s push to transform the country into a global leader in feline conservation. In 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the International Big Cat Alliance to save seven big cats – tigers, lions, leopards, snow leopards, cheetahs, jaguars and pumas – Chellam said the cheetahs’ presence in Kuno would further delay the lion translocation – if it’s still the plan – by up to 20 years – the time it takes for the cheetah population to settle before another species can be brought in. Gujarat’s Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Jaipal Singh declined CNN’s request to comment on the latest developments. Resistance to the translocation also comes from local authorities and people in the tourism industry, who are wary of losing business and the state’s exclusivity as the only place in India to see lions in the wild, Chellam explained. The Gujarat government has come up with an alternative to the Kuno translocation. It’s proposing to move some lions to the Barda Wildlife Sanctuary within state borders, noting that 17 Asiatic lions had been sighted there for the first time since 1879. It’s also increased funding for lion protection by over 70% in the last three years to $18.2 million in 2023-2024 – a sign of its commitment to protecting the species. But Chellam says Barda is too small and short on prey to sustain a viable lion population. It’s also too close to Gir National Park to prevent the spread of disease, meaning a catastrophic pandemic could wipe out Gujarat’s entire population of Asiatic lions. “Having all your eggs in one basket is very risky. If there is a disease outbreak, then there is trouble for you,” he said. Pulsing’s father, Ajnera, used to think that humans could co-exist with lions. He moved to the Amreli district, known for lion sightings, seven years ago as a farm laborer. His home was 200 meters away from the forest, and it never occurred to him that lions would attack humans. “This generally does not happen here,” he said. Now, the grieving father has changed his mind. “We could not live there anymore. We left the area and moved to another village 5 kilometers (3 miles) away – out of fear,” he said.", "tags": ["lion", "celebration", "population", "india", "problem"]},
{"content": "Two decades ago, Jinul Abedeen left his family and moved to capital where he spent a year learning Zardozi, an ancient and intricate threadwork technique he hoped would equip him to support his family for decades to come. The gamble succeeded. He landed a job at Orient Craft, a major garment factory on the outskirts of New Delhi that supplies global brands like Gap, Ralph Lauren, and American Eagle. For 12 years, he has created pieces destined for clothing racks 8,000 miles away in the United States. “This is a true skill,” he said, recalling that year spent learning his craft when he lived on his meagre savings, as his needle moved across a sheer piece of fabric to form a flower petal. “Otherwise, it would not take a year to learn.” Now, that hard-won livelihood, is threatened by a force beyond his control. On Wednesday, the White House imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods – some of the highest the US has imposed on any of its trade partners in what is already a historic global trade war – threatening to decimate business that depends on Indian exports like textiles, diamonds, steel and automobiles Half of the 50% levies are Donald Trump’s punishment for India’s ramped-up purchases of Russian oil following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The other half are part of Trump’s signature “American First” campaign to reduce US trade deficits – in the case with India, . Both are clashing with the “Make in India” dream of fellow populist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who envisions turning his country into a manufacturing powerhouse to power economic growth and lift millions out of poverty. As India’s biggest export market, the US is – or at least was – a big part of that dream. On the floor of Orient Craft, which exports about 82% of its products to the US, gloom is settling in. “It has caused a lot of difficulties, and the company is in trouble,” Abedeen said. “If the company is in trouble, we are in trouble. If the country is in trouble, we are in trouble.” It’s a problem Modi can’t afford, with tens of millions of young people already struggling to enter the job market in the world’s fastest growing major economy. Neeraj Pandey has been at the factory for 22 years. From his modest monthly income of about $205, he has funded his daughter’s MBA and his son’s master’s degree. But the new tariffs threaten to unravel his life. “We could lose everything,” he said. “Our employment will be gone.” For Sumitra Devi, working at Orient Craft’s factory in the neighboring state of Jharkhand was more than a job. “Women from my village don’t usually work. I was a housewife,” she said. Her factory earnings changed everything. She put her children through private school, and now her elder daughter dreams of becoming an engineer. For Devi, a school dropout, this is a “matter of pride.” Now, she fears that new tariffs could erase it all. “My husband’s salary isn’t enough,” she said. “If I lose my job, the girls will have to go back to a government school… and my daughters are so proud. They say, ‘Look, my mother works.’” Pandey and Devi’s stories cut to the heart of a grand national ambition: Modi’s “Make in India,” a strategy built on making goods domestically to sell to the world. Launched in 2014, this flagship program is central to the Indian leader’s political brand, built on promises of national pride and future greatness for the nation of 1.4 billion. The government has poured into incentives for sectors like apparel, to reduce India’s reliance on imports and create a manufacturing powerhouse. While there have been shortfalls – manufacturing’s share of GDP is – it has undeniably elevated India on the world stage, offering a real alternative to China for some investors and consumer brands. Orient Craft’s owner, Sudhir Dhingra, called this period “very challenging.” Some orders from American buyers have already been put on hold, he said. Hemant Makhija, who heads the fabrics department at Orient Craft, estimates some 20 million workers at cotton mills across India could be out of a job. “Mills across the national capital region are already operating at 50% capacity despite this being peak season,” he said. Ajay Srivastava, a former trade official who runs New Delhi’s Global Trade Research Initiative, predicts the levies will hit export hubs hard, with US orders worth $5.4 billion likely to plummet by 60% to 90%. For Dhingra, the human cost is the most alarming part. “It’s very painful (for the workers) to sustain their families,” he said. “This is worse than Covid.” The western city of Surat is the epicenter of the global diamond industry, a massive processing hub, where skilled artisans handle about 90% of the world’s rough diamonds, polishing them to make them ready for the global market. The sector, which employs about 5 million people nationwide, contributes about 7% of the country’s GDP, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF). “The US remains highly dependent on Indian diamonds,” said Jayantibhai Savaliya, regional chairman of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council in India. “Any slowdown will have a 100% impact, potentially leading to job losses and salary cuts.” While recent shipments provide a temporary buffer, he expects exports to decline significantly over the next eight months, calling the situation a “wake-up call” for the industry to diversify its markets. Under his turbocharged “America First” foreign policy, Trump has prioritized his own national interests, economic self-sufficiency, and sovereignty – much like Modi, his nationalist counterpart in New Delhi. The position seeks to reshore manufacturing to the US. But in doing so, it could sacrifice Washington’s long-standing courtship of New Delhi as a vital counterweight to China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The primary source of friction is the US trade deficit with India, which has widened significantly over the last decade, even as bilateral trade has roughly doubled. The US was India’s largest trade partner as of 2024, yet India ranked tenth in the list of US trading partners for the same year. The bilateral trade between the US and the world’s most populous nation was $129.2 billion in 2024, a record for the partnership. The high levies could effectively erase India from the US in some key markets like garments, Srivastava, from the Global Trade Research Initiative, said. It “makes Indian garments uncompetitive against Vietnam’s 20% and China’s 42%,” he added, “leaving little chance to retain US buyers.” Still, he noted while tariffs will hurt export-heavy sectors like apparel, textiles, jewelry and seafood, these form about 20% of India’s GDP – with US exports counting for a fifth of that. “Strong domestic demand, 6–7% growth, and ongoing reforms… will cushion the impact, preventing a systemic crisis,” Srivastava said, adding: “India may face short-term pain, but its vast domestic market will cushion the blow, enabling a quick rebound.” ﻿The anxiety has nevertheless made Dhingra from Orient Craft begin to think of alternatives. “Russia is an unexplored market. I would say parts of Europe, we could grab business there? We could also go to South America, which we have not done,” he said. “But my worry is that it (the tariffs) will leave a very deep scar in the Indo-American relationship.” While many nations have rushed to strike trade deals with Trump to lower tariffs, Modi has been less willing to cave. New Delhi called the tariffs “unfair” and “unjustified,” pointing out the hypocrisy of Trump’s move, noting that the US and Europe still buy Russian fertilizers and chemicals. Earlier this month Modi said India “will never compromise on the interests of farmers, fishermen and dairy farmers.” “I know personally, I will have to pay a heavy price for it, but I am ready for it,” he added. To mitigate the impact, the government has announced some countermeasures, including suspending import duties on raw materials and accelerating trade talks to diversify export markets. But for regular factory workers, this means little. “If my job goes away, I have no other work. I don’t know how to do anything else,” Pandey said. “If they can come to a compromise, that would be better. If not, what can we do?” Ayushi Shah contributed reporting.", "tags": ["livelihoods", "millions", "line", "india", "vision"]},
{"content": "This week, Russian President Vladimir Putin had a clear message for Ukraine and its European allies: Moscow can keep going, because we have powerful friends. The Russian leader stood at various events in China with the men who have enabled him to wage his war on Ukraine for as long and as ferociously as he has: China’s leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. More than three years into what Putin once thought would be a quick takeover of his much smaller and weaker neighbor, Russia would be unable to sustain the fight without Chinese and Indian money, Iranian weapons and, to a lesser extent, manpower from North Korea. But the messaging from both the summit and hosted by China this week went well beyond the war in Ukraine. The leaders who gathered in China may not agree on everything. Some of them may not even like each other very much. But they are seeing the opportunity of a lifetime to end Western dominance of the global stage. And Europe fears it could be in the firing line. The events provided a stark visual reminder of why Europe must rethink its security. It has spent recent years trying to isolate Russia’s leader and starve its economy, while also coming to terms with the fact that the United States . Yet there was Putin, standing together with some of the world’s most powerful men, reaffirming their friendships. “Russia is trying to demonstrate that even though it has been isolated from the Western world, it still has partners and allies which are economically strong countries… And this isolation doesn‘t mean that the Russian economy will crumble or that Russia will be unable to sustain its war effort,” Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told CNN. The international order that was set after the end of the Cold War is clearly at risk of unraveling. The US has been retreating from the global stage under President Donald Trump and his “America First” agenda. Meanwhile, Europe is battling its own demons, including a surge in far-right nationalism and economic pressures. Russia, China, India and other countries that did not like the idea of a US-dominated world suddenly saw an opening. “The established dominance of the Western alliance in international affairs is receding, and they see the opportunity to start to, in a serious way, re-engineer the international system,” John Lough, head of foreign policy at the New Eurasian Strategies Centre think tank, told CNN. This week has laid these ambitions bare for everyone, including Trump, to see. Trump did get the message. “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,” he in a message to Xi. Despite all the recent hand holding and smiles, China’s and India’s approach to Russia’s war in Ukraine is dominated by pragmatism, analysts say. The two consistently profess their neutrality on the war – while at the same time fueling it by providing financial lifelines to Russia. China and India were more than happy to step in when Ukraine’s Western allies slapped sanctions on Russian oil, a key moneymaker for Moscow. They get cheaper energy supplies as a result, but experts say the relationship is not just about the money. While neither China nor India is willing to enter into a direct confrontation with the West, both are happy to see Russia pushing an anti-Western agenda. “China is much closer to Russia when it comes to multipolarity and decreasing the Western influence in general. There is an ideological affinity and there is a pure economic interest as well,” Seskuria said. Lough said Russia’s push against the US-dominated world order also plays well into the Indian narrative. “I think the Indians are not unhappy to see Russia pushing this agenda of fighting the corner of the Global South and ensuring that the system of global governance is adapted to accommodate the rising economies with large populations,” he told CNN. Beijing and Delhi are now the world’s two largest buyers of Russian oil and coal, with China also being the second-biggest buyer of Russia’s gas and oil products. The support goes beyond just oil. According to the US Treasury, both Chinese and Indian companies have been supplying Russia with so-called dual-use technologies, or components that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, such as chips or telecommunication equipment that Russia cannot get elsewhere because of Western sanctions. “You only have to look at the number of Chinese components in the Russian drones that are landing in Ukraine to see that China is really a very important supplier,” Lough added. Meanwhile, Ukraine and its European allies are not willing to dismiss India and China completely, because they are aware that, if anyone can put real pressure on Putin to end the war –  in the absence of tougher action from Trump –  it is likely Beijing and, perhaps to a lesser extent, New Delhi. North Korea and Iran, meanwhile, have stood firmly on Russia’s side. Already sanctioned and isolated by the West over their nuclear programs and other activities, they have little to lose. Iran was particularly helpful to Moscow in the early months of the war, providing it with know-how on lessening the pain of sanctions, Lough said. Crucially, Iran also provided much-needed military hardware, including the one weapon that has significantly altered the way Moscow fights in Ukraine – . The two countries even signed a agreement and launched joint military drills. Yet Tehran has learned the hard way that any alliance with Russia has clear limits. Putin did not come to Iran’s assistance when it came under attack from Israel and, later, the US this summer. And beyond providing a safe way out for former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, formerly a key ally for both Russia and Iran, Putin did not intervene when Assad’s regime was overthrown in December. For North Korea, isolated and impoverished, the relationship with Russia remains purely transactional, Seskuria said. Russia needs men, and North Korea is possibly the only country that can afford in a political sense to send its own people to fight in a war that has been marked by an enormously high casualty rate on the Russian side. “They don’t have much to lose, in a sense that there is no public opinion or any resistance that can go against the decision of Kim to send troops to Ukraine,” Seskuria said. The warm welcome Putin received in China, coupled with the military and diplomatic might on display during the summit and the military parade, was designed to convey a message. “Here we have this symbol of a group of countries that are not best friends as such, but have common strategic interests and that are able to align and they’re able to show to the US and its allies that they are a force to be reckoned with,” Lough said. “This is unsettling, to say the least, and some would say disturbing, but you then have to ask how sustainable is this?” he said. The shifts the events in China represented did not happen overnight. Europe might have been caught off guard when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it has changed since then. “We are starting to see now what the Europeans are made of and in terms of defense developments in Europe, we can see some remarkable changes,” Lough said. Things that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago – such as Germany changing its constitution to boost defense spending or the staunchly neutral Sweden and Finland joining NATO – are now happening because of the geopolitical shifts that were on display this week. As much as Putin’s chumminess with Xi and Modi might have sparked some discomfort in many European capitals, the group was brought together by a combination of need, economic pragmatism and opportunity, analysts say. “It’s a very functional relationship, that is not based on a strong mutual affection. It’s an alliance of interests rather than an alliance of countries,” Lough said, adding that interests can shift, and a lot of things can happen in the next three and half years of the Trump presidency. “We are not at the stage where it’s kind of suddenly game over, because a bunch of leaders we don’t like have got together in China for a big celebration,” he said.", "tags": ["security", "underscore", "parade", "summit", "european"]},
{"content": "After decades of bottlenecks and delays, Mumbai, one of the world’s most crowded cities, finally has a second airport. For travelers, the new Navi Mumbai International Airport promises shorter lines, more flights and a smoother start or finish to their trip than before. For the city, long throttled by a single overburdened airport, it’s an engineering feat. The airport has been nearly 20 years in the making, a process that involved flattening hills, diverting rivers and bridging creeks. Phase one alone gives the city a terminal built to handle 20 million passengers annually, immediately easing the strain on Mumbai’s existing airport, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International, or BOM. In 2019, BOM handled 48.83 million passengers. And today, as one of Asia’s busiest airports, it already serves more than 54 million travelers a year, making delays, long lines and overcrowding part of the city’s air travel experience. “It’s a great airport. It’s a terrific location,” says Mark D. Martin, an India-based aviation analyst. “But the area is not yet developed. The viability and sustainability of an airport in India purely depend on its access to the population.” The vision for the new Navi Mumbai airport — NMI — takes into account future growth. By 2032, the airport is expected to have four terminals with the capacity for 90 million passengers a year — putting Mumbai in the same league as global multi-airport hubs like London, New York and Dubai. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the airport on October 8. Addressing media on site at NMI, he said “In 2014, we only had 74 airports. Today, we have more than 160. With this new airport, Maharashtra farmers will be able to connect with the supermarkets of Europe and Middle East. And the fishermen’s produce can quickly reach the global market.” According to airport officials, travelers can expect shorter lines, faster check-ins powered by biometrics and smoother connections as airlines begin to expand their routes. And they are already lining up. Air India Group says its low-cost arm, Air India Express, will begin to offer 20 daily departures out of the new airport, which includes international destinations. IndiGo, the nation’s largest carrier, will move dozens of daily flights to the airport once operations commence, and add international routes by November. Homegrown budget airline Akasa Air is also moving in, with more than 100 weekly flights to start. Cargo operations will be just as vital. The airport debuts with 800,000 tons of annual capacity, vital to Mumbai’s role as a pharmaceutical and e-commerce hub. A general aviation terminal will house up to 75 business jets, the largest such facility in India. It’s no secret that NMI was intended to bring India’s aviation industry up to par with other Asian mega-hubs. Jeet Adani, director of airports for the Adani Group, which is the key funder of NMI, cited top Asian airports as benchmarks. “Singapore Changi is known for efficiency and passenger experience. NMI is designed to exceed it in ultimate capacity, while matching its digital backbone. Seoul Incheon and Tokyo Narita are examples of Asian order and technology. We aim to meet those benchmarks on airside, while surpassing them in growth headroom,” he said. Visually, NMI was designed to make a statement. Created by Zaha Hadid Architects, its lotus-shaped terminal draws on an ancient Indian motif for purity and resilience. A canopy of golden petals crowns the roof, while interiors blend jaali latticework with modern glass and light to create a softer, calmer passenger experience. Sustainability runs throughout the design — from natural cooling to renewable energy and water recycling. Inside, the airport promises modern lounges, dining and tech-enabled services aimed at cutting hassle out of the journey. Getting there, however, remains a sticking point. Connectivity to Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMI) is as ambitious as the terminal itself — but on the ground, the picture is more complicated. The Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, India’s biggest sea bridge, has technically cut travel time to 20 minutes from South Mumbai. But peak-hour traffic on connecting roads could stretch that journey much longer to a couple of hours. Martin, the aviation analyst, believes that only time will tell how NMI fits into India’s transit framework. “It takes time for an airport to mature. When you create an airport, it takes time for the additional support systems — things like hotels, accommodation, and access to the city through a strong taxi, metro, bus, or rail network — to develop in equal proportion.” Metro extensions and express bus routes are still works in progress. Shuttle services will depend on careful coordination with train and bus timetables — not always a given in Mumbai’s tangled transport network. And with no direct metro connection from key commercial districts at launch, most passengers will likely turn to cars and taxis, adding pressure to already clogged roads. According to Devandra Fadnavis, Chief Minister of Maharashtra state, a water taxi service will run between the Gateway of India monument and NMI. He did not spell out specific plans or a timeline. For Mumbai, NMI is both a relief and a test. It promises smoother journeys and new opportunities, but its success will hinge on whether the city can solve the ground transport snags that still frustrate travelers. If connectivity catches up with ambition, this second airport could finally give Mumbai the breathing room its passengers have long needed.", "tags": ["mega", "hills", "decades", "india", "rivers", "delays", "opens"]},
{"content": "There’s a photo of my mother on her wedding day that I love. She’s sipping soda and laughing with relatives at my parent’s Chinese banquet, looking radiant in her evening gown: a strapless, mandarin orange dress that puffs out towards the floor, princess-style. A classic pillbox hat sits poised over her trimmed bob; a sheer shawl drapes over her delicate arms. It’s a striking and unusual look for a Hong Kong bride in the 1980s. Inspired by Western haute couture, she designed her wedding gowns (in Chinese weddings, the bride wears several outfits), hiring a neighbor who was a seamstress to help sew. “We didn’t have money for new dresses and I wanted something special that fit my identity. So, I made it myself!” she said. I came across the photo while seeking inspiration for my own wedding. I had recently gotten married to my partner in a small civil ceremony in London, and we planned to host a proper wedding in Hong Kong a few months later. I also wanted to pick dresses that could reflect “identity” and personal taste. Unlike my mum, who married another Hongkonger and never left the city, I’ll be the first in my family to settle in Britain and marry a partner who is White and British. My fiancé is also the first in his close family to marry a non-White immigrant. Rather than shying away from the challenges of navigating an interethnic marriage, we wanted to actively celebrate and engage with each other’s cultural heritages at our wedding. I was excited and couldn’t wait to plan everything — starting with my dress. It was supposed to be easy: I’ll just find something that feels ‘right,’ I thought to myself. Something that isn’t too expensive, that stylistically honors both Chinese and Western traditions. It wasn’t. As soon as I started looking online, I became overwhelmed. My searching prompted a barrage of questions: Should I wear a Chinese cheongsam (qipao) or a white wedding dress? How about both, or neither? Should we do a tea ceremony and rent two-piece qun kwa outfits (traditional Chinese tea ceremony attire)? Or wear Western clothing, but in colors like red and gold that symbolize prosperity in Chinese culture? Before I knew it, I was up until four in the morning on Instagram scrolling over “inspo” pics, feeling like I’d tripped and fallen into the industrial wedding complex vortex and couldn’t claw my way out. I also had a tough time finding bridal shops in London, where I’m based, offering high quality and contemporary Chinese designs (which is strange considering how many overseas Chinese and Asian people live here.) It turns out, I wasn’t alone in my struggle. Jenn Qiao, the co-founder of US-based bridal brand , started her company five years ago after failing to find a modern cheongsam for her own wedding. “The choices seemed to be dealing with sketchy sellers on Alibaba or impatient grannies in Chinatown,” she writes on the brand’s website. “My maid of honor and I thought: this isn’t an isolated experience,” Qiao explained on a phone call, adding that she ended up wearing a pink cheongsam that she eventually designed herself. “Now, our mission is to offer modern styles that fuse your ethnicity and heritage to your current style.” They started off creating bespoke and ready-to-wear cheongsams, but have since received a growing number of requests for “fusion” gowns from mixed couples. “One bride marrying a Mexican (man) wanted to incorporate this shade of blue commonly seen in Mexican art, so we customized one of our dresses in white and included blue embroidery,” Qiao said. It’s a niche but growing market. In addition to playing with color, dressmakers also experiment with different materials and silhouettes. , a Hong Kong-based brand, offers diverse cheongsam designs with functional elements like zippers (rather than the traditional knotted buttons) to prioritize comfort and versatility, as well as fun takes (like a white halter with a feathery trim). “We have brides of different shapes who don’t want to wear something so form-fitting,” said Julie Liu, Qipology’s founder. “(Modernization) is not really about how to incorporate the Western world, but about: ‘how do I look good in the qipao and not show everyone my belly?’” Grace Pei, a designer at US-based Jinza Oriental Couture, said that over 90% of her clients are in interethnic relationships and planning multicultural weddings. “I realized that everyone wants to honor their heritage, but nobody knows how,” she said in a phone interview. Pei recently a guide on the topic, recommending that couples include tea ceremonies and Chinese lion dances, and to weave in cultural symbols into the decor — such as using peonies, lotuses and cherry blossoms with orchids or roses into floral centerpieces. As time went on, I realized that my anxieties were less about the dress itself, and more about what it had come to represent: my sense of identity in a mixed marriage. Now that I’ve chosen to live in a predominantly White society and marry a White partner, I feel increasingly protective of my Hong Kong heritage and defensive against assimilation. The pressure I have felt has been exacerbated by the racist and sexist backlash in recent years to East Asian women marrying outside their race, which has become a negative cultural trope (see this that blew up on TikTok and shames Asian women for dating white men, or this by Chinese American author Celeste Ng about how she was harassed for marrying her White husband). My anxiety was compounded by questions on what the wedding would actually look like. How do you honor multiple cultures on such a momentous occasion? Should we hire a translator for our tea ceremony? How should we approach asking western guests to prepare lai see for the occasion (red envelopes of money to wish the bride and groom good fortune)? Should we serve Chinese or Western food? Should we seat guests by family, as per Chinese traditions, or seat both families together? And, at the crux of these concerns: Would we be able to make choices that cater to both families, who have drastically different cultural expectations? Will they accept us and embrace each other moving forward? My partner also felt overwhelmed by these choices, but tried to reassure me that our extended families — who would be meeting for the first time — would share in our joy on the big day, regardless of its shape or form. Yet every decision still felt fraught with tension; like a choice of one culture over another. When I confessed all of this to a Chinese friend, who recently married her Italian husband, I was relieved to hear she had similar concerns. She had worried that her attempts to honor her cultural heritage would be perceived negatively, and seen as culturally performative. They decided to stick to clothing from their respective cultures: she wore a cheongsam and he wore a Western suit. “I didn’t want us to be viewed as just ‘an interracial couple’ or have it framed as: ‘look at this White man (wearing) traditional Chinese wedding attire,’” she told me. “I wanted guests to see us as two individuals celebrating our love, rather than (as) cultural symbols.” Her words resonated; they reminded me why I was trying so hard to be culturally thoughtful in the first place. We wanted to celebrate our love and respect for one another, as well as our families. At the end of the day, the best we can do is keep these intentions at the forefront of our decisions, and go with what feels right as a couple. And for us, it ultimately meant choosing several outfits to honor both Western and Chinese traditions — and to engage our loved ones in the process. I went shopping with one of my bridesmaids in London, where we stumbled upon a delicately embroidered white dress with a short train that was on sale (it was fate, we declared), and bought it to wear for our drinks reception. My dad gifted my partner one of his old tuxedos for the big day, and my sister persuaded me to rent a party dress for the karaoke dance portion of our wedding (neither a Chinese or Western tradition, but very me). The dress was Western in design, but in the lucky Chinese color red — a nod to both cultures. These joyful moments were on my mind the morning of our Hong Kong wedding, when we gathered both families together in my family home to take part in the tea ceremony. We wore rented qun kwas for that, and even got one for my mum, who couldn’t afford to do so at her own wedding. Together, my husband and I held hands and stood in front of our loved ones: me in a high-collared red jacket and long skirt, with delicately embroidered phoenixes and beaded tassels that spun with each step; my partner in a matching Tang suit, with a pair of dragons dancing over waves of gold and silver. I looked over his shoulder and saw my mum tearing up, hand over her heart, radiant in her dark burgundy qun kwa. “You look beautiful,” she mouthed, and I smiled back. I did feel beautiful. I felt like me.", "tags": ["dress", "multicultural", "difficult", "harder", "wedding"]},
{"content": "In Morris Lum’s photographic archive of Chinatowns, change is the only constant. Wall murals are painted then covered up. Restaurant menus adapt to diners’ evolving palates. Colorful shopfronts fade and are replaced, as family businesses fall victim to rising rents or the disinterest of children and grandchildren. “That’s the life cycle of a Chinatown,” said Lum, who has spent more than a decade documenting commerce, community and architecture in Asian enclaves across the US and Canada. To date, the photographer has visited over 20 Chinatowns, from Chicago to Winnipeg. His paints a varied portrait through courtyards, alleyways and community buildings, whether clan associations or Methodist churches, that have offered refuge and camaraderie to generations of Asian diasporas. But it is the eye-catching, bilingual facades of restaurants and businesses — gift shops, bakeries, insurers, reflexologists, florists, grocers, travel agencies and acupuncturists — that bring the work to life. In a video interview from his home in Toronto, Lum said he “really just wanted to keep a record” of Chinatowns. But his archive serves more than posterity. Often returning to the same sites over several years, he captures real-time visual evidence of shifting migration patterns and demographic trends. In one image, a shiny new “K-Beauty” business in Philadelphia stands on what was once the site of a poké bowl and tea bar, a testament to the meteoric rise of South Korean cosmetics. Others show newer storefronts adorned with simplified Chinese characters, not traditional ones, as arrivals from mainland China come to significantly outnumber those from Taiwan or Hong Kong, the source of earlier waves of migration to the US. Elsewhere, shops and restaurants lie dormant or blanketed in graffiti. Several more of the businesses have closed their doors since Lum photographed them. Among them are New York City’s New Golden Fung Wong Bakery, which shuttered in 2024 after more than 60 years in Manhattan, and Vancouver’s Ho Sun Hing Printers, closed in 2014 after more than a century in operation. The circumstances vary. Ho Sun Hing, for instance, struggled to adapt to digital printing. And closures do not necessarily reflect lack of demand (New Golden Fung Wong was replaced by another bakery). There is, nonetheless, an overriding theme in Lum’s photos: gentrification. Given their historic links to trade, often occupied downtown locations close to busy ports or densely populated urban centers. These areas have, in many cities, become prohibitively expensive. For family-run businesses, this means higher rents and costlier overheads, as well as the exodus of communities that traditionally patronized them. Then, there are the multitude of other financial pressures facing mom-and-pop stores everywhere, like competition from major chains. “Just the other day, a big sign went up saying a McDonald’s is coming in,” Lum said of a property in Toronto’s Chinatown that was refurbished following a fire, before lying vacant amid the city’s stringent Covid-19 lockdown. “That really speaks to the changing dynamic of Chinatowns.” The pandemic looms large in the recent history of Chinatowns. In her introduction to Lum’s book, author and academic Lily Cho wrote that the , stemming from the epicenter of the virus’ outbreak in Wuhan, China, showed how the neighborhoods “have served as a place of both refuge and violence.” For many of the businesses Lum documented, mask mandates and takeout-only dining were not only commercially devastating but anathema to what he called the “easiness of Chinatown” whereby “you just walk in and know people.” “The hustle and bustle I remember from when I was a kid was completely gone,” he added. Lum’s interest in Chinatowns traces back to his upbringing. Born in Trinidad and Tobago — to a Chinese Trinidadian father and Macanese mother raised in Hong Kong — he immigrated to Canada as a child in the late 1980s. His family settled in Mississauga, a west Toronto suburb that, although increasingly multicultural, was predominantly White at the time. On the weekends, Lum’s parents would drive him and his sister into the city’s Chinatown. They ate at banquet-style restaurants and shopped for Asian groceries, which were, then, unavailable in their local neighborhood. But the lure of Chinese-owned businesses was not just practical. It was emotional, too: “My parents really craved that sense of familiarity that wasn’t really present in suburbs,” Lum recalled. The photographer experiences a similar sense of comfort when entering Chinatowns for the first time — even in cities he’s never visited before. “There’s this vernacular in most Chinatowns that, once you come across a restaurant or business that has both languages, you feel like, ‘Oh, this is a place that I feel familiar with.’” Yet he is similarly fascinated by what makes each Chinatown unique. Some sprawl out behind elaborate ceremonial gates, while others quietly integrate with the urban fabric; some are significantly pedestrianized, while others center on major intersections. The oldest date to the mid-19th century, while newer enclaves only cropped up in recent decades or, like Toronto’s, relocated from elsewhere in the post-World War II era. Each neighborhood’s identity is, Lum said, informed by its location and history. And this is reflected in the diverse architecture found in his photographs. For every lantern-strewn brick tenement playing into the popular imagination of what Chinatowns looks like (as propagated by movies like “Big Trouble in Little China” and “Rumble in the Bronx”), Lum also captures something more prosaic: a nondescript early-‘90s tower block fronted by a circular moon gate, or Chinese-owned stores jostling for space in a converted Victorian house. The photographer’s favorite Chinatown is, nonetheless, the archetypal one — San Francisco’s, which although largely rebuilt following the 1906 earthquake was founded during the California Gold Rush in the late 1840s. “The density, the way the streets are built and just the amount of people — you can see the layers of the different architecture that have been placed on top of it,” Lum said. “It was the first Chinatown I visited in the US and, compared to Canada, it felt almost like Disneyland.” Lum still works in analog film, not digital. Upon arriving at a new Chinatown, he begins by wandering the streets, a simple 35-millimeter point-and-shoot camera in hand. He keeps note of which addresses he’ll return to with his tripod and large-format equipment. His approach requires long exposure times, so Lum usually shoots early in the morning before shops and restaurants open. Similarly, his interior images contain only indirect signs of life (or the “reminiscence of something that has just happened,” as Lum put it), empty chairs around abandoned mahjong games, for instance, or an ancestral altar recently replenished with flowers. But his wider Chinatown archive is, by no means, people-free. Not featured in his book are portraits and casual shots of friends, shoppers, business owners and community members. Lum always tries to connect with contacts from artistic, photographic and diasporic communities, or local historians and architects, before arriving. It is in these interactions that he, ultimately, finds optimism about the future of North America’s Chinatowns. And, despite the specter of gentrification, his book is littered with success stories. There’s San Francisco’s Li Po Cocktails, the cult favorite dive bar famed for its trademarked Chinese mai tai. There’s The Lingnan, which opened in 1947 and is now Edmonton’s second-oldest restaurant. There are businesses like the Yuen Hop Noodle Company, in Oakland, that have not only endured the decades but overcome a reliance on footfall to become major distributors and wholesalers. “A lot of younger people are interested in opening up shops or being in Chinatown, because it brings this sense of familiarity to them, this sense of home,” Lum added. “But also, there’s this desire to want to build something.”", "tags": ["saw", "chinatowns"]},
{"content": "Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan signed a formal mutual defense pact on Wednesday, in a move that significantly strengthens a decades-long security partnership amid heightened regional tensions. The enhanced defense ties come as Gulf Arab states about the reliability of the United States as their longstanding security guarantor. Israel’s last week heightened those concerns. “This agreement is a culmination of years of discussions. This is not a response to specific countries or specific events but an institutionalization of longstanding and deep cooperation between our two countries,” a senior Saudi official told Reuters when asked about its timing. Israel’s attempt to kill the political leaders of Hamas with airstrikes on Doha, while they were discussing a ceasefire proposal that Qatar is helping to mediate, infuriated Arab countries. The pact could shift the strategic calculus in a complex region. Allies of Washington, Gulf monarchies have sought to stabilize ties with both Iran and Israel to resolve longstanding security concerns. But the Gaza war has upended the region and Gulf state Qatar has been subjected to direct hits twice in a year, once by Iran and once by Israel. The Saudi deal comes months after Pakistan fought a brief military conflict with rival India in May. India’s ministry of external affairs spokesman, Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on social media website X on Thursday that India was aware of the development, adding it would study its implications for New Delhi’s security and for regional stability. The senior Saudi official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the need to balance relations with Pakistan’s rival, India, also a nuclear power. “Our relationship with India is more robust than it has ever been. We will continue to grow this relationship and seek to contribute to regional peace whichever way we can.” Asked whether Pakistan would be obliged to provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella under the pact, the official said: “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.” Pakistani state television showed Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, embracing after signing the agreement. In attendance was Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, regarded as the country’s most powerful person. “This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieving security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defense cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression. The agreement states that any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both,” a statement from the Pakistani prime minister’s office said.", "tags": ["wary", "sign", "security", "pakistan", "guarantees", "mutual", "defense", "arab", "states", "saudi", "arabia", "grow", "pact"]},
{"content": "US cyber officials issued an “emergency directive” Thursday ordering federal agencies to defend their networks against an “advanced” group of hackers that have breached at least one agency in an apparent espionage campaign. Government officials have not commented on who is behind the hacks, but private experts say they believe the hackers are state-backed and based in China. The hackers have been exploiting previously unknown flaws in software made by Cisco for several months. “We are aware of hundreds of these devices [running the affected Cisco software] being in the federal government,” Chris Butera, a senior official at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters. The directive will help officials understand “the full scope of the compromise across federal agencies,” Butera said. Unit 42, a division of cyber firm Palo Alto Networks, told CNN that they believe the hackers are based in China. But a slew of other hacking groups could try to exploit the vulnerabilities now that the issue is public and a software “patch,” or fix, is available. “As we have seen before, now that patches are available, we can expect attacks to escalate as cybercriminal groups quickly figure out how to take advantage of these vulnerabilities,” said Sam Rubin, a senior vice president at Unit 42. The will set off a scramble in Washington to detect the hackers and unplug any compromised devices before the hackers can do further damage. It gives civilian agencies until the end of Friday to update software and report any compromises. A Cisco spokesperson said the company the hacks in May with “several” government agencies and has since discovered three new vulnerabilities that the hackers were exploiting. The company urged its customers to update their software in the face of the attacks. The British government also about the hacking campaign on Thursday, calling the malicious code used by the hackers a “significant evolution” from their previous tools. The disclosure comes just days after researchers with Google-owned firm Mandiant that another team of suspected Chinese hackers had infiltrated US software developers and law firms in a campaign to collect intelligence to help Beijing in its ongoing trade fight with Washington.

{"content": "The neon signs that once illuminated Hong Kong have mostly gone dark. The lights were once synonymous with the city, but in recent years, the government has tightened regulations over safety concerns about unwieldy signs, and many have been removed. But inside a workspace in the Wong Chuk Hang neighborhood, neon lights are shining bright. Jive Lau founded the Kowloneon studio in 2021, with the hopes of preserving the craft of neon making. He had long been interested in neon when, in 2019, he took a week off from his job as a graphic designer to fly to Taiwan for a neon-making course. When Lau, now 42, was laid off during the Covid-19 pandemic, he took it as a sign to devote himself to neon full-time. Now he’s achieving commercial success with his designs — including an elaborate neon façade for the US fashion brand Coach, a sign for a Louis Vuitton event, and light installations for . Through his work, Lau hopes he can help reverse neon’s decline in the city. “Neon is not replaceable,” he tells CNN from his workshop, illuminated by a neon cow shaking maracas mounted on the wall behind him. “It’s magical.” Neon signs were first introduced in Hong Kong in . As the city’s economy flourished from the 1950s to the 1980s, neon did also, according to Brian Kwok, an associate professor of design at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and author of “Fading Neon Lights, an Archive of Hong Kong’s Visual Culture.” The lights were once used to advertise everything from tailor shops and bars to seafood restaurants, but in recent decades, the neon industry has been in decline. , the city’s Buildings Department found there were about 120,000 signboards in the city, including neon, many of them unauthorized. Stricter regulation has led to the removal of many signs, like a well-known neon cow measuring three meters (10 feet) hanging above Sammy’s Kitchen, a steakhouse, which was taken down in after being deemed an illegal structure. Some local business owners have willingly replaced the signs with newer technology, including LED lights, which are cheaper. Societal factors, like an association with seediness, have also contributed to neon’s decline, according to the city’s . Kwok tells CNN that in 2018 and 2019, when he was doing research for his book, there were about 470 neon signs left in the five Hong Kong districts he surveyed. Today, he thinks that only about 10% of those remain. Making neon signs is a delicate and difficult task that entails using powerful burners to heat and shape glass tubes and injecting the right mixture of gas into the tubes, which must be connected seamlessly so the joints can’t be seen. There aren’t many people left that know how to do the painstaking and delicate work. Kwok estimates that there are about three to five remaining neon masters in Hong Kong, with only one or two actively working in the craft. In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the disappearing neon, which has drawn media and public attention. A few artists like Lau have started working with neon at a time when the city is undergoing rapid changes. That includes a Beijing-led crackdown on dissent, following pro-democracy protests in 2019, which critics say has stifled creative expression and subdued the once freewheeling city. Many young Hong Kongers have left the city. “Neon is representative of Hong Kong,” says Lau. “If the most beautiful and representative things of Hong Kong fade out, I will be really sad,” he adds. Some Hong Kong brands continue to incorporate neon into their stores. Lau has designed signs for and a large neon installation he created sits atop the flagship store of local retailer Goods of Desire (G.O.D) in the central nightlife area . He says that unlike the old neon masters, who largely made signs with just the name of the shop they advertised, he takes a more creative approach to his designs. His sign above G.O.D., for example, depicts characters holding a wine glass and pouring tea. In his studio, where he receives subsidized rent from the government-backed Hong Kong Arts Development Council, tools cover the walls, and are scattered across worktop tables, while the remnants of broken tubes litter the floor. He shows CNN a neon sign taller than him, with intricately bent neon depicting a phoenix and a dragon — symbols common as a backdrop for Chinese wedding photos — which he says took him a month to make. He also uses neon to create sculptures and is planning for an upcoming exhibition. And he’s working to open a store that will sell neon objects suitable for Hong Kong’s notoriously cramped apartments. He shows CNN a small sculptural neon lightning bolt mounted on a base. “I want to reach a different kind of consumer,” says Lau. Kwok sees similar trends among Hong Kong’s handful of neon makers. “The whole industry has shifted to more art-related projects, or small-scale projects for interior decoration,” he says. Lau wants to encourage more people into the art form and late last year, he launched a three-month internship program to teach other young people the craft. His initial batch of eight apprentices included students and professionals working in fields ranging from technology to art repair. He plans to run a second internship program later this year. “Some people say to me, ‘don’t create competition for yourself,’” Lau says. “But we have to make the community bigger for the future.”", "tags": ["artist", "neon", "heritage", "hong", "kong", "alive"]},
{"content": "Editor’s Note: In we look at the power of a single photograph, chronicling stories about how both modern and historical images have been made. Depicting endless rows of uniformed workers, Edward Burtynsky’s of mid-2000s Chinese factories spoke to the seemingly inexhaustible human labor behind China’s economic miracle. Just two decades later, the photographer’s glimpse inside an electric car plant near Shanghai presents the opposite phenomenon: a complete of people. “This is a factory built by humans but run by robots,” Burtynsky said of the facility, which is owned by top Chinese automaker BYD, on a Zoom call. “I think it’s a foreshadowing of where our future is.” BYD is at the forefront of a technological revolution. Last year, the company’s annual revenues surpassed American rival Tesla’s as it delivered 4.27 million vehicles (the 1.76 million EVs it produced in 2024 was just short of Tesla’s 1.79 million, but the Chinese company also delivered around 2.5 million hybrid vehicles). Its success is, partly, down to price: BYD’s entry-level model, the Seagull, starts at around $10,000 in China, a fraction of the $32,000 Tesla charges for its least expensive offering, the Model 3. And this affordability is, partly, down to highly automated manufacturing. In 2023, Burtynsky was granted rare access to a BYD plant in Changzhou, a city about two hours’ drive from Shanghai. He obtained permission through the personal connections of British architect Sir Norman Foster, who wanted a cover image for Domus, a magazine he was guest-editing about the future of various industries, including transportation. The car giant was, Burtynsky said, “very sensitive” about what he was allowed to document. But he believes he is the first independent photographer to be granted access to one of the company’s factories. “The humans are really just there to maintain the robots and keep the programs running clean,” he said of the secretive facility, referencing so-called “dark factories,” which are so devoid of human workers they can operate without lights. “Of course, corporations want that. There are no unions, there’s no sick pay and, as long as there’s electricity being fed to (the machines), they can work 24/7.” The standout image from Burtynsky’s visit, simply titled “BYD Manufacturing Facility #1,” paints a complex picture — not only of rapid change in China but of the ripple effects being felt in supply chains and labor markets around the world. The image’s “central character,” as the Canadian photographer put it, is an unfinished vehicle on a production line. Columns and beams around it repeat and recede to a vanishing point, producing a mesmerizing symmetry. The factory possessed a “cathedral-esque” quality, he said. In a sense, though, the photo is the last chapter in a story unfolding thousands of miles away. The image is part of a wider body of work, called “ ” exploring what Burtynsky considers to be the “next stage of globalization.” Currently on show at Hong Kong’s Flowers Gallery, the series contrasts BYD’s spotless factory with Chinese-owned rail crossings, warehouses and apparel factories in African countries including Ethiopia. Taken together, they depict what the photographer called China’s “complete vertical integration, from supply chain to finished product.” In other words, the human labor he saw in the mid-2000s hasn’t gone — it’s been offshored. And BYD, which is reported to have purchased lithium mines (for battery production) and mineral rights in countries , typifies the model, he said. “They have literally secured their complete supply chain,” he said. Burtynsky is best known for aerial shots of dramatic landscapes scarred by agriculture and industry, from copper mines to salt pans. Though his images often portray human overexploitation, he considers them to be “fairly neutral.” “I do it in a sort of deadpan aesthetic,” he said of his photographic style. “I don’t try to lean the viewer one way or the other, in terms of ‘This is bad’ or ‘This is good.’ I’m not trying to manipulate you.” His photos almost always contain some moral ambiguity. “Without copper,” he offered, illustrating the tradeoff between environmental degradation and human progress, “I couldn’t be having this conversation with you.” His depiction of BYD’s operations — and automation at large — is arguably even more paradoxical. Car manufacturing may be resource-heavy but electric vehicles could help end our dependance on fossil fuels, making the factories a symbol of environmental recovery, not damage. What’s more, China may not mourn the loss of jobs that Burtynsky described as “dehumanizing.” And he would know: Long before taking up photography full time, he worked at factories owned by car companies General Motors and Ford. “You feel like you’re part of the machine,” he recalled. “You’re just being used for your human energy because they haven’t (yet) found a machine that can do what you’re doing.” The enclosed mechanical worlds of his factory photos also differ from his large-scale landscapes, where nature provides the sense of scale. But what unites all of Burtynsky’s work is his attempt to evoke a “sense of wonder.” “I’m always trying to point my camera into worlds that we’re not all that familiar with, that (invite) the kind of scrutiny that a big, large format print can give you,” he added. “You can jump in and look at the small grease stain on the floor, or some splash of oil on the side of a wall in this pristine plant. You can see these little bits of everyday noise that take it to a more grounded, humanistic level.”", "tags": ["factory", "—", "beauty", "ev", "surreal", "humans", "chinese"]},
{"content": "Suspected Chinese government operatives asked to help write proposal for a tool to conduct large-scale surveillance and to help promote another that allegedly scans social media accounts for “extremist speech,” ChatGPT-maker OpenAI said in a report published Tuesday. The report sounds the alarm about how a highly coveted artificial intelligence technology can be used to try to make repression more efficient and provides “a rare snapshot into the broader world of authoritarian abuses of AI,” OpenAI said. The US and China are in an open contest for supremacy in AI technology, each investing billions of dollars in new capabilities. But the new report shows how AI is often used by suspected state actors to carry out relatively mundane tasks, like crunching data or making language more polished, rather any startling new technological achievement. “There’s a push within the People’s Republic of China to get better at using artificial intelligence for large-scale things like surveillance and monitoring,” Ben Nimmo, principal investigator at OpenAI, told CNN. “It’s not last year that the Chinese Communist Party started surveilling its own population. But now they’ve heard of AI and they’re thinking, oh maybe we can use this to get a little bit better.” In one case, a ChatGPT user “likely connected to a [Chinese] government entity” asked the AI model to help write a proposal for a tool that analyzes the travel movements and police records of the Uyghur minority and other “high-risk” people, according to the OpenAI report. The US State Department in the first Trump administration accused the Chinese government of genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims, a that Beijing vehemently denies. Another Chinese-speaking user asked ChatGPT for help designing “promotional materials” for a tool that purportedly scans X, Facebook and other social media platforms for political and religious content, the report said. OpenAI said it banned both users. AI is one of the most high-stakes areas of competition between the US and China, the world’s two superpowers. Chinese firm DeepSeek US officials and investors in January when it presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities but operates at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s model. That same month, President Donald Trump touted a by private firms to invest up to $500 million in AI infrastructure. Asked about OpenAI’s findings, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, said: “We oppose groundless attacks and slanders against China.” China is “rapidly building an AI governance system with distinct national characteristics,” Liu’s statement continued. “This approach emphasizes a balance between development and security, featuring innovation, security and inclusiveness. The government has introduced major policy plans and ethical guidelines, as well as laws and regulations on algorithmic services, generative AI, and data security.” The OpenAI report includes several other examples of just how commonplace AI is in the daily operations of state-backed and criminal hackers, along with other scammers. Suspected Russian, North Korean and Chinese hackers have all used ChatGPT to perform tasks like refining their coding or make the phishing links they send to targets more plausible. One way state actors are using AI is to improve in areas where they had weaknesses in the past. For instance, Chinese and Russian state actors have often struggled to avoid basic language errors in influence operations on social media. “Adversaries are using AI to refine existing tradecraft, not to invent new kinds of cyberattacks,” Michael Flossman, another security expert with OpenAI, told reporters. Meanwhile, scammers very likely based in the Southeast Asian country of Myanmar have used OpenAI’s models for a range of business tasks, from managing financial accounts to researching criminal penalties for online scams, according to the company. But an increasing number of would-be victims are using ChatGPT to spot scams before they are victimized. OpenAI estimates that ChatGPT is “being used to identify scams up to three times more often than it is being used for scams.” CNN asked OpenAI if it was aware of US military or intelligence agencies using ChatGPT for hacking operations. The company did not directly answer the question, instead referring CNN to OpenAI’s of using AI in support of democracy. US Cyber Command, the military’s offensive and defensive cyber unit, has made clear that it will use AI tools to support its mission. An “AI roadmap” approved by the command pledges to “accelerate adoption and scale capabilities” in artificial intelligence, according to a summary of the roadmap the command provided to CNN. Cyber Command is still exploring how to use AI in offensive operations, including how to use it to build capabilities to exploit software vulnerabilities in equipment used by foreign targets, former command officials told CNN.", "tags": ["surveillance", "proposals", "chinese", "openai", "chatgpt", "mass", "government"]},
{"content": "Suspected Chinese government-backed hackers have breached computer systems of US law firm , which has represented some of America’s most powerful politicians, as part of a larger spying campaign against multiple law firms, according to a letter the firm sent clients and a source familiar with the hack. The cyber intrusions have hit the email accounts of select attorneys at these law firms, as Beijing continues a broader effort to gather intelligence to support its multi-front competition with the US on issues ranging from national security to trade, multiple sources have told CNN. The hackers in this case used a previously unknown software flaw, coveted by spies because it allows for stealth, to access Williams & Connolly’s computer network, said the letter sent to clients this week and reviewed by CNN. The letter did not name the hackers responsible, but the source familiar with the hack told CNN that Beijing was the prime suspect. “Given the nature of the threat actor, we have no reason to believe that the data will be disclosed or used publicly,” the letter said, in a hint that the intruder was focused on espionage rather than extortion. CNN has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC for comment. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the embassy, told CNN in response to a separate last month: “China firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks and cybercrime.” It was not immediately clear which Williams & Connolly attorneys or clients were affected by the hack. Williams & Connolly is known for its politically influential clientele and a storied bench of courtroom lawyers. The firm has represented Bill and Hillary Clinton; corporate clients, including tech, health care and media companies; and white-collar criminal defendants like Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. A Williams & Connolly spokesperson declined to answer questions on who was responsible for the hack. The hackers are “believed to be affiliated with a nation-state actor responsible for recent attacks on a number of law firms and companies,” Williams & Connolly said in a statement to CNN. “We have taken steps to block the threat actor, and there is now no evidence of any unauthorized traffic on our network.” Another prominent US law firm hit by suspected Chinese hackers is Wiley Rein, CNN in July. With clients that span the Fortune 500, Wiley Rein is a powerful player in helping US companies and the government navigate the trade war with China. The suspected Chinese hackers have been rampant in recent weeks, also hitting the cloud-computing firms that numerous American companies rely on to store key data, experts at Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant CNN. In a sign of how important China’s hacking army is in the race for tech supremacy, the hackers have also stolen US tech firms’ proprietary software and used it to find new vulnerabilities to burrow deeper into networks, according to Mandiant. The Chinese government routinely denies allegations that it conducts hacking operations, often pointing to alleged US operations targeting Chinese entities and accusing Washington of a “double standard.” At any given time, the FBI has multiple investigations open into China’s elite hacking teams, which US officials consider the biggest state-backed cyber threat to American interests. CNN has requested comment from the FBI. “Law firms are prime targets for nation-state threat actors because of the complex, high-stakes issues they handle,” said Sean Koessel, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Volexity, which has investigated Chinese digital spying campaigns. “Intellectual property, emerging technologies, international trade, sanctions, public policy, to name a few,” Koessel told CNN. “In short, they hold a wealth of sensitive, non-public information that can offer significant strategic advantage.”", "tags": ["clients", "firm", "political", "spree", "law", "major", "hacked"]},

{"content": "Nike on Tuesday reported a surprise rise in first-quarter revenue and beat profit expectations as the storied sportswear brand’s turnaround effort gained traction despite weakness in China and tariffs pressuring margins. Nike shares rose more than 3% on Wednesday after the company also managed to clear some of its bloated inventory and wholesale revenues returned to growth in a sign of early success for CEO Elliott Hill’s plan to get Nike back to its former glory. Executives warned the recovery was still a way off. Nike now expects tariffs to cost it about $1.5 billion this year, compared with the . The sportswear brand makes nearly all its shoes in countries such as Vietnam that have been hit with steep duties under President Donald Trump. CEO Hill, a Nike veteran, took the reins last year and has vowed to refocus the brand around core sports like running following a string of weak quarters, and produce the kind of cutting-edge products Nike was known for. “We’re also realistic that we are turning our business around in the face of a cautious consumer tariffs uncertainty and teams that are still settling into this sports offense,” Hill said on a post-earnings call. In the company’s earnings statement, Hill admitted Nike still had “work ahead to get all sports, geographies, and channels on a similar path.” Nike forecast second-quarter revenue to fall in the low-single digits, compared with estimates of a 3.1% drop. It expects its struggling wholesale business to record growth for fiscal 2026 as well. China, Nike’s third-largest market, has been a particular problem, and executives said recovery there would take longer. The country accounted for 15% of overall sales in fiscal 2025. Sales in Greater China fell for the fifth straight quarter for the three months ended August 31 as Nike struggled to drum up demand in the face of stiff competition from domestic brands including Anta and Li-Ning. The company has also lost market share to younger rivals such as On and Deckers’ Hoka. Hill said Nike sent U.S. basketball stars LeBron James and Ja Morant to China recently as ambassadors, adding that he expects sports like running and basketball to drive growth in the region. “Nike beat the low bar set for EPS and showed some wholesale strength, but the underlying fundamentals are still shaky.

{"content": "In an escalating international dispute, Israel launched a series of diplomatic attacks against several of its Western allies as they prepare to recognize a Palestinian state next month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent two strongly worded letters to the leaders of France and Australia, accusing both men of fueling antisemitism with their decision to recognize a state of Palestine. In both letters, Netanyahu cited antisemitic and anti-Israel incidents that occurred in recent months, linking them to the governments’ positions on the Gaza war and Palestinian statehood. “Your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on this antisemitic fire”, Netanyahu wrote in a letter obtained by CNN to French President Emanuel Macron on Tuesday. “It is not diplomacy, it is appeasement. It rewards Hamas terror, hardens Hamas’s refusal to free the hostages, emboldens those who menace French Jews and encourages the Jew-hatred now stalking your streets.” The acrimonious letter drew a sharp rebuke from the Elysee Palace, which noted that Macron first learned of the Israeli letter through the press before receiving it through diplomatic channels. France “protects and will always protect its compatriots of the Jewish faith,” the Elysee Palace said in a statement. “These times demand seriousness and responsibility, not confusion and manipulation.” The tensions are a sign of the growing gulf between Netanyahu and his Western allies – many of whom have become increasingly critical of Israel’s war in Gaza, which has destroyed vast swathes of the territory and led to a worsening humanitarian crisis there. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon last week said Netanyahu had while Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told the Jyllands-Posten newspaper that “Netanyahu is now a problem in himself.” Earlier Tuesday, the Israeli prime minister also castigated Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, calling him a “weak politician,” after his government cancelled the visa of a far-right lawmaker from Netanyahu’s governing coalition. Australia and France are two of the to announce plans to recognize a State of Palestine. Canada and Portugal have also announced similar intentions. Next month, they will join more than 140 other countries that already recognize Palestinian statehood. The United Kingdom has conditionally said it will recognize a Palestinian state if Israel does not meet criteria that includes agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza. Netanyahu set a deadline for the leaders of Australia and France to take action against the “cancer” of antisemitism, calling on them “to act” before the Jewish New Year on September 23. The date coincides with the opening of the United Nations General Assembly’s high-level debate where the countries are expected to recognize a Palestinian state. France says the move is intended to revive the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and bring peace to the region, but Israel and the US have slammed the initiative, calling it a reward for Hamas terror that will only set back efforts for peace. Israel’s tensions with Australia have likewise worsened since Canberra announced its intention to recognize a Palestinian state, following its imposition of sanctions on Israeli far right ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir in June. The crisis deepened this week after Australian Home affairs Minister Tony Burke denied an entry visa to another far-right Israeli politician, Simcha Rothman. In response, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar revoked the residence visas of Australian representatives in the Palestinian Authority and instructed Israel’s embassy in Canberra to scrutinize every official Australian request for a visa to Israel. Netanyahu later attacked Australian Prime Minister Albanese on social media, saying, “History will remember Albanese for what he is: A weak politician who betrayed Israel and abandoned Australia’s Jews.” Albanese, speaking to local reporters on Wednesday, said he did not “take it personally.” He said, “I treat leaders of other countries with respect, and I engage with them in a diplomatic way.” Burke rebutted Netanyahu’s “weak” accusation, telling public broadcaster the ABC that “strength is not measured by how many people you can blow up or how many children you can leave hungry.”", "tags": ["recognition", "statehood", "launches", "attacks", "palestinian", "diplomatic", "allies"]},
{"content": "A postman has been hailed a hero for performing an extraordinary act perhaps only fully appreciated by people who dry their bed sheets outside in the sun. Gurpreet Singh was caught on a homeowner’s security camera making a delivery to a suburban address in Logan, south of Brisbane, Australia last Thursday. Instead of throwing the package towards the door, as some less professional delivery drivers might be tempted to do, Singh is seen taking the resident’s sheets off the clothesline and putting them under cover. It had started raining. Homeowner Verrity Wandel was so astonished she posted the video to social media this week with the words: “This is 1 in a million. I thought I was coming home to find my wash soaking wet but NO.” On social media, where complaints about dodgy deliveries are a more common occurrence, Singh’s thoughtful act went viral. The story was picked up by media in India, where one outlet dubbed Singh As their online fame spread, Singh and Wandel appeared on breakfast television in Australia, where Wandel walked viewers through the events of the day. “I just had visions of my washing being wrapped round and round the line, or embedded in the garden, and I drove in and there was no washing on the line. And I thought, that’s odd,” she told CNN affiliate 9 News. Asked why he did it, Singh, who seemed genuinely bewildered by the attention, said he wondered “whether I can do it or not” then did it anyway.  It took “one minute,” he said. As a member of Brisbane’s Sikh community, Singh’s a familiar face at the local temple and he’s known to perform acts of service in line with his Sikh faith, one community member told CNN. “When I saw this act, I knew that he wasn’t doing it for any publicity or anything, that’s just who he is,” said Tejinder Singh. Wandel denied suggestions made by one radio host that she was part of an elaborate marketing ploy on behalf of government-owned Australia Post. Run as a commercial operation, Australia Post has struggled with losses in recent years, amid a decline in letter-sending and competition from delivery companies. Of Singh, Australia Post said it’d been inundated by requests for information about the delivery driver, who’d worked as a contractor for four years.  “He tries to help customers out where he can,” a spokesperson said. While Wandel’s original post attracted thousands of comments in praise of Singh, a series of abusive comments prompted her to post a follow-up video. “We should be a kinder world,” she said in the video. “If you have the opportunity to do a totally selfless act, do it, don’t think about it.

{"content": "A shark hunt is underway off Australia’s east coast after a father was killed in a “freak” attack at a Sydney beach. Mercury Psillakis was mauled by what police said was at Long Reef Beach on Saturday. The 57-year-old was attacked while surfing about 100 meters offshore, in the city’s second fatal shark incident since 1963. Now, drone operators are scanning the water for any sign of further shark activity at the beach, which remains closed, according to CNN affiliate 9News. Emergency services rushed to the beach shortly after 10 a.m., following reports of a man suffering critical injuries. He was brought to shore and pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. Witnesses described a chaotic scene as the shark’s fin surfaced. “There was a guy screaming ‘I don’t want to get bitten, I don’t want to get bitten, don’t bite me,’ and I saw the dorsal fin of the shark come up and it was huge,” Mark Morgenthal told CNN affiliate Sky News Australia. “Then I saw the tail fin come up and start kicking, and the distance between the dorsal fin and the tail fin looked to be about four meters, so it actually looked like a six-meter shark.” Psillakis disappeared under the water with his surfboard and lost several limbs in the attack, New South Wales (NSW) Police Inspector Stuart Thomson told reporters at a press conference on Saturday. “His (friends) managed to make it back to the beach safely and a short time later his body was found floating in the surf and a couple of other people went out and recovered it,” Thomson said. “Attempts to save his life were unsuccessful.” Psillakis, an experienced surfer who leaves behind a wife and young daughter, was well known in the Northern Beaches community for selling rare exotic plants, frequently showcasing his finds on local Facebook groups. Police and shark biologists are analyzing Psillakis’s body and fragments of his surfboard, as well as speaking with witnesses, to determine the shark species, 9News added. Drone operators are scanning the water for potential shark activity. Locals are urged to avoid beaches in the area as lifeguards keep people from entering the water. Northern Beaches Police Area Commander John Duncan told local media the attack was a “freak incident that happens very, very rarely.” Shark attacks in Sydney are exceptionally rare, with only one other fatality in the past 60 years. Diving instructor Simon Nellist was killed by a great white while swimming off Little Bay Beach in 2022. Before that, the last deadly incident was in 1963, when actress Marcia Hathaway was fatally mauled by a bull shark in Middle Harbour’s shallow waters. Shark nets were installed across 51 beaches in NSW, for the season starting  September 1, across 51 beaches stretching around 140 miles from Newcastle to Wollongong, 9News reports. This is implemented each year, throughout the state’s spring and summer period, with sharks being more common in warmer months.

{"content": "Erin Patterson, the Australian woman ith a meal of death cap mushrooms baked in a Beef Wellington lunch, will be sentenced on Monday morning after she was found guilty of three counts of murder and the attempted murder of the lone survivor. The extraordinary case has attracted international attention and, in a very rare instance, the sentencing will be livestreamed from the Victoria Supreme Court. Justice Christopher Beale, who will sentence Patterson, said he decided to allow camera access due to “intense public interest in the case.” A 12-member jury reached the verdict in July after around six days of deliberation following a 10-week trial in Morwell, a tiny town about an hour’s drive from the suburban dining room in Leongatha, Victoria, where the lethal lunch was served in July 2023. Dozens of media crews raced to the court when it was announced the jury had reached a verdict in the case that has captivated audiences worldwide and spawned four podcasts dedicated to unpacking each day’s evidence. During weeks of testimony, Patterson was accused of deliberately tainting the lunch with death cap mushrooms, highly toxic fungi that she picked after seeing their location posted on a public website. In the days after, her former parents-in-law, Don and Gail Patterson, died along with Gail’s sister Heather Wilkinson. Heather’s husband Ian, their local pastor, survived after a weekslong stay in hospital. Her defense lawyers had argued the deaths were a “terrible accident” that occurred when Patterson tried to improve the taste of the meal, and that she repeatedly lied to police out of panic when she realized she may have added foraged mushrooms to the mix. Patterson sat in court, listening as prosecutors called witness after witness, whose testimony, they alleged, told a compelling story of a triple murder that the jury ultimately found satisfied the legal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. Under Australian law, none of the jurors can be publicly identified, and they’re prohibited from disclosing jury room deliberations even after the trial ends. It will never be known which pieces of evidence influenced each juror’s decision, but all 12 were required to agree on the verdict. The agreed facts were that Patterson asked five people to lunch on July 29, 2023, including her estranged husband Simon Patterson, who pulled out the day before. Within hours of the meal, the four lunch guests – Simon’s parents Don and Gail, and his aunt and uncle, Heather and Ian Wilkinson – became ill with vomiting and diarrhea. They went to hospital where they were placed in induced comas as doctors tried to save them. Gail and Heather died on August 4 from multiorgan failure, followed by Don on August 5, after he failed to respond to a liver transplant. Ian Wilkinson survived and was finally discharged from hospital in late September, after almost two months of intensive treatment. Death cap mushrooms contain amanita toxins that prevent the production of proteins in liver cells, leading to cell death and possible liver failure from about two days after ingestion. Native to Europe, the lethal mushrooms have been found growing in several Australian states, and around the time of the lunch, they had been seen within a short drive of Patterson’s home in rural Victoria. During the trial, the prosecution argued that Patterson had the opportunity to pick lethal mushrooms after seeing their location posted on the citizen science iNaturalist website. The guilty verdict suggests the jury accepted the prosecution’s argument that she likely traveled to two sites in April and May 2023, and deliberately picked the mushrooms used in the meal. Prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC alleged that “four calculated deceptions” were at the heart of the case. “The first deception was the fabricated cancer claim she used as a pretence for the lunch invitation,” she said. “The second deception was the lethal doses of poison the accused secreted in the homecooked beef Wellingtons. The third deception was her attempts to make it seem that she also suffered death cap mushroom poisoning and the fourth deception, the sustained cover-up she embarked upon to conceal the truth.” Patterson admitted that on April 28 – the same day as cellphone signals put her in the vicinity of death cap mushrooms – she bought a dehydrator that she later dumped at a waste recycling center on August 2, as her guests lay in hospital. It had her fingerprints on it and contained remnants of death cap mushrooms. The prosecution alleged that Patterson faked illness in the days after serving the lunch and tried to cover her tracks by disposing of the dehydrator and factory resetting her devices to delete evidence. Patterson’s defense lawyer Colin Mandy SC accused the prosecution of being selective with the evidence and pushing “four ridiculous, convoluted propositions.” The first was that Patterson would do this “without any motive,” Mandy said. He said there were several reasons why Patterson would not want to kill her guests. She had no money issues, lived in a big house, and had almost full-time custody of her two young children, who were very close to their grandparents, he said. The prosecution did not have to prove motive. Rogers accused Patterson of having two faces: One she showed the world that suggested she had a good relationship with the Pattersons, and a hidden face she showed only her Facebook friends that suggested she wanted “nothing to do with them.” In Facebook messages sent in December 2022, Patterson had expressed anger and frustration over Don and Gail’s reluctance to get involved in their son’s marriage breakdown. “I’m sick of this shit I want nothing to do with them,” she wrote. “I thought his parents would want him to do the right thing but it seems their concern about not wanting to feel uncomfortable and not wanting to get involved in their son’s personal matters are overriding that so f*** em.” And another message read: “This family I swear to f***ing god.” During eight days of testimony including cross-examination, Patterson consistently pleaded her innocence, claiming she inadvertently added foraged mushrooms to the meal. In his directions to the jury, Justice Christopher Beale said that Patterson’s admission that she told lies and disposed of evidence must not cause them to be prejudiced against her. “This is a court of law, not a court of morals,” he said. “The issue is not whether she is in some sense responsible for the tragic consequences of the lunch, but whether the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that she is criminally responsible for those consequences,” he said. The jury found that Patterson had intended to kill all four lunch guests and lied repeatedly on the stand to claim she didn’t.", "tags": ["wellington", "lunch", "guilty", "woman", "australian", "guests", "beef"]},
{"content": "A beach in Melbourne, Australia has been bathed in an “ethereal glow” at nighttime this week thanks to bioluminescent algae adding a shimmering, electric blue hue . Richard Pensak first saw the algae — called and sometimes referred to as “sea sparkle” — on Sunday morning at St. Kilda Beach, about 4 miles from the center of Melbourne, a city in southeastern Australia. By day, the algae bloom appears as a bright pinkish-orange cloud, said Pensak, a marine ecologist and a coordinator at Earthcare St Kilda, a local environmental group. It’s at night when it transforms into a “stunning light display” lending the beach a “magical, ethereal glow,” he told CNN. There are reports the algae has spread along the north-western coast of Melbourne, Pensak added. The phenomenon is caused by a chemical reaction the algae produce when they are agitated or disturbed — if they are grabbed by a predator, for example, or experience a surge of movement from a wave or swimmer. It “is likely a defence mechanism,” Pensak said, as the bioluminescence can startle predators or attract larger predators to target those consuming the algae. The algae are not , but they can be hazardous to fish due to their high and their . Extensive blooms off the Indian coast have been linked to fisheries declines. These sparkling algal blooms are a natural phenomenon, but their abundance and length have increased rapidly since the 1990s, Pensak said. Research has linked more frequent and intense blooms to warming oceans. As the water heats up, ocean layers mix less, which in turn makes it harder for nutrients to mix properly, creating conditions that favor the algae, Pensak said. “It can be a sign of an unhealthy ocean,” he added. Still, the algae has proved to be an extremely popular attraction. Hundreds of people have visited St. Kilda to experience it, Pensak said. “Being a city beach, we often don’t get to see phenomena like this.”", "tags": ["electric", "bioluminescent", "algae", "australian", "beach", "ethereal", "blue", "glow"]},
{"content": "Three Scottish brothers have made history by completing the fastest unsupported non-stop row across the Pacific Ocean - the world’s largest ocean - with 139 days at sea. Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan Maclean rowed 9,000 miles from Peru to Australia, also becoming the first team on record to successfully row across from South America. Surviving on freshly caught fish and freeze-dried meals, they overcame seasickness, dwindling food supplies and tropical storms, including one incident in which Lachlan was swept overboard by a towering wave in the night. On Saturday, the Edinburgh trio triumphantly stepped back onto land after four-and-a-half months of aboard their self-built, F1-inspired carbon fiber boat. In doing so, they surpassed the previous time record crossing set by Russian Fedor Konyukhov, who rowed solo from Chile to Australia in 2014. Arriving just before midday, the brothers celebrated by playing the bagpipes and waving Scottish, Australian and UK flags as they were greeted by friends and family including their mother Sheila. “We’ve still got our sea legs, so yeah, wobbling all over the place to be honest, but very happy to be ashore,” Ewan told Australia’s public broadcaster ABC, describing the experience as “pretty overwhelming.” Hours before, Ewan had uploaded a video on Instagram sending a message to the marina. “Do you have pizza and beer? I repeat, do you have pizza and beer? Over.” Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan set off from Peru’s capital Lima in mid-April, with the initial goal of reaching Sydney by August 2. But they rerouted to Cairns due to bad weather. “The last couple of weeks have been really hard,” Jamie told ABC. “Our expectations being crushed when we thought we were going to arrive and then getting hit by storm after storm, just getting knocked back, getting thrown north.” It followed Lachlan’s terrifying man-overboard incident during a night shift when Ewan managed to rescue him. “A side-on wave came in out of nowhere. I had like a couple of seconds to react and it just hit me,” Lachlan told ABC. “Took me right off my feet. I kind of hit the life lines on the starboard side, basically did like a backwards somersault into the water.” Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan believe their familial bond was pivotal in their mission. Despite the extreme challenges, they were able to stay positive, often finding moments of joy in the harshest of times. “We are able to speak very directly to one another,” Jamie said previously. “Good communication has been key to this journey.” Their boat, named Rose Emily in honor of their sister who was lost during pregnancy, is believed to be the fastest and lightest ocean rowing boat ever built, created with ocean rowing legend Mark Slats. The Macleans embarked on the ocean crossing in pursuit of both a world record and the goal of raising £1m to fund clean water projects in Madagascar. In 2020, they looked for a way to support charities fighting for clean drinking water around the world and thought of the potential impact of undertaking a big physical challenge. They made the bold decision to row across the Atlantic Ocean, achieving three world records in the process. They completed the 3,000-mile journey in just 35 days, becoming the first trio of brothers to row any ocean together and the youngest and fastest trio to cross from the Canary Islands to Antigua. Once back on dry land, they realized their mission for clean water was not over and concluded that the best way to promote the cause was to go one step further and “take on the biggest body of water on the planet,” they told to on their 101st day at sea. Their family-run, non-profit organization, The Maclean Foundation, works to secure clean water for communities through pairing up with partner organizations in Madagascar to build boreholes. The Pacific challenge aims to raise awareness and funding to build boreholes for the whole of the Ambohimanarina municipality in Madagascar, where currently only 14% of the population has access to safe, clean drinking water. The aim for the brothers is to provide clean water for over 40,000 people. “We want to have a positive impact on other people, that is ultimately what this journey is about,” Ewan previously told CNN. “Seeing the donations come in and the messages of support have really helped us through some pretty bleak times.” The Maclean’s mission continues, so far having raised £850,859 ($1.15 million) of their £1 million ($1.35 million) target for their latest ocean crossing.", "tags": ["scottish", "beer", "record", "pizza", "complete", "day", "pacific", "row", "land", "brothers"]},

The government on Saturday said it would spend A$12 billion ($8 billion) to upgrade facilities at the Henderson shipyard near Perth, as part of a 20-year plan to transform it into the maintenance hub for its AUKUS submarine fleet. The AUKUS pact, agreed upon by Australia, Britain and the US in 2021, aims to provide Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines from the next decade to counter China’s ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region. President Donald Trump’s administration is undertaking a of the pact. When asked on Sunday if the US would be able to use dry docks at the facility for its nuclear-powered submarines, Marles said “this is an AUKUS facility and so I would expect so.” “This is about being able to sustain and maintain Australia’s future submarines but it is very much a facility that is being built in the context of AUKUS,” he told Australian Broadcasting Corporation television. “I would expect that in the future this would be available to the US.” The center-left Labor government made an initial investment of A$127 million last year to upgrade facilities at the shipyard, which will also build the new landing craft for the Australian army and the new general-purpose frigates for the navy, supporting around 10,000 local jobs.

Researchers from the University of the Sunshine Coast spent more than 10 years developing a single-dose vaccine to protect the famed Australian marsupial from the effects of chlamydia, which include urinary tract infections, infertility, blindness and death, the university said in a statement Wednesday. Chlamydia is responsible for half of koala deaths in the country’s wild populations, which are predominantly found in the eucalyptus forests along Australia’s eastern coast. “Some individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in South East Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50 percent and in some cases can reach as high as 70 percent,” Peter Timms, professor of microbiology at UniSC’s Centre for Bioinnovation, said in a Often used as an emblem of Australian culture, the fluffy gray marsupials can only be found in Australia, and are considered endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.

In humans, chlamydia is a bacterial that can cause infertility if left untreated. The disease spreads in koala populations through reproduction and social behavior connected to mating.

{"content": "Britain, Canada and Australia announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine on Sunday, in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage. The three – all strong allies of Israel for decades – also expressed deep frustration at the lack of progress towards a two-state solution. Later on Sunday, Portugal announced that it too had formally recognized a Palestinian state, adding that a two-state solution was the “only path to a just and lasting peace.” France and several other countries are expected to follow suit at the United Nations General Assembly this week, deepening Israel’s isolation and putting them at odds with Israel’s key partner, the United States. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that “there will be no Palestinian state.” “I have a clear message to those leaders recognizing a Palestinian state after the horrific massacre of October 7th: you are giving a massive prize to terror,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday. “The response to the latest attempt to force a terror state upon us in the heart of our land will be given after my return from the United States. Wait for it,” Netanyahu added. Israel’s President Isaac Herzog added to this criticism, saying the move will “not help one Palestinian, it won’t help free one hostage, and it will not help us reach any settlement between Israelis and Palestinians.” “This is a sad day for those who seek true peace,” Herzog said in a post on X. More than of the UN already recognize Palestine, a number that has grown in the face of mounting alarm over Israel’s offensive in . In the first of a series of apparently coordinated announcements Sunday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said on X his country “recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the state of Palestine and the State of Israel.” “The Palestinian Authority has renounced violence, has recognized Israel and is committed to the two-state solution,” a senior Canadian government official told CNN shortly before the announcement. “We are recognizing the State of Palestine in order to empower those who seek peaceful coexistence and marginalize Hamas.” Carney had said in July that his country would recognize the State of Palestine at the UNGA, drawing immediate condemnation from Israeli officials and the US, with President Donald Trump saying it could hurt Canada in trade talks. The announcement by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes good on his in July to recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel met certain conditions, which included agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to the prospect of a two-state solution. Since Starmer issued his ultimatum, Israel has moved to take control of Gaza City and expand Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and has repeated its opposition to a two-state solution. Netanyahu on Sunday said that Israel has “doubled Jewish settlement” in the occupied West Bank, adding “we will continue on this path.” “In the face of growing horror in the Middle East, we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace,” Starmer said in a video address. Britain’s Foreign Office travel advice webpage was updated on Sunday to reflect Starmer’s announcement, changing mentions of the “Occupied Palestinian Territories” to “Palestine.” French President was the prime mover in July, calling for countries to join France in announcing their recognition at UNGA. In an interview with CBS News aired on Sunday, Macron confirmed France’s intention to recognize a Palestinian state on Monday, while stating that the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza will be a requirement “before opening, for instance, an embassy in Palestine.” Belgium, Luxembourg and San Marino are among other governments planning to recognize a Palestinian state this week. Israel has furiously condemned the moves, saying they will reward and embolden Hamas for its October 7, 2023, terror attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another roughly 250 taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 Palestinian people, according to the territory’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. A growing number of international scholars and bodies say Israel’s war , an accusation that the Israeli government has vehemently denied. Far-right members of the Israeli government responded to the announcements Sunday by urging Netanyahu to annex the occupied West Bank. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the UK’s announcement was an “important and necessary step towards achieving a just and lasting peace.” According to Abbas, the move would pave the way for the implementation of the two-state solution, “allowing the State of Palestine to live side by side with the State of Israel in security, peace, and good neighborliness.” Basem Naim, a senior member of Hamas’ political office, told CNN that today’s move by the UK, Canada and Australia is a “welcomed step,” but must be accompanied by “practical measures on the ground.” Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, a leading figure in Palestinian politics, said the move by several countries to recognize a Palestinian state signals “a sea change in the world,” and there are many “courses of action open to these states to stop the genocide & take punitive measures against Israel. The test lies in whether they will.” Despite the growing momentum to recognize Palestine, there are roadblocks to it becoming a full UN member. The path to become a full member requires at least nine of the 15 members of the Security Council to vote in favor, and none of the five permanent members – Britain, China, France, Russia and the US – to veto it. The US would be expected to wield its veto power if the issue came before the Security Council. Because China and Russia recognized a Palestinian state in 1988, the US may soon be left as the only permanent Security Council member not to recognize a Palestinian state, reinforcing how Washington increasingly stands as a bulwark between Israel and growing international isolation.

{"content": "Russia has agreed to help China equip and train an airborne battalion, according to leaked documents reviewed by a leading think tank, illustrating the ever-deepening military partnership between Beijing and Moscow. Russia in 2023 agreed to sell a suite of military equipment to China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), including assault vehicles, anti-tank guns, and airborne armored personnel carriers, according to documents leaked by the Black Moon hacktivist group and verified by the British think tank the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). The armored vehicles would be equipped with Chinese comms and command-and-control suites, and Russia would train a battalion of Chinese paratroopers to use them, according to the approximately 800 pages of contracts and additional materials reviewed by RUSI. Under the terms of the agreement, Russia would also transfer technologies to China, that will allow it to make similar weapons, RUSI’s review of the documents shows. The agreement, if fully implemented, would bolster China’s air maneuver capabilities, one of the few areas where Moscow’s military still has an edge over the PLA. And improving in that area could – according to RUSI experts – help China one day achieve its aim of taking Taiwan, the self-governing island of 23 million which Beijing claims as its territory. “Russia is equipping and training Chinese special forces groups to penetrate the territory of other countries without being noticed, offering offensive options against Taiwan, the Philippines and other island states in the region,” RUSI fellows Oleksandr V Danylyuk and Jack Watling The Philippines is one of many nations with which China has overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea. Vessels from both countries regularly clash in the region, as Beijing becomes more assertive in its claims. CNN has not independently reviewed the leaked documents, and it is not clear whether the deal has been fully implemented. CNN has reached out to China’s Ministry of National Defense and Russia’s defense ministry for comment. Russia and China have traded arms since the 1990s, but in the past decade their military partnership has become more robust as ties between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have warmed, raising alarm bells in Washington. Xi, Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month at a Chinese military parade, in an unprecedented show of solidarity against the US and its allies. Moscow and Beijing increasingly view their close relationship as critical to achieving their respective goals. Earlier this month, Putin said the bilateral relationship was at an as the two countries reportedly inked a long-stalled agreement to build a massive new pipeline to send natural gas to China via Mongolia. Moscow has increasingly turned to China to replace Europe as its major gas buyer, since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow and Bejing have also been in recent years, including joint naval patrols around Japan and air and sea patrols off Alaska. In August, they conducted their in the Pacific, according to reports in state-run media. China and Russia conducted 14 joint military drills in 2024, the most since the two countries started doing drills together in 2003, The greatest benefit of the 2023 deal for Beijing, according to the RUSI fellows, would be in the training of the airborne battalion, since Russia’s forces have combat experience in that area, while China’s do not. If China were to attack Taiwan, an air maneuver would likely be the most effective way to get key troops and equipment onto the island in the early stages of an operation - although any attempt to invade and hold the island would likely require a huge and very difficult amphibious assault by sea. According to the agreement, the training would be carried out partly in Russia and partly in China. Russian instructors would then train the Chinese airborne battalion at training grounds in China, preparing the soldiers for landing, fire control and maneuvering.", "tags": ["train", "tank", "chinese", "battalion", "air", "russia", "equip", "show", "documents"]},

It began to lose strength and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm in the early hours of Thursday morning, local time, but not before leaving a trail of damage – triggering landslides, flooding and huge waves in China’s Guangdong province, home to massive cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou. With the storm expected to keep moving westward on Thursday, some train services in southern China have been suspended, while the country’s central government has earmarked around $49 million for relief efforts, according to state media. Schools, factories and transport services were initially shut down in about a dozen cities, but some distant from the landfall location prepared to resume work as winds weakened. In Taiwan, at least 14 people died and 31 others were still missing Thursday after a natural dam holding back a recently formed lake collapsed a day earlier, unleashing 68 million tons of water and flooding the nearby Guangfu township. Officials had revised the death toll down on Thursday, saying there had been some double counting in earlier numbers provided. Videos from the town, in the mountainous eastern Hualien county, show a torrent of water rushing through the streets, with cars swept away and residents sheltering on higher floors as the lower levels of their homes become inundated. Debris from a landslide in July had formed the natural dam, and authorities had been warning for weeks the remote lake could overflow by October. At a news conference on Wednesday, officials said assessments showed it wasn’t feasible to dredge, siphon or otherwise remove the dam barrier - so they opted to monitor the situation instead. Before Ragasa hit, authorities said they had issued multiple warnings and evacuation advisories to residents who could be impacted if the lake overflowed. A large bridge in Hualien was also washed away by the rush of water following the collapse of the natural dam. Ragasa is expected to continue to deteriorate over China, bringing heavy rain, and ultimately dissipate over Vietnam on Friday. The Philippines, Taiwan and southern China experience , but the human-caused climate crisis has made storms more unpredictable and extreme. Illustrating this new reality, videos circulating on Chinese social media showed uprooted trees and shattered windows in Yangjiang, where Ragasa made landfall on Wednesday afternoon with the equivalent strength of a Category 3 hurricane. Further footage showed severe flooding in Zhuhai, a coastal city neighboring Macao. Residents of seaside high-rises were ordered to evacuate on Tuesday afternoon, according to state media, with many taking refuge with relatives, checking in to hotels or moving to temporary government shelters like school gyms. One longtime resident, who relocated with her family to a school gymnasium, told local outlet Hongxing News it was the first time in her three decades living in Zhuhai that she had ever been evacuated. A further 1.89 million people were evacuated from China’s southern Guangdong province by Tuesday night, ahead of the storm’s arrival, according to the provincial emergency management department. As the storm approached the international finance hub of Hong Kong early Wednesday, it brought lashing winds that felled trees and ripped scaffolding off buildings. Video circulating on social media showed storm surges shattering the glass doors of the ﻿Fullerton Ocean Park Hotel, a luxury seaside resort, with huge waves gushing into the lobby and sweeping people off their feet. In a statement to CNN, the hotel said no injuries were reported and that the government had “immediately” mobilized resources to respond. Photos and video from Macao showed waist-deep water flooding the streets of the tourism and gambling hub, often dubbed the most densely populated city on earth. Footage from Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, showed massive waves crashing into a coastal park Tuesday night, with winds reaching 181.44 kilometers per hour (112.4 mph). Though southern China is highly populated, with tens of millions potentially impacted by the storm, it’s also well prepared. Here, cities are frequently in storm paths and have developed sophisticated infrastructure to combat weather-related dangers – including a vast that has saved Hong Kong from floods that decades ago routinely cost lives and caused widespread destruction. This year has been particularly stormy. Hong Kong typically experiences about six typhoons annually, but Ragasa marks the ninth typhoon so far this year, according to the City University of Hong Kong. Climate change is making storms of this scale not only more common but more powerful too, according to Johnny Chan, an atmospheric scientist at the Asia-Pacific Typhoon Collaborative Research Centre. “Because of global warming, you will have more moisture in the atmosphere and (the) water temperature is also high, therefore … once the storm develops, it has more energy,” said Chan. He warned cities in Asia would need to continually update their building codes to handle stronger winds, higher sea levels and more intense typhoons. “Most of the building codes were designed based on the past data, but the past data would not be accurate anymore for the future,” he said. Cleanup efforts are now underway in the Philippines – where the typhoon had been the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane when it struck northern parts of the country on Monday. At least seven fishermen were killed after a boat overturned off the coast off Luzon on Monday, according to the state-run Philippine Information Agency. Another storm, called Opong, is now intensifying in the Philippines in the aftermath of Ragasa, and typhoon season still has many months left.

{"content": "A court in China has sentenced 11 people to death for their roles in a billion-dollar family-run criminal empire built on online scam and gambling operations in a remote border region of Myanmar, and for the deaths of workers who tried to escape. Eleven members and associates of the Ming crime family were sentenced to death on Monday by the Wenzhou Intermediate People’s Court in eastern China’s Zhejiang Province, according to a court statement. The Ming family is one of the so-called “four families” of northern Myanmar — mafia-like crime syndicates accused of running hundreds of compounds dealing in internet fraud, prostitution and drug production, and whose members hold prominent positions in the local government and militia aligned with Myanmar’s ruling junta. The family, headed by Ming Xuechang, had long been tied to an called Crouching Tiger Villa in Kokang, an autonomous region on Myanmar’s border with China. At their peak, the group had 10,000 people working to conduct scams and other crimes for them, Chinese broadcaster CCTV reported. Kokang’s capital Laukkaing was at the heart of the country’s multi-billion-dollar scam industry, where trafficked workers were used to defraud strangers with sophisticated online schemes. Cash from the illicit activities had transformed the impoverished border town into a glittering casino city. As the junta dragged its feet on shutting down the scam centers – a pressing security priority for Beijing – and after years of complaints by families of those trafficked to work in them on its southwestern border as well as growing international media reports, China launched a crackdown in 2023. That November, China issued arrest warrants for members of the family, accusing them of fraud, murder and trafficking and posted rewards of between $14,000 and $70,000 for their capture. Family head Ming Xuechang, who had also served as member of a Myanmar state parliament, later killed himself while in custody, Chinese state media reported at the time. His son, Ming Guoping who was a leader in the junta-aligned Kokang Border Guard Force, his daughter Ming Julan, and granddaughter Ming Zhenzhen were also arrested. Along with allied criminal groups, the syndicate’s crimes led to the deaths of 10 people who disobeyed the group’s management or tried to escape the compounds, according to the Chinese court’s statement. In one incident in October 2023, four people were killed when members of the group allegedly opened fire on people at a scam compound. In a report into the shooting, Chinese state media CCTV reported the group were transferring workers from the cyber fraud park under armed guard after being tipped off that police were planning a raid of the compound. Five other defendants were given suspended death sentences for two years, and 12 others were handed prison terms of between five and 24 years, the court statement said. Since 2015, the Ming family used its influence in the Kokang region to develop a number of compounds and recruit “financial backers” and armed protection to build a network of telecommunications fraud, casinos, drug trafficking and organized prostitution, the court said in its statement. More than is lost to scams in Southeast Asia by regional crime groups a year, according to the US Congress-founded United States Institute of Peace. In Myanmar, scam compounds have been shielded by corruption and lawlessness that has long saturated the country’s border regions. But the criminal syndicates and the armed groups hosting them have exploited four years of devastating civil war to expand their business. The Chinese crackdown that led to the arrest of the Ming family and others in Kokang came after a against the Myanmar military in October 2023. China had been publicly pushing the junta to crack down on cross-border crime targeting Chinese nationals. The rebels also cited the need to take out the massive scam operations as justification for their offensive – which analysts say China likely greenlit. They eventually forced the military and its allies from Laukkaing. Chinese authorities say more than 53,000 Chinese “suspects” – including trafficked victims – have been sent back to China from scam compounds in northern Myanmar. Highly publicized crackdowns against Myanmar’s scam centers have also taken place in further south in the country, following pressure from Chinese and Thai authorities. But experts and analysts the cyber fraud industry is rapidly expanding through illicit online marketplaces, with syndicates adopting cryptocurrency and investing in cutting-edge technological developments in artificial intelligence to move money more quickly, and make their scams more effective.

{"content": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday clearing the way for the to sell TikTok’s US assets to a consortium of mostly American investors. The order marks an important procedural step toward finalizing the TikTok sale, but the deal is not yet complete. Although both US and Chinese officials have signaled they are aligned on the deal’s framework, it will still likely require regulatory approvals from both countries. The full list of investors participating in the deal has not yet been released. However, during the signing event, Trump said Chinese leader Xi Jinping had green-lit the deal and expressed confidence that it would be completed. “I had a very good talk with President Xi,” Trump said, referring to a Friday phone call between the two leaders. “And we talked about TikTok and other things, but we talked about TikTok and he gave us the go-ahead” for the deal. Beijing has not publicly confirmed Xi’s approval, nor has it provided any update on the status of the deal since the latest round of trade talks with the US in Madrid last week, when Chinese officials said they had reached a “basic framework consensus” over TikTok. Thursday’s executive order states that the deal constitutes a qualified divestiture as required by the ban-or-sale law that passed with strong bipartisan consensus last year. The US law, which went into effect in January, bans the app unless parent company ByteDance divests approximately 80% of its US assets to non-Chinese investors. Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law. “I have determined that the proposed divestiture would allow the millions of Americans who enjoy TikTok every day to continue using it while also protecting national security,” the order states. It adds that the deal to transfer control of TikTok’s US assets will also apply to ByteDance’s other popular platforms, Lemon8 and CapCut. The president is also expected to extend the pause on enforcing the law by another 120 days so that paperwork and regulatory approvals for the deal can be completed, a senior White House official said Monday. Trump recently extended the pause until December 16 — meaning that if the deal is completed, TikTok’s assets likely won’t be formally transferred until next year. ByteDance is also expected to sign an agreement laying out the framework of the deal with one or more of the new investors this week. The deal will hand control of TikTok’s US operations, along with a copy of the algorithm, to the new US-based joint venture, according to the White House. That ownership group will have majority American investors — including Oracle and potentially private equity firm Silver Lake, Dell CEO Michael Dell and Lachlan Murdoch’s Fox Corp. — and be run by a majority American board of directors. ByteDance is expected to retain a stake no greater than 20%. Oracle will oversee the app’s algorithm, as well as data and privacy issues, according to the White House. Beijing has insisted that the deal must comply with Chinese laws and regulations, which have placed TikTok’s algorithm under export controls. Chinese officials and government advisors have that instead of selling the algorithm, ByteDance could license the technology to the new US joint venture after obtaining an export approval from the Chinese government. The new US-based joint venture will be valued around $14 billion, Vice President JD Vance said during Thursday’s executive order signing. The value of TikTok’s US assets had previously been pegged at anywhere between $20 billion and $100 billion, depending on whether the agreement included access to the app’s  algorithm. “We’re going to keep on working at it, but this deal really does mean that Americans can use TikTok, but actually use it with more confidence than they had in the past, because their data is going to be secure and it’s not going to be used as a propaganda weapon against our fellow citizens,” said Vance, who had been tasked with leading the deal negotiations. Major questions about the deal remain, including whether it will require American users to download a separate US TikTok app after the deal is complete. And while the deal will preserve access to the platform for its 170 million American users, some have already begun to raise concerns about TikTok’s algorithm — which determines what users see on the platform — being controlled by an investor group that includes at least some Trump allies. While Trump said on Thursday that he would love for TikTok’s algorithm to be “100% MAGA,” both he and Vance sought to assuage concerns that the app’s new ownership would promote a certain perspective on the platform. “If I could make it 100% MAGA, I would, but it’s not going to work out that way,” Trump said. “Everyone is going to be treated fairly, every group, every philosophy.” Vance added: “We want the business to make decisions about content based on the interest of the business and based on the interest of the users, and that’s what we think will happen.” Analysts say Chinese leaders are using an app that is low-priority on its trade negotiation agenda but cherished by the US president and millions of Americans as a bargaining chip to extract other, far more consequential concessions. The expected deal lays the groundwork for the first in-person meeting between Trump and Xi since Trump returned to office. The leaders discussed the TikTok deal in a call on Friday and are expected to meet next month at the APEC Summit in South Korea.", "tags": ["tiktok", "order", "executive", "deal", "complete"]},
{"content": "In the spring of 2024, Li Hongxing, who runs a social media ad agency, took on a client he believed to be a rising star in China’s electric vehicle market. A marketing veteran in the auto industry, Li went so far as to borrow to cover the cost of ads for Ji Yue, expecting payment later from the EV startup he thought had everything it needed to succeed: efficiency, growing sales, and deep-pocketed backers. But it didn’t. Within half a year, the carmaker collapsed, turning Li’s gamble into a nightmare, saddling him with debt of 40 million yuan ($5.6 million). “It was a feeling of sheer despair,” Li said. Ji Yue’s downfall is hardly unique in China’s auto industry, where hundreds of brands have gone under in a brutal race to the bottom over the past few years. The country’s EV boom not only gave rise to global leaders like BYD; it has also led to extensive overcapacity in which a crowd of carmakers are scrambling for market share. The Chinese government has long dealt out subsidies and other support for EV makers – part of a strategy that helped catapult the country to its position as the largest EV market globally and spur growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Relentless price wars have ensued, depleting profits and straining carmakers and suppliers. Even front-runners are squeezing parts makers to sell below cost, while extending payment terms for months, according to a dozen suppliers, carmakers, and industry experts who spoke to CNN. It’s an example of what Chinese officials decry as “disorderly” competition – and it extends beyond the EV sector to other Chinese industries like solar panels, e-commerce and food delivery. This all comes as EV brands including BYD, Chery, Geely and Changan have gone global, driving Chinese auto exports to nearly 6 million last year, more than any other country. But the flood of car exports has raised alarm abroad, prompting pushback like tariffs and restrictions from Europe, Mexico and Canada. Hoping to stabilize an embattled economy weighed down by deflationary pressure – driven partly by these overcrowded sectors slashing prices – Beijing is trying to pacify the commercial battles royale. In a published this month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for “cracking down on chaotic, cut-throat price wars among companies.” In recent months, Beijing has rolled out a series of measures to address the issue. Authorities have summoned auto leaders to warn them against initiating price wars, issued rules on shortening the payment cycle for the industry, and released guidelines urging local governments to scale back subsidies and eliminate overcapacity. But economists and industry experts doubt the measures so far will deliver a quick fix, and there appears to be no easy way to eliminate excess capacity. For years, Beijing has fueled growth through investment and subsidies. Simply axing excess capacity and allowing an environment where only a handful of brands survive – even if now desirable to Beijing – could trigger sizable job losses and risk dragging further on economic growth, experts said. “Those are definitely good starting steps, and that needs to happen,” Chetan Ahya, chief Asia economist at Morgan Stanley, said of the recent efforts. “But just cutting capacity will not be a perfect solution, there is going to be a social stability problem if you just decide to stop investing.” Employment sits at the core of social stability – the cornerstone of Communist Party rule. And China’s auto manufacturing industry employs more than 4.8 million people, according to figures from earlier this year from , a data provider. Ji Yue’s rapid rise and fall exemplified the brutal reality facing an industry plagued by excessive competition. Founded in 2021 as a joint venture between Chinese internet champion Baidu and leading automaker Geely, the startup quickly drew market attention. Li began supplying social media ads for Ji Yue in May last year. Impressed by his early dealings with the company, he felt confident enough to sign a long-term contract – even allowing extended payment terms to support the automaker. By late October, however, he realized the firm might have run into liquidity issues. Weeks later, Ji Yue a restructuring to seek new capital amid “fierce market competition” – effectively marking the end of its brief life. “For a large company backed by two major shareholders, with sales on the rise and several positive indicators in place, the fact that it could suddenly collapse was something I simply could not have anticipated,” Li said, adding that he has yet to receive repayment from the company. CNN has reached out to Baidu and Geely for comment on the collapse of their joint venture. China’s EV boom was born out of a huge bet that Beijing made on the then niche technology in the 2000s. By the early 2010s, the government declared it a strategic sector, showering it with the ample financial incentives that bred some of the world’s top EV makers like BYD, . It also resulted in nearly 500 domestic auto brands at their peak around 2019. The boom, however, soon became a bloodbath. “With limited market growth, products becoming more and more alike, and more competitors crowding in, the competition just keeps getting tougher,” said Bo Yu, country manager for China at Jato Dynamics, an automotive market intelligence firm. This has led China’s auto industry to undergo what some industry players called “knock-out rounds.” Today, more than 150 Chinese brands and over 50 EV makers continue to battle for survival, according to HSBC’s research. “Some companies are bound to go under – if not you, then them,” Li said. Many of the automakers and their suppliers still in the fight are biding their time to see who folds next. “A lot of EV makers are actually running at a loss right now. Most of their money comes from industrial funds or social capital, and they just keep raising new rounds to cover those losses,” said Shen Hong, an economics researcher at a Peking University think tank that advises the government. The average profit margins of China’s automotive companies plummeted to 4.3% last year, from nearly 8% in 2017, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed. All the while, the utilization rate of its manufacturing capacity continues to stand at around 50%, according to Morningstar, a financial services and research firm. Years of price wars have trapped the industry in a vicious cycle with squeezed margins, declining quality and a supply chain plagued with payment delays, according to the dozen industry players and experts. Many of the carmakers and suppliers declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. One consequence of the cut-throat competition is that automakers have made cost-cutting and efficiency the core of their operations, instead of focusing on innovation, said Carl Cheng, an insurance manager for an EV maker. Suppliers told CNN that auto brands would often request suppliers to deliver at least 10% discounts on their prices every year. “Suppliers have little choice but to quietly accept unfavorable terms,” Cheng said. “If you walk away, there are plenty of others ready to step in.” The overall quality of components of cars has undeniably declined, he added. In one extreme case, a coating materials supplier based in the central city of Wuhan said they were forced to lower prices by more than 40% just to stay in the game. “If you can’t cut costs anywhere else, what’s left? You cut wages. You bring in temporary workers, push overtime, squeeze out more efficiency – that’s basically all you can do,” the person said, adding that they had to cut workers’ pay by around 30%. Even after offering hefty discounts, suppliers face long waits to get paid. Many major Chinese carmakers employ supply chain financing that results in extended payment cycles, shifting financial risk onto partners, suppliers told CNN﻿. In recognition of the potential drag on economic growth, China has stepped up policy efforts, declaring an “anti-involution” campaign. “Involution,” or “neijuan” in Chinese, is an anthropological term that has come to describe excessive, self-defeating competition yielding little to no progress in the country. China’s top automotive regulator, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, in May in the auto sector, saying it undermines sustained investment in research and development, and erodes product quality and performance. In July, China’s top economic policymaking body, the , chaired by Xi, made the “governing of disorderly low-price competition” a policy focus. And to ease the payment pain for suppliers, Beijing has issued rules forcing carmakers to pay up within 60 days. On Friday, China by requiring licenses for carmakers to ship overseas from next year, to rein the practice of its EV brands flooding foreign markets with low-priced and sometimes lower-quality cars, which have drawn concerns of dumping from foreign governments. But industry players and experts are skeptical that the measures so far announced would be enough. For example, on the payment deadlines, the reality is that carmakers can still lean on the use of promissory notes, as many of them already do, experts said. “Compared with before, I don’t think the current price war has eased much at all,” Cheng said. “The reality is that newly launched models with lower prices draw in plenty of orders… at the end of the day automakers have to focus on survival.” Price competition could also exist in other forms, although increasing government scrutiny may restrain carmakers from making material price cuts, said Claire Yuan, a director and lead analyst focusing on China’s auto industry at ratings agency S&P Global. “With affordability key to gaining market share, they could still engage in stealth competition, such as launching new models at lower price ranges or upgrading existing models while keeping prices unchanged or offering other benefits,” she said. Vincent Sun, senior equity analyst at Morningstar covering China’s auto sector, also believes price competition will likely remain in the short term. “It may take a while, or more efforts than just anti-involution to solve this issue,” he said. For now, experts expect the price wars to continue until most brands go the way of Ji Yue, leaving only a handful standing. “When it comes to price wars, it’s just not very realistic to think they can be completely curbed through administrative measures,” said Shen, the researcher. Ahya of Morgan Stanley said tackling oversupply in sectors like EVs would be more difficult given the larger presence of private enterprises compared with state-owned ones, making consolidation more complex. Structural reforms are needed to fundamentally address overcapacity, he added. On a in late August, He Xiaopeng, founder and CEO of one of the leading EV makers in China, Xpeng, said no Chinese carmaker is out of the woods yet. “I think the knock-out rounds in China’s auto industry will go on for another five years,” he said. “There will likely be only five of them left.” Simone McCarthy contributed to this report.", "tags": ["war", "global", "electric", "cut", "kill", "cars", "price", "home", "chinese", "throat", "brands"]},
{"content": "Hundreds of trekkers stranded by a blizzard near the eastern face of in Tibet have been guided to safety by rescuers, Chinese state media reported, as unusually heavy snow and rainfall pummelled the Himalayas. Some 350 trekkers had reached the small township of Qudang, while contact with the remaining 200-plus trekkers had been made, CCTV reported on Sunday. Its Monday evening news bulletin did not provide any updates. Tibet media released a video showing trekkers being welcomed with hot soup in a communal hall, before boarding busses that took them away from the area. Visitors to the remote valley of Karma, which leads to the eastern Kangshung face of Everest, were in the hundreds this week, taking advantage of an eight-day National Day holiday in China. “It was so wet and cold in the mountains, and hypothermia was a real risk,” said Chen Geshuang, who was part of an 18-strong trekking team that made it to Qudang. “The weather this year is not normal. The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly.” Chen’s party descended from the mountains on Sunday and was greeted with sweet tea by villagers after enduring a harrowing evening of heavy snowfall combined with thunder and lightning. Hundreds of local villagers and rescue teams had been deployed to help remove snow blocking access to the area, where nearly 1,000 people had been trapped, according to an earlier report by state-backed Jimu News. The remaining trekkers will arrive in Qudang in stages under the assistance of rescuers organised by the local government, CCTV reported. The CCTV report did not say if local guides and support staff of the trekking parties had been accounted for. Snowfall in the valley, which lies at an elevation averaging 4,200 metres (13,800 feet), began on Friday evening and persisted throughout Saturday. “It was raining and snowing every day, and we did not see Everest at all,” said Eric Wen, who survived the ordeal. His trekking party of 18 had decided on Saturday night to make their way back from their fifth and final campsite, concerned by the continuous snowfall. “We only had a few tents. More than 10 of us were in the large tent and hardly slept,” Wen told Reuters on Monday. Wen said his group had to clear the snow every 10 minutes. “Otherwise our tents would have collapsed,” he said. Two men and a woman in the group suffered hypothermia when the temperature slipped below freezing, even though they were sufficiently attired, Wen said. But his expedition party emerged largely unscathed, including eight other expedition guides and several others who tended the yaks transporting their equipment and kit. Karma valley, first explored by Western travellers a century ago, is a relatively pristine part of the Everest region. Unlike the peak’s arid north face, it boasts lush vegetation and untouched alpine forests, fed by meltwaters from the Kangshung glacier at the foot of the world’s highest mountain. It was unclear if trekkers near the north face, which draws large numbers of tourists due to its easy access by paved road, had been affected. October is a peak season, when skies usually clear at the end of the Indian monsoon. To the south of Tibet in Nepal, heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 50 people since Friday. Thirty-seven people died in separate landslides in the eastern Ilam district bordering India. A South Korean trekker died in Nepal and his body was recovered by a rescue helicopter on Monday, said Tulsi Gurung, president of Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. His guide was rescued.

His supporters say he deserves the prize already, while his detractors mock the pursuit entirely – pointing to his controversial policies as disqualifying. Trump inherited two of the worst conflicts of this new century, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. On both fronts, the outlines of a settlement are now in view. It’s less clear whether Trump and his team can deliver peace. But if they do, the Nobel committee can and should recognize the achievement and award Trump its coveted medallion. Let’s start in Ukraine. After nine months of a zigzagging policy and a summer of summitry Zelensky, and , as well as a disastrous Russian offensive resulting in no territory gained and more than 20,000 Russian casualties, the shape of a deal may well be emerging – one with two main elements: That is the deal, with Ukraine unlikely to permit any agreement on land swaps separate from a security guarantee, and Russia unlikely to stop its disastrous war without a settlement on the territorial map. Getting there will require a sustained commitment of military supplies from the US and NATO to Ukraine, including air defenses and longer-range missiles. It will also require increasing sanctions and economic pressure on Moscow. After the recent UN General Assembly meetings in New York, Trump appears to have endorsed this approach, with US military equipment reaching Ukraine via purchases by NATO allies. For the first time, the Europeans are discussing in frozen Russian assets as a loan to Ukraine to help its economy and defense base withstand the ongoing war. So long as the White House remains consistent in this more determined approach, the odds will increase that Putin ultimately has no choice but to conclude a deal and save face. Russia has now suffered over 1 million military casualties in Putin’s war of choice, and its economy is increasingly stressed, with interest rates approaching 20 percent, and budgets dependent upon energy exports vulnerable to sanctions. If Trump can keep the pressure on Moscow together with shaping the contours of the deal to the end the war, a settlement is possible before the Nobel committee chooses its 2026 prize one year from now. Trump entered office with a three-phase ceasefire in place from the Biden administration, designed to end the war in Gaza altogether with a second phase envisioning interim security and political structures, along with a massive reconstruction program for the enclave. The framework for the “day after” had been developed with details to be finalized during the first phase, a period of six weeks in which hostages were to be released and assistance surged into Gaza. Tragically, the ceasefire broke down after the first phase in March. The last six months have seen some of the most intensive Israeli military operations to date, together with a humanitarian crisis, during which Israel blockaded Gaza’s borders for the first time. Two weeks ago, any claim to the Nobel prize seemed dubious due to the situation in Gaza. Talks had stalled, and Israel was beginning a controversial military operation to seize Gaza City and the northern quarter of the Gaza strip. Senior Israeli officials also claimed that Israel planned to occupy Gaza, perhaps resettle its territory with Israelis, and force out Gazans as they did so. The situation was moving from bad, to worse. That changed last week, after Trump presented a to end the war, with Israel renouncing annexation or occupation and Hamas required to relinquish its control over Gaza as well as release all hostages, living and the dead. This plan resembles what had been envisioned for Phase 2 of the January deal, and it has received Israel’s endorsement, as well as support from Arab and Muslim-majority states, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Pakistan, and Indonesia. Having worked on this issue and helped lead negotiations for the only two ceasefires of this awful war, including the deal concluded in January, I commend the president and his team, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner for finalizing this program and for the diplomacy required to build such a broad group of countries in support. There is now consensus that Hamas cannot remain in control of Gaza once this war ends, and that Gaza requires an international effort organized by the US to restore security and establish new governance structures to displace Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades. Hamas last week offered its own qualified endorsement of the plan, and talks are now taking place in Cairo to organize the release of hostages together with an exchange of Palestinian prisoners. I suspect that Hamas will seek delays and reject the obligation to disarm and abandon its security control of Gaza. Trump is right to keep the pressure on Hamas, writing on Saturday that delays are unacceptable, as well as on Isreal. This week may determine whether Hamas is finally prepared to release the hostages, and the group should hear from all countries with influence to do so without further wrangling. But the plan makes clear that it will be implemented regardless of what Hamas says in areas the group no longer controls. This can hasten the end of the war, and a new reality of a Gaza without Hamas, a necessary condition for longer term peace. Israel must do its part as well, including the renunciation of any plan to reoccupy or resettle Gaza – essential for any such longer-term initiatives, as is Israel’s acceptance in Trump’s plan of “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” At bottom, the US has now outlined the end to the Gaza war and the pathway to longer-term coexistence and peace between Israelis and Palestinians.  Many of its clauses are broad principles, but the requirements are clear: Hamas must return all hostages and renounce its control of Gaza in exchange for many Palestinian prisoners, a ceasefire, and pullback of Israel forces.  Anyone who wants to stop this horrific war should now call on Hamas to accept the terms without delay. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded each year on December 10, the date of Alfred Nobel’s death in 1896. The committee chooses its recipient two months earlier – on October 10th. Trump is no doubt hoping he may secure the award this week. That is highly unlikely. But next year marks the 125th anniversary of the prize, and Trump may well have a claim. I that 2026 will be a gateway between a world of consolidation and stabilization or increasing disorder and conflict. The wars in Gaza and Ukraine are two touchstones that if resolved would help enhance integration and interconnectivity across the Middle East and Europe with, respectively, Iranian and Russian ambitious deterred, and a knock-on strategic consequence of reducing risks of conflict over Taiwan. President Trump and his team deserve credit for helping to put in place the frameworks for ending both wars.  If they can now follow through and not lose focus over the coming year (a big if), then Trump will credibly lay claim as to the 125th Nobel Peace Prize. Whatever one might think of President Trump and his administration, on these two most essential issues of war and peace, we should all hope that he succeeds.", "tags": ["peace", "trump", "nobel", "yes"]},

Now, they’re being unleashed on a new scourge – negativity. The country’s internet regulator on Monday aimed at curbing pessimism trending on social media, live-streaming and short-video platforms. Some content being targeted “maliciously misinterprets social phenomena, selectively exaggerates negative cases, and uses them as an opportunity to promote nihilistic or otherwise negative worldviews,” the statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China said. Others “excessively self-deprecate or amplify feelings of despair and negativity, prompting others to follow suit,” it added. Years of economic downturn triggered by a property crisis have crushed consumer confidence, dampened consumption and increased unemployment, particularly among young people in China – dimming their prospects and outlook on life. Such sentiment has given rise to the young generation’s embrace of lifestyles like “ ” a term describing the pursuit of a simple, stress-free life that gained prominence on the Chinese internet in 2021. The crackdown announced this week came after multiple bloggers known for documenting their “lying flat” lifestyle reported that their videos had been deleted and their social media accounts banned. The internet regulator has also recently penalized internet platforms for failing to moderate content posted on their sites. Popular social media platform , the TikTok-like , and the Chinese equivalent of Instagram, , were all disciplined this month for allowing “harmful” information like “hyping around celebrities’ personal updates and trivial matters” to appear in trending topics. In the Monday statement, the internet regulator said the crackdown also covers content “inciting extreme confrontation between groups,” “spreading fear and anxiety,” and “fueling online violence and hostility.” Online posts, comments and trending topics about economic rumours, doxxing techniques, and “defeatist narratives like ‘effort is useless’” all fall under the purview of this campaign. It also targets content “selling anxiety” by exploiting concerns around employment, dating, and education to promote sales of classes or related products. The regulator urged the public to “actively report such cases” to “resist the malicious incitement of negative sentiment.” A on Tuesday praised the campaign as a “timely” response to the “prevailing chaos.” “The harm of such maliciously divisive content is significant. It can trigger collective misunderstandings and social panic, marginalize reason and facts, and even spark offline conflicts, causing long-term damage to public order and social trust,” it wrote. Ja Ian Chong, a professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, who focuses on China, observed that there appears to be a “significant lack of motivation, even pessimism” among Chinese people regarding individual prospects. He said it was “reasonable to expect” Chinese authorities would seek to encourage consumer confidence and higher consumption to push economic growth. “One way to do so may be to manage public sentiment online,” he said.

Chong said that, while the crackdown could well change the tone online, the general sentiment is less likely to change without better life and career prospects, and that China’s internet users would, as they have done in the past, find ways to express themselves online. The most recent response to outside pressures amid the economic slowdown has been the emergence of on the internet – Chinese youths embracing a rodent-like lifestyle, which includes burrowing in bed and ordering delivery meals to avoid going outside. “The state will try to clamp down on these new terms and expressions as they emerge, but they will simply continue to evolve,” Chong said.", "tags": ["china", "target", "censors", "internet"]},
{"content": "Russia rained missiles and drones on Ukraine in a mass overnight attack, officials said on Sunday, killing at least five people and damaging civilian infrastructure including energy facilities across numerous regions. Moscow has stepped up attacks particularly on Ukraine’s energy grid and gas production sites in recent weeks as the fourth winter of war approaches, and as diplomatic efforts to end the fighting have stalled. Four of the victims in the overnight attacks were family members killed when their residential building in the western region of Lviv bordering Poland was destroyed, local prosecutors said. An industrial park in Lviv’s regional capital was also set ablaze and parts of the city had been left without power, said mayor Andriy Sadovyi, who had urged residents early on Sunday to stay inside as authorities battled multiple fires. A Reuters correspondent heard explosions booming across the dark morning sky as air defenses engaged targets from several directions. The attack on Lviv was the largest of the war on the Lviv region, said governor Maksym Kozytskyi, adding it involved 140 drones and 23 missiles. In the village outside Lviv where the family members were killed, rescue workers dug through heaps of rubble. Only the foundation of their building remained. Volodymyr Hutnyk, a local official, said 10 other nearby homes were damaged beyond repair. In southeastern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia, one person was killed and 10 others wounded in a combined strike that left more than 73,000 customers without power, said governor Ivan Fedorov. Service had been restored to more than 20,000 by early afternoon, he said. Civilian infrastructure was also damaged in the regions of Ivano-Frankivsk, Vinnytsia, Chernihiv, Kherson, Kharkiv and Odesa, said Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko. Ukraine’s energy ministry said energy facilities had been damaged in Zaporizhzhia and the northern Chernihiv region. Ukrainian state gas and oil company Naftogaz said Russia had struck and damaged gas infrastructure, but did not offer any details. Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Sunday its forces had struck Ukrainian military-industrial facilities as well as gas and energy infrastructure overnight. “Another deliberate act of terror against civilians,” Svyrydenko wrote on . “Moscow continues to strike homes, schools, and energy facilities – proving that destruction remains its only strategy.” President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had fired more than 50 missiles and nearly 500 drones. NATO member Poland said it scrambled aircraft early on Sunday to ensure its air safety. “Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, while ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems have been brought to the highest state of readiness,” Poland’s operational command said in a post on . Eastern-flank NATO members are on high alert after Poland shot down suspected Russian drones in its airspace in September and drone sightings and air incursions, including in Copenhagen and Munich, have led to chaos in European aviation.

{"content": "American farmers are having , in no small part because of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Now, the White House is gearing up to extend them a multi-billion-dollar bailout, sources tell CNN. Surging costs and foreign retaliation from tariffs the US agriculture industry — as have immigration-related labor shortages and plummeting commodity prices. Farm production expenses are estimated to reach $467.4 billion in 2025, according to the Agriculture Department, up $12 billion from last year. Farm bankruptcies rose in the first half of the year to the highest level since 2021, according to US courts data. Trump’s policies have exacerbated those woes, from the deportation of the industry’s key migrant workforce to renewed trade tensions between the United States and China. And for traditional American crops, such as soybeans, the situation has grown particularly precarious. “There’s no doubt that the farm economy is in a significant challenge right now, especially our row croppers,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters Tuesday. “So not just soybeans, although I think they’re probably the top of the list, but corn, wheat, sorghum, cotton, et cetera.” Indeed, the US soybean industry has become in the first year of Trump’s second term. The president recognizes these problems, White House officials tells CNN, and has increased pressure on his administration to address them urgently. Over the past few weeks, the White House has held a series of interagency meetings with the Departments of Agriculture and Treasury as they attempt to finalize a relief package for US farmers, the sources said. Discussions over the best way to aid the agriculture industry are ongoing, the officials said, but they have zeroed in on two options. The first reported the discussions. “There are a lot of levers we can use to help ease the pain they are feeling,” one of the officials told CNN. One idea, floated publicly by Trump as recently as Wednesday, is to give farmers a percentage of the income the United States is receiving from the administration’s tariffs on goods being imported into the country. “We’ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers. I WILL NEVER LET OUR FARMERS DOWN!” Trump wrote on social media this week. The other is tapping into a “slush fund,” as the officials described it, at the Department of Agriculture. The Trump administration also dipped into the fund, known as Emergency Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP), in March to similarly provide assistance to farmers. USDA at the time issued $10 billion in direct payments to eligible agricultural producers of eligible commodities for the 2024 crop year. The administration has also discussed implementing a combination of the two, depending on where they can most quickly pull the funds from, one White House official said. The current range of aid they are looking to offer ranges from $10 billion to $14 billion. “The final figure will depend on how much farmers need and the amount of tariff revenue coming in,” the official told CNN. Trump himself as privately been applying pressure on his team to ensure that American farmers, many of whom the Trump administration credit for helping the president win the November 2024 election, are protected. But the other reason they are making the agriculture industry such a priority, officials say, is because the Trump administration views protecting farmers as a national security issue. “We need to grow our own food. We can’t rely on imports from other countries, that poses a problem for national security. And right now, the government is subsidizing a lot of that process,” one Trump administration official argued. An issue complicating the Trump administration’s goals revolve around soybeans — America’s largest agricultural export, valued at more than $24 billion in 2024, according to USDA data. Last year, about half of those exports went to China, but since May, that’s dropped as a result of an effective embargo China has placed on US soybeans in retaliation for Trump’s tariffs on the country. China has implemented 20% tariffs on US soybeans, making the crop from other countries significantly more attractive. That couldn’t come at worse time for soybean farmers, with the harvest season in full swing and some farms reporting strong yields. And their luck might not change anytime soon, with Beijing ramping up its reliance on South America — inadvertently aided the US Treasury’s financial lifeline provided to Argentina in recent weeks. Last week, the Trump administration said it would arrange to Argentina’s central bank, which would exchange US dollars for pesos to help stabilize Argentina’s financial market. Argentina also temporarily scrapped export taxes on grains to help stabilize the peso, but China didn’t waste any time. Beijing purchased “at least 10 cargoes of Argentine soybeans,” according to a report from Reuters. Brazil has also helped meet China’s demand for soybeans, with both countries announcing a pact in July to deepen agricultural trade ties. As a result, America’s hobbled soybean industry is calling on the Trump administration to finish its trade negotiations with China. “US soybean farmers have been clear for months: the administration needs to secure a trade deal with China. China is the world’s largest soybean customer and typically our top export market,” American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said last week in a statement. Many farmers say time is of the essence as they start to bring in this year’s crop. “We’re always hopeful that those negotiations are moving forward, but yet with harvest here, patience may be running thin,” one Indiana farmer told CNN, describing the industry’s many challenges, which also include the deportation of key workers. Trump has heard the calls for action. On Wednesday, Trump blamed China for the pain soybean farmers are facing, arguing Beijing is refusing to buy soybeans for negotiating purposes amid the two countries’ tariff dispute. He added that he plans to make soybeans “a major topic of discussion” when he meets face-to-face with China’s President Xi Jinping in South Korea next month. Part of the reason Trump has given the issue so much attention, White House officials say, is because Rollins has forced the issue with not only the president, but also one of his closest advisers: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. On Tuesday, a went viral, showing a text from a contact named “BR,” presumed to be Rollins. Her messages illustrated panic within the Trump administration over the soybean industry’s woes, which worsened over the Argentina ordeal. During this “time of uncertainty” for farmers and ranchers, Rollins said that she is in “constant communication” with the White House and partners across the government. Rollins also called Trump’s idea of temporarily giving tariff revenue to farmers “a very elegant solution.” “To this moment of uncertainty, the ability to offset any payments to the farmers through potential tariff revenue is really where the president wants us to head, and that’s what we’re looking at,” she added.", "tags": ["war", "bailout", "american", "hurt", "least", "trump", "considers", "farmers", "massive"]},

A photo of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s phone captured by the Associated Press shows a text from a contact named “BR,” presumed to be US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. The message linked to the X account of grain trader Ben Scholl, who has sounded the alarm on what Argentina’s massive bailout means for America’s soybean farmers. “Just a heads up. I am getting more intel, but this is highly unfortunate. We bailed out Argentina yesterday and in return, the Argentine’s (sic) removed their export tariffs on grains, reducing their price to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,” the message said. “Soy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,” the message added. “On a plane but scott I can call you when I land.” Administration officials did not respond to requests for comment. The caught-on-camera text conversation appears to show how President Donald Trump’s haphazard foreign policy agenda has produced a number of unintended negative consequences for American farmers — a situation Trump has acknowledged by suggesting his administration to help bail them out. “There’s no doubt that the farm economy is in a significant challenge right now, especially our row croppers,” Rollins told reporters Tuesday. “The ability to offset any payments to the farmers through potential tariff revenue is really where the president wants us to head, and that’s what we’re looking at,” she added. Since taking power in 2023, Argentina’s President Javier Milei has overhauled the country’s spending and regulations. That has resulted in some success, such as monthly inflation slowing from over 25% to around 2%. But other corners of the Argentine economy are languishing, and the president’s party got trounced in local elections earlier this month. Milei has a powerful friend in Trump, who has praised the chainsaw-wielding libertarian and endorsed his reelection last week, saying: “To the people of Argentina, we’re backing him 100%.” The Trump administration has said it is arranging to Argentina’s central bank, which would exchange US dollars for pesos to help stabilize Argentina’s financial market. Bessent said the deal would function as a “bridge to the election,” thereby allowing Milei to continue with his radical reforms. But after Argentina temporarily rolled back its export tax on grain in the hopes of juicing sales, China snapped up “at least 10 cargoes of Argentine soybeans,” according to The move has further complicated America’s trade relationship with China: Once the largest buyer of American soybeans — Beijing bought $12.5 billion worth last year — USDA data shows it has not purchased any US soybeans since May, amid a trade spat with Washington. The situation has hobbled America’s $60.7 billion soybean industry, and there seems to be no concrete solution in sight without a trade deal and China reconfiguring its soybean supply chain. “US soybean farmers have been clear for months: the administration needs to secure a trade deal with China. China is the world’s largest soybean customer and typically our top export market,” American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a September 24 statement. “The US has made zero sales to China in this new crop marketing year due to 20% retaliatory tariffs imposed by China in response to US tariffs.” Trump on Thursday at the White House suggested that his administration may distribute some tariff revenue to American farmers on a temporary basis to help alleviate their financial strain from his policies. “We’re going to take some of that tariff money that we’ve made, we’re going to give it to our farmers, who are — for a little while — going to be hurt until it kicks in, the tariffs kick in to their benefit,” Trump said. It’s the latest frustration for American farmers as they start to bring in this year’s crop. “We’re always hopeful that those negotiations are moving forward, but yet with harvest here, patience may be running thin,” , describing the result on America’s heartland of inflation, Trump’s trade war and the deportation of the industry’s key migrant workforce. “This is not your ordinary farm crisis.

{"content": "The Trump Administration ramped up its pressure on Chinese tech firms on Monday by expanding restrictions imposed on certain companies to also cover their subsidiaries, a move that’s drawn the ire of Beijing as the two powers remain locked in a technology race. The US action aims to stop sanctioned companies – including technology champion Huawei, memory chip giant YMTC and drone maker DJI – from evading export controls by funnelling restricted technologies through their subsidiaries. The new rule “closes a significant loophole,” the US Department of Commerce , by making any subsidiary at least 50% owned by a firm already on the export controls list face the same restrictions as the parent company – a shift that could affect tens of thousands of companies. In response, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce “extremely malicious,” adding that the country would “take necessary measures” to protect the rights and interests of its companies. “Beijing urges Washington to immediately correct its wrongdoing and stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies,” the spokesperson said. The curbs mark a fresh attempt by Washington to tighten restrictions already imposed on over a thousand of Chinese firms, which the Commerce Department deemed a risk to US national security or foreign policy interests. Entities on the list are required to obtain licenses for exporting certain products or technologies. The restricted technologies cover a large swathe of future-defining industries such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, advanced robotics, and equipment needed to produce them. The new rule will also extend to entities in the “Military End-User list,” which aims to prevent dual-use items from being diverted for military purposes. The announcement injects fresh uncertainty into the ongoing US-China trade war, just weeks before President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are at the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea. While the rule change does not specifically single out China, Chinese and Russian entities dominate the so-called ‘entity list,’ primarily for aiding their nations’ military technology advancements. China, in particular, has in recent years alarmed Washington with its rapid progress in chip and AI technologies, prompting the and hundreds of others in subsequent years. “For too long, loopholes have enabled exports that undermine American national security and foreign policy interests,” said Jeffrey I. Kessler, Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security, in the department’s statement. Experts and policy advisors have long warned against the possibilities of restricted companies utilizing their subsidiaries or affiliates to bypass the curbs. In 2023, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee describing the use of the entity list as “ineffective” and calling for a new approach such as that announced this week. In an example cited in the report, Huawei sold its smartphone brand Honor to a consortium that included the Chinese government in 2020, after it was added to the entity list. Honor has never been blacklisted. A said the case of Huawei and Honor exemplified Chinese companies “restructuring themselves potentially to circumvent US export and investment restrictions.” In a accompanying Monday’s announcement, the bureau responsible for export controls at the commerce department said it was concerned “the old approach can enable diversionary schemes, such as the creation of new foreign companies to evade Entity List restrictions.” The expansion of controls to cover subsidiaries of listed entities took place immediately on Monday, with some companies granted exemptions for 60 days, the Commerce Department said.", "tags": ["firms", "tech", "pressure", "anger", "malicious", "chinese", "beijing"]},

Several regions announced in recent days they would as much as quadruple the sign-up bonuses in a bid to boost their recruitment numbers. Russia has been suffering enormous casualties in its war on Ukraine, with an estimated Russian soldiers killed or injured since the start of the full-scale invasion three and half years ago. Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov made recruitment one of the military’s top priorities during a high-level defense meeting in August, stressing that manpower was “key for supporting offensive operations.” But while Belousov claimed recruitment targets were being met, the independent Russian investigative outlet IStories reported otherwise. It said that, based on official budget expenditure data, some 37,900 people signed contracts with the defense ministry in the second quarter of 2025 – two-and-a-half times fewer than a year ago. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based conflict monitor, said that Russian force generation efforts were “increasingly resembling complex business models rather than an ideologically driven recruitment campaign.” In an analyst note in September, the ISW said Russian authorities and informal recruiters “continue to employ financial incentives, deception, and coercion” to bolster recruitment. The government of the Tyumen region in Siberia said on Monday that it would pay new recruits a lump sum of 3 million rubles ($36,560), on top of the 400,000 rubles they get from the federal government – as long as the recruits sign up before the end of November.

{"content": "During the last presidential campaign, Donald Trump made clear his motivations in trying to retake the White House. “In 2016, I declared ‘I am your voice.’ Today I add, I am your warrior, I am your justice and for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” Trump said at the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference. More than two years later, Trump has so far used his second term to make good on that promise, enacting what in many cases appears to be payback against a wide swath of critics and perceived political enemies. Through a mix of presidential powers including executive orders and federal investigations, Trump has sought retribution on a number of fronts, targeting those involved in the multiple legal cases against him, including his indictments for and attempting to , as well as the probe into Russia’s in the 2016 election. In a high-profile case, New York Attorney General Letitia James was on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James led the successful civil fraud lawsuit against Trump, three of his children and a pair of business associates. A few weeks earlier, former FBI director James Comey was indicted on September 25 on charges of obstruction of a congressional proceeding and giving false statements. He is the first person to face federal charges in one of Trump’s largest grievances: the 2016 investigation into whether his first presidential campaign colluded with Russia. Comey pleaded not guilty to both charges. Trump told reports following Comey’s indictment that he expects other political opponents to be prosecuted. “It’s not a list, but I think there will be others,” Trump said. In another act of retribution, the home of John Bolton — Trump’s former national security adviser who has since become publicly critical of his former boss — was by the FBI on August 22, which some saw as an escalation of the president’s retribution agenda. The investigation and was recently reopened by the Justice Department. Senior Justice Department leaders are advocating for a charge against Bolton, . Trump also moved to of former Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent in the 2024 election. The president also previously canceled the security details of and , an official from his first term. Trump has also revoked the security clearances of more than 100 people so far, including high-ranking officials from the Biden administration, and many other long-time government officials. He’s also fired scores of people, and sought to investigate many of his public critics, including former members of his own prior administration. Several of Trump’s actions have faced legal challenges — with mixed success. Among the people targeted by Trump, several have yet to comment, while others have remained defiant. Some have also slammed his moves as being politically motivated. In a statement to CNN, the White House said: “Joe Biden weaponized his Administration to target political opponents – most famously, President Trump.” “President Trump is restoring integrity to our government,” White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said in the statement. “Anyone who engages in criminal activity should be held accountable. No one is above the law. President Trump’s only retribution is success and historic achievements for the American people.” Here are some of the people Trump and his administration have targeted: Trump faced four indictments and one during his time out of office, along with a loss in a civil case involving his business. The president has since decried that all the probes were politically motivated weaponization of the Justice Department. Prior to her , New York Attorney General Letitia James was under investigation since May over a 2023 mortgage she took out to help her niece buy a home in Norfolk, Virginia. In August, the office, seeking information about her investigations into the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, sources told CNN. A grand jury investigation into James is also underway, according to a source familiar, which looks into whether James violated Trump’s constitutional rights. “Attorney General James is focused every single day on protecting New Yorkers, especially as this Administration weaponizes the federal government against the rule of law and the Constitution,” a spokesperson for James said in a statement to CNN. “She will not be intimidated by bullies – no matter who they are.” Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led criminal probes into Trump’s of classified documents and alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election, is also under investigation. The Office of the Special Counsel — which is distinct from special counsels, like Smith, who are appointed to oversee politically sensitive Justice Department investigations — is , which limits certain political activities of government workers. Attorneys for Smith obtained by CNN that the investigation is based on “imaginary and unfounded” accusations. “Mr. Smith followed well-established legal principles in conducting the investigations into President Trump, and the courts presiding over the resulting prosecutions have already rejected the spurious allegations that the manner in which Mr. Smith prosecuted these cases was somehow improper,” his attorneys Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski wrote. Trump also took aim at the National Archives, a historically non-political agency that became embroiled in Trump’s legal cases after it asked the Justice Department to investigate Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left office in his first term. Soon after returning to the White House, Trump fired , the archivist of the United States, and forced out deputy archivist . A source told CNN that Trump officials made it clear to staff at the National Archives that the White House wanted to remove the leadership team and replace top officials with Trump loyalists. Shogan at the time that she wasn’t given any reason for her firing, adding, “I have zero regrets.” In August, — the former acting FBI director before Trump’s nominee Kash Patel was confirmed — was also fired. Driscoll said in a letter to his colleagues that he was not given a reason for his firing either, adding, “Our collective sacrifices for those we serve is, and will always be, worth it. I regret nothing,” A source told CNN that among the issues that caused discord with top officials in the FBI was Driscoll not disciplining an FBI pilot for Patel after it was discovered he was involved in issuing a subpoena in the Mar-a-Lago investigation into Trump and associates. In his effort to shrink and overhaul the federal workforce, Trump directed agencies to fire employees en masse. Then, the president fired two officials who were tasked with protecting federal employees. In February, Hampton Dellinger — the former head of the Office of Special Counsel who protected whistleblowers from retaliation — and Cathy Harris — former chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews federal employee firings — were removed from their jobs. Dellinger sued the Trump administration but after some legal back and forth, he ultimately , citing long odds of winning at the Supreme Court after the federal Circuit Court in Washington, DC sided with Trump’s Justice Department to keep him out of the special counsel role. Dellinger said in a statement at the time, “The harm to the agency and those who rely on it caused by a Special Counsel who is not independent could be immediate, grievous, and, I fear, uncorrectable.” A federal judge in March ruled that , finding that Trump unlawfully fired her. Harris celebrated the ruling at the time, saying “I’m glad the Court has ruled on just how illegal Donald Trump’s action here has been.” Trump also fired a high-ranking official critical of his efforts to reshape the federal government. Cameron Hamilton, acting director of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was in May — a day after he broke with the administration and told lawmakers that he does not support dismantling the agency. And in August, FEMA effective immediately, just one day after they that the Trump administration’s sweeping ﻿overhaul of the agency could lead to catastrophic failures in disaster response. In the letter, more than 180 current and former FEMA employees — most signing anonymously — asked Congress to make FEMA a Cabinet-level, independent agency – insulated from political meddling and empowered to respond swiftly when disaster strikes. The authors warned in the letter: “we hope (these changes) come in time to prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people.” Trump has defended rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, since the end of his first term. Once he returned to office, he gave broad clemency to the rioters and targeted those who investigated and brought charges against them. Michael Gordon, the former assistant US Attorney in the US Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida, was fired in June. In a lawsuit with two other former Justice Department officials, Gordon that his dismissal was a “ ” because he prosecuted high-profile January 6 cases. Similarly, — the former acting director of the Washington Field Office for the FBI, who played a role in the investigation of January 6 rioters — was also dismissed from his role in August. Trump has also gone after James Dennehy, the head of the FBI’s New York division, who vowed to support FBI employees who were asked to explain their involvement in the agency’s investigation of January 6. After saying that he’s preparing to “dig in” to defend those FBI employees, Dennehy wrote in an email to colleagues in March that he was told he Four officials from Trump’s first term are currently under investigation after speaking out against the president. The FBI’s search of Bolton’s home was part of a renewed investigation into whether he disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump had previously threatened to jail Bolton over the 2020 book, which was critical of Trump’s foreign policy knowledge, and the Justice Department investigated him during Trump’s first term. Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has also been a critic of his former boss and even called him a fascist. Just days into Trump’s second term, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth into Milley to determine whether a review of his rank is necessary. Meanwhile, , Trump called for an investigation into former Department of Homeland Security official Miles Taylor and former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Chris Krebs. Taylor anonymously wrote a 2018 New York Times op-ed claiming he was part of the “resistance” to Trump’s presidency. In the op-ed, Taylor said “many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.” Taylor, who subsequently went in October 2020, went on to write a book, “Anonymous,” that was critical of Trump. Speaking at the White House after the executive order, Trump that Taylor was “guilty of treason.” Taylor responded to the executive order in a , saying, “I said this would happen. Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path. Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man’s point.” during Trump’s first term after he rejected the president’s claims of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election. “He’s the fraud. He’s a disgrace,” Trump of Krebs in April. Following the executive order, Krebs resigned as the chief intelligence and public policy officer at SentinelOne, and referenced the investigation in his , which he posted on LinkedIn. “For those who know me, you know I don’t shy away from tough fights. But I also know this is one I need to take on fully — outside of SentinelOne,” the letter read. “This will require my complete focus and energy. It’s a fight for democracy, for freedom of speech, and for the rule of law. I’m prepared to give it everything I’ve got.” The Trump administration has also gone after at least three other Justice Department employees, firing them for separate reasons. In April, Trump’s — an immigration lawyer who argued for the government in the mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — accusing him of sabotaging its legal case. Reuveni was initially placed on administrative leave and then fired after he expressed frustration with the government’s inability to provide answers to questions from a judge in the case. As the Trump administration faced mounting scrutiny over its handling of documents related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, the Justice Department in July fired , a federal prosecutor in the Epstein case and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, who has been critical of Trump. James Comey was fired by Trump in his first term. The Justice Department in July also fired prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace after she was chosen by federal judges in New Jersey to replace Alina Habba, Trump’s pick for US attorney in the state, whose interim appointment was set to expire. Following her firing, Grace posted a , in which she pushed back that politics played any part in her job performance and vowed to assume the position she was appointed to by the judges. Two high-ranking officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were in July. Both officials — Steve Volz, who heads NOAA’s satellites division, and Jeff Dillen, deputy NOAA general counsel — into whether were violated during the of Trump’s first term. A copy of a letter informing Volz he was being placed on leave references an “investigation” into his “recent conduct,” though NOAA sources did not know what that may refer to. The letter came from acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm. It is not clear if Dillen’s letter also referenced an investigation. The Sharpiegate scandal appears to be the only significant event that links the two men, though the personnel moves could be coincidental. In 2019, Trump modified the National Weather Service’s forecast cone of Hurricane Dorian — with a sharpie — to suggest that the storm might hit Alabama. Volz and Dillen’s investigation found that then-acting NOAA administrator Neil Jacobs and another NOAA official violated the agency’s scientific integrity policy by backing Trump’s hand-drawn version of the forecast. Jacobs has been nominated to become NOAA administrator in Trump’s current term. In an interview with the Washington Post, Volz questioned the move to put him on leave, asking, “Why now?” “Maybe the desire here is to get anybody who might slow down their ability to execute their plan out of the way. I think I’m one of those people,” he told the Post. Trump has also sought retribution against two men connected to the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election: former FBI director and former CIA director . Both are by the FBI. Comey later that he orchestrated the leak of accounts of conversations with Trump because he thought it might lead to the appointment of a special prosecutor to lead the Russia election probe. On Sept. 25, a federal grand jury with two felony counts that go hand-in-hand: Obstruction of the congressional proceeding where he testified on September 30, 2020, and making a false statement to Congress during that testimony. Meanwhile, Brennan — who was the CIA director under former President Barack Obama — in 2017 that Russia “brazenly interfered” in US elections, including actively contacting members of Trump’s campaign. However, he stopped shy of dubbing it a “collusion.” The investigation into Russian election interference ultimately did not find that Trump’s campaign or associates conspired with Russia or that Trump committed a crime. But the investigation also did not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice. When news broke of the investigation, Brennan told MSNBC that he was not contacted by the FBI, Justice Department or CIA. “I am clueless about what it is exactly that they may be investigating me for,” Brennan said. Following a weaker-than-expected jobs report in July, Trump fired , the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her, without evidence, of manipulating the monthly jobs reports for “political purposes.” Meanwhile, the Department of Defense went after , a former top national security official in the Biden administration. The Army secretary in July ordered the US Military Academy at West Point to rescind an offer of employment to Easterly after far-right activist Laura Loomer, who has a direct line to Trump, criticized her appointment. Easterly responded in a LinkedIn post, saying the move was “a casualty of casually manufactured outrage that drowned out the quiet labor of truth and the steady pulse of integrity.” “The Warrior Ethos was forged into me long ago, and it does not waver now,” she added. Lt. Gen. , who served as head of the US Defense Intelligence Agency, was also fired. Sources told CNN that the DIA’s to Iranian nuclear sites from US strikes angered Trump. Since taking office, Trump has revoked security clearances for more than 100 former government officials, including many high-ranking members of the Biden administration. Trump in February revoked former President Joe Biden’s security clearance, though former presidents typically do not have security clearances. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former national security advisor Jake Sullivan and former US deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco have also had their security clearances revoked, with Trump arguing that it is “no longer in the national interest” for them to have access to classified information. Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state and Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential election, also had her security clearance revoked. New York AG Letitia James faced the same consequence, along with Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who led the hush money case against Trump. The following Trump critics, who are under investigation, have also had their security clearances revoked: Bolton, Milley, Taylor and Krebs. Similarly, former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger — the two Republicans who sat on the House select committee that investigated the Capitol riot — have lost their security clearances, as have some people involved in Trump’s first impeachment inquiry. That includes Alexander Vindman, a former top Ukraine expert for the National Security Council who was a witness in the inquiry; Fiona Hill, Trump’s former top Russia adviser who also testified; Mark Zaid, who represented the whistleblower whose complaint led to the inquiry; and Norman Eisen, who served as counsel to House Democrats during the inquiry. Vindman said in a , I’m not a weak-kneed billionaire or a massive spineless law firm, so I don’t care what noises @realDonaldTrump makes about a security clearance that hasn’t been active for five years.” “Revoking my security clearance constitutes an attack on the rule of law and destroys decades of established due process precedent,” Zaid said in a statement to CNN. Norm Eisen said in a , “It’s like the third time (Trump’s) announced he’s revoking my security clearance … Who does he think I am, a big law firm or a billionaire who’s gonna back down? It just makes me file even more lawsuits!” Kinzinger commented at the time on the revocation with a , saying: “Here’s the funny thing, dude, I retired a year ago from the military. I don’t even have a security clearance.” He captioned the post: “Living rent free in orange man’s head.” Trump has also revoked the security clearances of Andrew Weissmann — a former prosecutor in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. A bulk of the revocations are tied to a 2020 letter arguing that emails from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden carried “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” More than that letter and on his first day back in office, Trump revoked all their security clearances — though many of the former officials are long retired and did not hold active clearances. Those who signed the letter include Brennan, former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper, and former acting CIA directors John McLaughlin and Michael Morell. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, at Trump’s direction, issued another round of revocations in August, moving to cancel the security clearances of .

In addition, 15 arriving flights were diverted Thursday to the German cities of Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Frankfurt, as well as Vienna in neighboring Austria, the statement said. Flight tracking website Flightradar showed several planes circling the airport at around 11pm local time before heading to other destinations. The airport reopened at 5 a.m. local time Friday when flight arrivals and departures were deemed safe, a call handler fielding passenger enquiries told CNN. “Now everything has resumed. Some flights were cancelled but the airport has reopened. Since 5 a.m, all arrivals and departures are safe,” they said. The first plane scheduled to land in Munich was a Lufthansa long haul flight from Bangkok, estimated to touch down at 5.25 a.m, according to the airport’s website. The airport in Bavaria, southern Germany, is a hub for German flag-carrier Lufthansa, and served nearly 20 million passengers in the first half of this year. A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN that 19 of its flights were cancelled or diverted due to the closure, including three long-haul flights to Asia which are set to be rescheduled. It had provided the affected passengers with food, drink and blankets, they said. Agency photos showed people sleeping on a row of camp beds.

Munich becomes the latest European airport to close after sightings of drones nearby. A spate of sightings over several airports across Denmark and Norway in recent weeks saw tens of thousands of passengers impacted. Denmark later banned all civil drone flights in its airspace as it prepared to host a summit of European leaders in Copenhagen this week to discuss support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, and bolstering European security. During a four-hour televised event on Thursday, which touched on multiple key sticking points with Europe and the US, Russian President Vladimir Putin scoffed at Western claims of possible Russian involvement in recent drone flights over Denmark, casting them as part of purported NATO efforts to “inflame tensions to boost the defense spending.” “I won’t anymore. Not to France, not to Denmark, not to Copenhagen,” he joked, in reference to the drone flight allegations. But he also issued a veiled threat. “We are carefully watching the growing militarization of Europe,” he said. “Is all of this just words or is it time for us to take countermeasures? No one should have doubt that Russia’s countermeasures will not take a long time to come.” At the European summit leaders were expected to discuss several measures intended to protect the continent’s skies, including a flagship initiative. This initiative would not be a physical wall, but instead a layered network of detection and interception systems, building on individual EU members’ anti-drone capabilities. Europe has been on high alert in recent weeks due to a string of drone sightings, as well as alleged incursions by Russian drones into NATO airspace over Poland and Romania, and the alleged by Russian fighter jets. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that while authorities cannot conclude who was behind the drone sightings in Denmark, “we can at least conclude that there is primarily one country that poses a threat to Europe’s security – and that is Russia.” The Kremlin has previously denied involvement in the drone sightings, as well as that it violated Estonian airspace.

{"content": "French Prime Minister on Sunday named Roland Lescure, a close ally of French President Emmanuel Macron, as finance minister in a new cabinet that saw several senior ministers in the last ousted government retain their posts. Lescure, who was swift to rally behind Macron when he first ran for the presidency in 2017, briefly spent time inside the Socialist Party early in his career. His nomination was widely seen as a gesture to the left ahead of further delicate cross-party budget negotiations. Budget talks have grown increasingly fraught, requiring delicate trade-offs between three ideologically opposed blocs – Macron’s ruling centrist minority, the far right and the left. Lecornu’s two predecessors, Francois Bayrou and Michel Barnier, were brought down by parliament over efforts to rein in France’s public spending at a time when ratings agencies and investors are closely watching the country’s deficit, the largest in the euro zone. “This is Bayrou’s government without Bayrou, and will implement the same policies,” hard-left lawmaker Eric Coquerel told BFM TV. Former finance minister Bruno Le Maire, who oversaw France’s “whatever it costs” response to the COVID pandemic, was appointed defense minister. He will now shape French thinking on how Europe should bolster European security as US President Donald Trump demands the European Union do more to support . “The choice of this identical government, seasoned with the man who bankrupted France, is pathetic,” far-right leader Marine Le Pen said on X, referring to France’s surging deficit during Le Maire’s tenure at the finance ministry. “We are utterly dismayed.” Several key ministers remained in their post, including Jean-Noel Barrot at the foreign ministry, Bruno Retailleau at the interior ministry and Gerald Darmanin at the justice ministry. Lescure, 58, will face a tough balancing act: securing either support or abstention from the Socialists, while preserving Macron’s pro-business legacy and keeping conservatives and liberals on board. The Franco-Canadian and former senior executive at Natixis Asset Management will also need to be mindful of the far right’s budget sensitivities given their readiness to try collapsing the government once more. In a bid to win over the Socialists, Lecornu has proposed a wealth tax long demanded by the left, while excluding business owners’ assets to shield companies and jobs.

{"content": "The US Coast Guard is buying four icebreaker ships from Finland, further bolstering America’s ability to put military assets in the Arctic at a time when Russia and China’s influence in the region is growing — and as experts have worried the US is not moving quickly enough. The agreement, formally unveiled Thursday to coincide with a White House meeting between US President Donald Trump and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, is part of a larger deal to use “Finnish expertise” to construct up to seven additional icebreakers in US shipyards, a White House official told CNN. The up to 11 total medium icebreakers are expected to cost around $6.1 billion, the official added, with the goal of the first being delivered by 2028. “The cooperation benefits both countries, Finland and the United States,” Stubb said in a post on X on Thursday, noting that he is “proud that Finnish arctic expertise is appreciated and trusted.” The Coast Guard, which operates American icebreakers, commissioned its third icebreaker into service in August this year — the first acquired by the service in more than 25 years. “What you’re doing is you’re going to be teaching us about the icebreaker business,” Trump said when reporters were invited into the Oval Office for a segment of the White House meeting. “By the time we finish, we’re going to make them maybe better than you, but at least as well, but probably not better, but at least as well.” Stubbs noted during the meeting that Trump had raised the issue of icebreakers when they first talked months ago. “I remember the first conversation we had, you know, you mentioned the fact that Russia has 40 and you need to start ramping this up,” he said. “And this is an indication that we’re going to do it and we’re going to do it together.” Finland’s expertise in the Arctic — a significantly strategic important region for the United States and for NATO more broadly — was a key benefit to having Finland join NATO in 2023, Iris Ferguson, formerly the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Arctic and global resilience under the Biden administration, told CNN. “The Arctic know-how, the border with Russia, the knowledge of Russia and their intentions and motivations, how they’ve strategically planned not only around capabilities like icebreakers, but also ground warfare, cyber warfare — they bring a lot of capabilities to bear that are useful for the Alliance and for the United States in the Arctic and more broadly,” Ferguson, who is currently a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. Ferguson said the two older US icebreakers – a heavy icebreaker and a medium icebreaker — are often in and out of maintenance. China, meanwhile, has five medium icebreakers, Ferguson said, and Russia has “the most icebreakers of any nation” with eight nuclear heavy icebreakers and dozens more medium style vessels. Stubbs put the total at 40 during the oval office meeting. The push to increase the US’ presence in the Arctic has been top of mind for years, particularly as China and n to the region. The Pentagon’s 2024 Arctic Strategy noted that major geopolitical changes – including the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO and growing collaboration between Russia and China – are demanding a strategy shift from the US. “This increasingly accessible region is becoming a venue for strategic competition, and the United States must stand ready to meet the challenge alongside Allies and partners,” then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote in the strategy report. The US has a number of military bases in the Arctic, including joint Army-Air Force base Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson which is a strategically critical base for the US military in the Pacific, Army base Fort Wainwright, Eielson Air Force Base, Space Force base Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, and several Coast Guard facilities. Ferguson said that the attention from Trump on the icebreaker issue and the Arctic more broadly is “a really big deal” for a region that can often be overlooked by Washington-based officials. Still, she said, there is more work to be done to ensure recent efforts materialize and are effective. “I think the challenge will be in implementation. It’s going to be really hard to have the right personnel to ensure that budgets don’t just wildly explode with timelines,” she said, “because we haven’t done this recently.”", "tags": ["competition", "ships", "trump", "strikes", "arctic", "icebreaker", "grows"]},

Husamettin Dogan, sentenced to nine years in prison last December, denies he intended to rape He argues that he was deceived by Dominique Pelicot, Gisele Pelicot’s ex-husband, who drugged his wife and offered her to strangers online before filming the assaults. The 44-year-old construction worker went on trial Monday in Nimes, in southern France, on charges of aggravated rape by administering substances that impair judgment or self-control, an offense carrying up to 20 years in prison. He remains free pending the verdict. Prosecutors had sought 12 years at his first trial, but imposed nine. Wearing a pink jacket, Pelicot entered the courthouse under police escort, smiling as she shook hands with supporters who shouted “Thank you!” and other words of encouragement. In the original proceedings, Pelicot’s ex-husband and 50 other men were convicted of sexually assaulting her between 2011 and 2020 while she was under chemical submission. Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison, while sentences for other defendants ranged from three to 15 years imprisonment. The trial drew international attention after Gisèle Pelicot opposed a closed hearing, a demand made by several defendants. The court sided with her. The evidence included stomach-churning homemade videos of the abuse that Dominique Pelicot filmed in the couple’s home in the small Provence town of Mazan and elsewhere. “I have nothing to be ashamed of. Shame must change sides,” she said on the trial’s opening day. After the verdict, she declared she had “never regretted that decision” and thanked supporters who gave her the “strength” to return to court each day. Pelicot has since become a symbol of the fight against sexual violence and the shocking case spurred a national reckoning over rape culture in France. Dominique Pelicot admitted his role and did not appeal his 20-year prison sentence, now final. He is expected to testify during the appeals hearing after being implicated by the remaining defendant. Of the 51 convicted men, 17 initially filed appeals. Most of those were withdrawn and only Dogan pursued his appeal.

{"content": "Imagine this: every day, you wake up in a motorhome in an unfamiliar part of the country in the early hours of the morning, and after cramming down as much oatmeal as can muster, you start on the day’s adventure – cycling the equivalent of a grueling stage, and then, armed with crampons, an ice axe and a rope, running and climbing the equivalent of a marathon up one of the United States’ highest mountains. After spending the day (and night) scrambling up ice encrusted slabs, dirt tracks, glaciated terrain and exposed rock, and battling exhaustion after being on the move for 18 hours, you allow yourself no more than five hours of sleep, because tomorrow, you’re doing it all over again. And again. And again. This is what Spanish ultrarunner has been doing for a month after challenging himself to ascend and link up all of the USA’s Fourteeners – mountains at least 14,000 feet in height – in the lower 48 US states. The journey – which he dubbed “ ” – saw him connect 72 peaks across mountain ranges in Colorado, California, and Washington, almost 3,198 miles and climbing 403,638 ft in 31 days, through blistering heat and frigid temperatures. This included about 629 miles traveled on foot and 2,568 miles by bike. On average, the Spaniard traveled roughly 103 miles and 13,021 feet per day in his challenge. This epic display of endurance, which Jornet completed all by human power – running, hiking, mountaineering or cycling the entire time, even for the journey between the peaks – was just the Spanish athlete’s latest foray into exploration. Last year, he successfully climbed all 82 of the ’ 4,000-meter (about 13,123 feet) peaks in record time, taking just 19 days to complete the remarkable feat, which was also human powered. “I was kind of in a no-fault zone, where every mistake I could make, I would die. And that, for like, 14, 17, 18 hours every day, was so mentally draining, day after day after day,” Jornet told CNN Sports about last year’s challenge. But still, this year, the Catalan set himself an even more audacious task. Starting at Longs Peak in Colorado, he made his way up the state’s 56 Fourteeners, before heading to California’s Sierra Nevada, and then to Washington’s imposing volcanoes. “What inspires me the most? It’s exploration, and that exploration is both geographical (and) geological … to explore the mountains and to explore the different regions, and also like the people that are living there, the creatures,” he told . “And then also like inner exploration to try to see, ‘What are my limits?’” he added. Exerting himself for so many hours a day is something Jornet has been perfecting for years. The secret? “It’s just years and years of training. “It’s technical capacities that I have been working for the past 20 years, and physically just being capable of doing multiple days of 20 hours of effort – that’s something that helps the body to reach those capacities,” he explained. “It’s years of silent work that makes up the body, gets adaptations to then be able to do these things,” he said. “Putting the body to these extreme challenges … we can have a better knowledge of understanding who we are as humans.” Jornet, 37, is known for his speed and endurance: he has won several elite ultrarunning races, including four wins at the 100-plus-mile mountain race Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc ( ), and victories at the Hardrock 100, Western States and Zegama-Aizkorri. His won his first UTMB at just 20 years old in 2008, becoming the youngest ever to achieve the feat. He is also a four-time Ski Mountaineering World Cup champion, and to add another impressive feat into the mix, he summited twice in six days, without fixed ropes, supplemental oxygen or radio communication. Competitions are one thing though – setting himself such lofty endurance challenges are a completely different game. But having won more accolades than most athletes can ever dream of has allowed him the space to be more creative with his challenges, Jornet explained. “Doing projects like this, this canvas disappears and it’s just a blank page. You can really explore: what are those limits?” But for his latest project, Jornet was adamant: “It’s not about going as fast as possible. “I want to learn things on the way and and I think the pace of traveling by foot or by bike, it’s a pace that allows you to connect much more with the land and with the people than if you are traveling with a car.” After moving for over 488 hours, Jornet finished his challenge, which saw him draw a line across the American west. “We never stop because we have a failure… It’s always before we arrive at that point, it’s our perception that makes us stop. “We manage pain, and we get comfortable being in pain. We can push over some threshold that it’s telling us: ‘Just stop, stop, stop,’” he said. “To reach some degree of satisfaction, we need to go through this discomfort that it’s challenging.”", "tags": ["marathon", "france", "month", "day", "stage", "runner"]},

{"content": "French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned Monday just hours after he unveiled his new cabinet, in a shock move that plunged the country further into political crisis. The prime minister – a key ally of embattled French President Emmanuel Macron – had not even been in office for four weeks, meaning he departs with the ignominious distinction of being the shortest-serving French prime minister since the Fifth Republic began. It’s the clearest sign yet that Macron has run out of road. After five prime ministers in less than two years – none able to build a stable majority – the country looks exhausted and increasingly done with him. Public frustration over austerity measures and a government seen as detached from everyday realities has only deepened. Macron himself still seems unable to digest the outcome of last year’s parliamentary elections, which sent a clear message: France has moved on from Macronism. Lecornu said Monday he is having final talks with political parties in an attempt to stabilize the country, with a deadline of Wednesday evening. Macron vowed to “take responsibility” if the talks fail, sources close to the French president told CNN affiliate BFMTV. Lecornu’s resignation underscores the paralysis that has gripped France since those inconclusive 2024 elections left no party with an outright majority. ﻿Macron now finds himself cornered, with few good options left; call a snap election or step down and trigger a new presidential election. Most expect him to opt for parliamentary elections – the lesser of several political risks. Some, however, point to a third path, appointing another prime minister this time from the left or the far right in a bid to rebuild an alliance. But after so many failed experiments in coalition, it’s unclear whether anyone still can. In a government reliant on fragile coalitions, every cog mattered. Barely 12 hours after announcing a cabinet that largely retained the same ministers, Lecornu faced backlash across the political spectrum, condemned by the both the left and the right, which had made significant gains in the last election. Lecornu had taken weeks to announce his chosen ministers, in what many assumed was an effort to present a more diverse, politically representative line-up. Speaking on Monday, he blamed a lack of compromise among parliamentary parties on his government’s collapse. He said that the “break” he had offered – his pledge to no longer use clause 49.3 of the French constitution to force through legislation without a vote – was insufficient for the other parties. “We didn’t need much to get there,” Lecornu said of negotiations with other parties to chart a path towards a workable government, adding that a lack of humility and “certain egos” got in the way. “There are lots of red lines in the mouths of some” but “there were rarely any green lines,” he added. “You can’t be prime minister when the conditions simply aren’t there,” Lecornu said. “Political parties keep acting as if each of them held a majority in the National Assembly.” Bruno Retailleau, leader of the Republicans – the traditional party of the French political right – who kept his post as interior minister in Lecornu’s government, reacted in outrage at his former colleague’s selection of ministers. “The composition of the government does not reflect the promised break,” he posted on X on Sunday night, referring to Lecornu’s promise to change direction from previous governments since the 2024 elections, which had leaned heavily on Macron party loyalists. Sunday’s cabinet was made up of 10 ministers from Macron’s party, even more than in Macron’s first government when he swept to power in 2017 with a new centrist party. Of its 15 ministers, Sunday’s cabinet featured no representation from the left-wing bloc or far-right party in the French parliament. Retailleau’s sentiment was echoed by the French far-right. “We said it clearly to the prime minister: it’s a break or it’s no confidence,” Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally, posted on X on Sunday night. Bardella blamed Macron for the government collapse, accusing him of choosing the cabinet and adding that Lecornu had no “margin of maneuver.” He called for the dissolution of the French parliament. ﻿“We’re at the end of the road, there’s no solution” Marine Le Pen, figurehead of the French far-right, said Monday. “We’re at the end of the joke,” she said, when asked if she could support another Macronist prime minister. There was plenty of anger on the left too. “This ephemeral government only shows one thing: Macronism plunges the country once again in chaos,” declared the spokesperson of France’s Socialist Party Arthur Delaporte Monday morning on X. Particular ire was directed at the appointment of former Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire to Lecornu’s former post heading up the French defense ministry. Le Maire had overseen a drastic spike in the national deficit during the Covid-19 pandemic. The French political instability is bad news for the country’s economy. The Paris stock exchange tumbled 1.7% on opening Monday morning, with concern growing over the upcoming budget. Already labored by national debt levels around double the European target, in September the French economy was downgraded by credit ratings agency Fitch. The government was due to submit a draft budget next week – a deadline that now looks impossible to meet. Without emergency legislation, missing the budget deadline could set France on a course towards a US-style budget shutdown, although that is still several months away. Ludovic Subran, chief investment officer of Allianz, told CNN that he doesn’t think that Monday’s government collapse will have a major macroeconomic impact. Subran said that, without a prime minister, there’s a higher chance of having a continuation budget for 2026, without a major change in the country’s economic direction or a solution to its fiscal woes. “﻿I say it’s not a big change,” he said. “It’s even more of a standstill economic framework with even less room to maneuver. So by now it’s almost sure that next year will look a lot more complicated.” Yields on French government bonds – or the interest rate demanded by investors – have risen above those of Spanish, Portuguese and Greek bonds, which were once at the heart of the eurozone debt crisis. The bond yield Monday was at its highest level in 10 years.", "tags": ["france", "month", "job", "prime", "resigns", "minister"]},

The statement said McCain, 71, is expected to make a “full recovery” and will be traveling from Rome, where the WFP is based, to Arizona to focus on her recuperation. She will return to her post after her doctors have cleared her in four to six weeks. “I want to thank the medical staff in Italy for the excellent treatment I received,” said McCain. “My recovery is progressing well thanks to their outstanding care.” McCain was appointed in March 2023 to lead the world’s largest humanitarian organization after serving as US ambassador to the UN agencies for food and agriculture under former President Joe Biden. McCain broke with Republicans when she endorsed Biden for president in 2020, making her a key surrogate for the Democrat after now-President Donald Trump spent years criticizing her husband and his military service. She has since become the face of the World Food Program, one of the few UN agencies that has received bipartisan support for its efforts to help nearly 150 million people confronting conflicts, disasters and impacts of climate change this year. McCain and the WFP have been in the spotlight as the agency has sought to respond to the humanitarian crises caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and Israel’s offensive inside the Gaza Strip. In late August, after visiting Gaza, McCain told The Associated Press it was “very evident” that there isn’t . She said she had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister about the urgent need for more aid.

{"content": "Former FBI Director James Comey wasn’t always atop President Donald Trump’s enemies list. “You’ve had one heck of a year,” Trump, then the president-elect, said to Comey in January 2017, the first time they met face-to-face privately at Trump Tower in New York. Trump told Comey he had a “great reputation”  and handled the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server “honorably,” according to Comey’s re-telling of their meeting in his 2018 memoir. That might have been the high point of their relationship. Moments later, the FBI director told Trump for the first time about the infamous “Steele dossier,” which alleged that Trump and his campaign colluded with the Russians to win the 2016 election. It was a conversation that would ultimately send Comey spiraling down the path to becoming one of Trump’s chief villains. Now, Comey is caught in the middle of Trump’s second-term retribution campaign, after he was with a two-count criminal indictment for allegedly lying to Congress in 2020 about leaks, which CNN has appears to be related to the FBI’s Clinton email investigation. Comey, who has said he is “innocent” of the charges, pleaded not guilty at in Virginia Wednesday morning. A judge set his trial date for January 5, 2026. Along the way, unlike his recent FBI predecessors, Comey forged an unprecedented decade-long path to becoming a major political actor, whose every action is weaponized by partisans from both sides for their own gain. He went from a Democratic scapegoat for the party’s 2016 election loss, to a catalyst for the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, to a prominent anti-Trump resistance figure, and now, a criminal defendant. “Trump is the ultimate pugilist and Comey is his punching bag, because Comey pricks away at Trump’s ego and paranoia,” said Douglas Brinkley, CNN Presidential Historian and a history professor at Rice University. “History will look at them both with jaded eyes, over the fact that these two grown-ups put their country through so many nauseating news cycles of schoolyard one-upmanship.” Here are the key moments that define the long and winding Trump-Comey grudge: Many Americans had probably never heard of Jim Comey before July 5, 2016. That’s when – in the heat of a presidential campaign, with the party conventions just weeks away – Comey held an unprecedented 15-minute press conference explaining the results of the FBI’s into Hillary Clinton’s email server. Comey blasted Clinton for being with classified emails and said she “should have known” not to use a private server. But evidence of criminal intent was so lacking, he concluded, that “no reasonable prosecutor” would indict the Democratic nominee. This was unheard of. Investigators rarely announce when an investigation doesn’t lead to charges. And it’s even less common for the FBI chief to publicly criticize a major political figure. Comey said he was providing this “unusual transparency” because “the American people deserve those details, in a case of intense public interest.” Both sides were instantly enraged. Trump , saying it proved “the system is rigged.” And Clinton was livid that Comey veered from FBI norms of saying nothing publicly when an investigation ends without any charges. For the next few months, Trump and Clinton duked it out on the campaign trail. Then, in late October, Comey , telling Congress in a letter that the FBI was re-opening the Clinton probe after discovering new emails that belonged to her. at the time that Comey’s move, which was as a potentially game-changing “October surprise,” reinvigorated Trump’s flailing campaign. (Some nonpartisan polling experts like Nate Silver that it probably cost Clinton the election.) After the letter, Trump’s past attacks predictably turned into praise. (He said Comey had “a lot of guts.”) But that, too, was short-lived: One week later – a mere 48 hours before Election Day – Comey said the FBI was finished reviewing the new Clinton emails and its view that charges weren’t warranted. Brian Fallon, the Clinton campaign’s top spokesman, recently told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that he for Trump’s 2016 victory but that he believes the charges against him are a “bone-chilling abuse of power.” “There’s plenty of us that, to this day, feel that, but for the letter that Jim Comey sent to the Hill inappropriately about her email server, 11 days prior to the election, that the election outcome might have gone differently,” Fallon said. “There are plenty of people on our side of the aisle that are not fans of Jim Comey. And yet, none of that … justifies what has happened.” After the 2016 election, Comey was faced with even thornier political problems: The FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s suspicious ties to Russia, and how to handle a related dossier with salacious allegations involving the president-elect. Two weeks before his swearing in, at Trump Tower by a wider group of US intelligence leaders about their findings that Russia meddled to help him win the election. Comey asked to speak alone with the president-elect about an even more sensitive matter. “As I spoke, I felt a strange out-of-body experience, as if I were watching myself speak to the new president about prostitutes in Russia,” Comey recalled in his 2018 book, referring to a salacious and in the dossier. “Before I finished, Trump interrupted sharply, with a dismissive tone. He was eager to protest that the allegations weren’t true.” Just two days after Trump was sworn into office, Comey had a fateful and unsolicited embrace in the White House with the president during a gathering of law enforcement to thank them for their work on the inauguration. The would be replayed over and over again whenever Comey was back in the news. Trump spotted Comey and called out for him. “He’s become more famous than me,” Trump said as Comey walked across the room and awkwardly shook hands with Trump, who leaned in to embrace his FBI director. Trump’s with Comey continued, much to the chagrin of the FBI director, who began documenting them by writing memos of the conversations afterward. At a January 2017 dinner, Trump told Comey, “I need loyalty. I expect loyalty,” Comey would later recall. The FBI director eventually responded he would provide “honesty” to the president. The next month, after Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn because of the rapidly escalating Russia scandal, Trump asked to speak alone with Comey following a counterterrorism briefing. Trump said of the FBI’s probe into Flynn: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go,” according to special counsel Mueller’s . In March, with the Russia allegations swirling in the press over the beginning of Trump’s presidency, Comey had yet another investigative bombshell to reveal publicly for the first time, at a House hearing about Russia’s election meddling. “The FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts,” Comey said on March 20, 2017. Later that month, the president asked Comey in a phone call to “lift the cloud” of the Russia investigation by saying Trump was not personally under investigation, Comey would recall. Comey responded that he would “see what we could do,” which he later explained was a way of “kind of getting off the phone.” Instead, the cloud would only grow larger. Several weeks later, Comey was on the other side of the country speaking to agents in the Los Angeles field office on May 9, 2017, when the headline blared across a television screen in his eyesight: “COMEY FIRED.” Back in Washington, a White House aide had delivered to FBI headquarters from Trump, which stated he was firing Comey based on recommendations from top Justice Department officials over his mishandling of the Clinton email probe. But one day later, Trump revealed his underlying motivation for the firing. He in the Oval Office that he “faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” The next day, Trump went a step further in with NBC’s Lester Holt, saying he was going to fire Comey regardless of the DOJ recommendation. “When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.” Trump also to Comey on Twitter, “James Comey better hope that there are no “tapes” of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Comey decided to share the memo of his Trump conversation related to the Flynn investigation with his friend and lawyer Dan Richman, who shared its contents . “Now that I was a private citizen, I could do something,” Comey wrote. One day after stories about the memo were published, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced . Comey was invited to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, nearly one month after his firing. The June 8, 2017, hearing was a spectacle on Capitol Hill with anticipation rarely seen for congressional proceedings. The line to get into the hearing stretched around the Hart Senate Office Building. Hordes of reporters and photographers crowded in to witness Comey’s first public comments since his firing. Some bars in Washington, DC, even for Comey watch-parties. “I walked with the leaders of the committee down the long private hall behind the dais, turned left, and stepped into something surreal. I have seen lots of cameras in my day and heard my share of shutter clicks. Nothing compared to this scene,” Comey wrote in his book about entering the hearing. During the hearing, Comey recalled his conversations with Trump and the circumstances surrounding his firing. “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” of Trump’s threat. (There were .) “We truly did not know what he was going to say or how this hearing was going to go. In the end, 20 million Americans watched it live,” said Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “As long as I do this, I will probably never live through a crazier day.” The Mueller probe was in full swing by June 2018, when the Justice Department inspector general released a bombshell 568-page report that dragged the country’s attention back to the Clinton email investigation. The report was a to Comey, highlighting his missteps and blunders that the watchdog said were “extraordinary and insubordinate.” The report said Comey improperly shut out his bosses from key decisions during the Clinton probe and then flouted longstanding Justice Department rules on his own, triggering major fallout that damaged the FBI’s apolitical reputation. This included Comey’s press conference about the Clinton case. To Comey’s credit, the watchdog also confirmed what he said all along and knocked down an often-repeated Trump talking point: The report found Comey’s actions during the Clinton probe weren’t motivated by political bias. Still, Trump , tweeting at the time that, “Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the FBI.” Comey had been a private citizen for more than three years when he was called back by Republicans to testify before Congress on September 30, 2020. The Senate Judiciary Committee wanted to speak with Comey as part of its investigation into the FBI’s missteps obtaining a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant for then-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The hearing was part of an effort by congressional Republicans to discredit the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation into Trump and Russia — efforts that have continued into the second Trump administration with document releases from FBI Director Kash Patel and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. “We’re trying to find out as the committee of oversight at the Department of Justice and the FBI how this happened and to make sure it never happens again,” said then-Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican. Comey appeared at the hearing remotely from his home in Virginia due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a fact that would become relevant in his indictment nearly five years later because the case against Comey was prosecuted by the US attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia. The former FBI director gave no opening statement and defended the FBI’s Russia investigation in response to Republican criticism. “In the main, it was done by the book, it was appropriate, and it was essential that it be done,” Comey said. But it was a line of questioning from Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, that would — years later — become the most consequential part of the hearing, forming the basis of the allegations from that he lied during the testimony. Cruz raised Comey’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in early May 2017, one week before he was fired, when he said he had not been an anonymous source nor authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source. Comey responded to Cruz: “I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by what the testimony you summarized, that I gave in May, of 2017.” That short exchange — in which Comey reaffirmed testimony from three years prior — forms the basis of the current charges against him. The Justice Department alleged in its indictment that Comey “knew” during the 2020 hearing that he “in fact had authorized” an unnamed contact of his “to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation.” The indictment does not include any specifics about the leaks, beyond saying he had “authorized PERSON 3 to serve as an anonymous source in news reports.” CNN that “Person 3” appeared to be Richman, who was at one point during Comey’s tenure a special government employee at the FBI. After that Congressional hearing, and after Trump’s departure from the White House in 2021, Comey fell out of the national conversation. He drifted further into the anti-Trump “resistance” by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024. And he messages supporting FBI rank-and-file after Trump returned to power this year and started officials. It was obvious — from Trump’s — that Comey would face intense scrutiny from the second Trump administration. But he created for himself with a social media post in May. The showed seashells at the beach that spelled out “86 47,” potentially referring to “86,” which means to get rid of something, and possibly referencing Trump, who is currently the 47th US president. Trump and his allies, including right-wing outlets like Fox News, went into to accuse Comey of making death threats. He was even , voluntarily, a few days later by US Secret Service agents about the post. In response, Comey said he randomly discovered the shells, didn’t know what it meant, but said, “I oppose violence of any kind, so I took the post down.” The debacle added kerosene to Comey’s long-running feud with Trump, but Comey didn’t face any charges for what Trump claimed was an assassination threat. The criminal charges came four months later, in September, in a case that stretched back to where it all began: Clinton and 2016. “Trump is going for the jugular now with the charges against Comey,” said Brinkley, the presidential historian. “In a modern context, looking back to the turn of the 20th century, this is something vastly more authoritarian than we’ve ever seen. But you do see it all the time in unstable countries.”", "tags": ["comey", "trip", "james", "strange", "trump", "retribution", "donald", "campaign"]},

The New York Jets, Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City are still searching for answers, while Baker Mayfield looks like he’s solving every problem in front of him. Here are five things to know heading into Week 6. The Jets are the only winless team left in the NFL, and now they’re packing their bags for London to face the Denver Broncos. Aaron Glenn’s first season as head coach hasn’t gone anywhere near as planned. His Jets are the first team in league history to start 0-5 without a single takeaway. Not getting at least one interception or fumble in five games seems almost impossible – but somehow, New York has pulled it off. They’re more than a touchdown underdog against a Broncos team coming off its biggest win of the season, ending the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles’ 10-game winning streak. If the Broncos score 21 or more points Sunday, you can probably count this as another loss for the Jets; starting quarterback Justin Fields is 0-26 in his career when his opponent hits that mark. Kickoff from London is set for 9:30 a.m. ET Sunday. No quarterback has been hotter this season than Baker Mayfield. Not . Not Patrick Mahomes. Not Lamar Jackson. Mayfield keeps finding ways to win. four victories have come by margins of 3, 1, 2 and 3 points – and the Tampa Bay QB been clutch in all of them. Somehow, he’s tied for fourth in MVP odds with Los Angeles Rams signal-caller Matthew Stafford at 12-1. Through five weeks, Mayfield for 1,283 yards, 10 touchdowns and just one interception. If there were an MVP for the first month of the season, he’d have it locked up. His banged-up Bucs now host the equally battered San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, with both teams sitting at 4-1. One of them will leave that game atop the NFC at 5-1. Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City are off to their worst start (2-3) since 2021. But there’s no need to panic in Chiefs Kingdom. That season, they still finished 12-5 and made it to the AFC Championship Game. and company will spend the rest of October at home, hosting the Detroit Lions, Las Vegas Raiders and Washington Commanders. After a brutal, last-minute loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Mahomes said the team has “lost too many games already,” so the urgency is real. Kansas City hosts the 4-1 Lions on Sunday Night Football. No fanbase with higher expectations is hurting more than Baltimore’s right now. After getting on Sunday, the Ravens are 1-4. Lamar Jackson’s status for this week’s matchup against the Rams isn’t looking good, and the bye week can’t come soon enough. Injuries have piled up across the roster, and it’s possible Baltimore heads into the bye at 1-5. Yet somehow, the Ravens still have the best odds to win the AFC North – a reflection of just how weak the division has been so far. Football fans, rejoice! You get a two-for-one Monday night.

{"content": "“We are not at war, but we are no longer at peace either.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s warning last month might lack the fateful portents of Sir Edward Grey’s lament on the eve of World War I that “the lamps are going out all over Europe.” But they signaled a page of history turning amid a in NATO nations by suspected Russian drones and warplanes, alongside other threatening seaborne and cyber activity. For 80 years Europe considered its peace inviolate. Now, it can no longer be sure. The buzz phrase for a new age of uncertainty is the “gray zone” — a state in which nothing is black or white; neither fully at war nor at peace. Merz is not alone in his concern. Former NATO chief George Robertson, co-author of a British government defense review, bemoaned recent cyberattacks and warned civilian infrastructure was unprepared. “Can we imagine that it is just all coincidence that these things are happening, the sabotage is happening all across Europe?” Robertson last week. “We’ve got to worry about the gray-zone attacks. It’ll be too late if the lights go out,” Robertson continued. He asked his audience in idyllic Wigtown, in southwest Scotland, a world away from Ukraine’s war: “Have you all got torches with live batteries in every room in your house? Have you got candles?” Drone sightings, which closed mainland European airports and led to NATO jets being scrambled, exposed Europe’s lack of readiness after decades of strategic slumber and cast doubt on whether governments weakened by populist uproar can muster the political will to rearm. And there’s never been more uncertainty about the strength of US security guarantees to NATO partners. President Donald Trump claims, ad nauseam, that the Ukraine war would never have begun had he been president. But the new alarm is on his watch. Has his ambivalence toward the Western alliance, confusion about his red lines, and psychodrama of flattery and rejection opened the way to dangerous Russian adventurism? Growing tensions across the Atlantic have hardly penetrated America’s toxic political bubble. They have largely been overshadowed by the Charlie Kirk assassination; Trump’s deployments of National Guard troops to American cities; and a government shutdown. Russia has so far wisely not tested US security. But Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski drew an analogy for American viewers. “Every sovereign country has the right to deal with intruders,” he . “You wouldn’t tolerate Cuban MiGs over Florida.” Poland was shocked when entered its airspace last month. US defense officials whether this was deliberate. It hardly mattered, since this was one of the worst-ever intrusions into NATO territory. Notions of a mere mistake were undermined by . Copenhagen International Airport had to be shut twice in a week after mystery drone sightings, with Russia suspected. Denmark is a major support of Ukraine. Flights at Oslo Airport in Norway were suspended for a short time last month and again this week after drone sightings. Munich Airport for the same reason. On September 19, NATO jets intercepted that violated the airspace of alliance member Estonia. Concern is growing over Russia’s “ ” of aging tankers and other vessels used to evade Ukraine war sanctions. The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington reported this year the fleet was used for undersea attacks on cable infrastructure and sabotage and subversion. Russia has mocked European NATO members’ concern as paranoia intended as a pretext for a military build-up that it claims threatens Moscow. “I won’t do it anymore,” Putin said last week, with half a grin, and denied he had drones that could reach Germany, France or Portugal. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Monday that the origin of the drones was unknown but that he hoped the incursions would cause voters in France and Germany to turn against their leaders. “The main thing is that short-sighted Europeans feel the danger of war on their own skin. That they fear and tremble like dumb animals in a herd being driven to slaughter,” Medvedev said. Medvedev is more of an online troll than true Kremlin power player these days. But he is unrecognizable from the president who enjoyed a pally lunch with President Barack Obama at Ray’s Hell Burger in Arlington, Virginia, at the height of an ill-fated US-Russia reset. Presuming all these incidents can be attributed to Russian gray-zone warfare, what is Moscow’s military goal? “It looks very much like it is Russian. And they have a lot of reasons to want to do this,” said Kirsten Fontenrose, president of Red Six Solutions, which provides US-government-approved technical expertise on combating drones. “You’re testing the limits of NATO countries’ commitment to one another,” Fontenrose told Becky Anderson on CNN International. “We have this analogy … about boiling a frog in a pot where the frog doesn’t jump out to save itself because the water is boiling so slowly it doesn’t know it’s being boiled. This is like Russia slowly increasing the heat on NATO countries. How far can it push?” Russia is also playing a geopolitical game. “Right now, Russia is testing just how protected Europe is,” said Kristine Berzina, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “Is the European shift to harder power and defense real? Are the Europeans developing actual capabilities to stop Russia? And what is the US appetite for having Europe’s back?” Putin has long tried to tear divides between NATO members in Europe and between the US and the rest of NATO. This has especially been the case during the Ukraine war, when alliance members farthest from the battle zone seem less threatened than those on the old Cold War frontlines in Eastern Europe. And another potential goal of gray-zone warfare for Moscow, hinted at by Medvedev, is to spark alarm among Western electorates that may weaken political resolve to continue arming Ukraine. The West responded to Russia’s wake-up call by bolstering airborne defenses along its eastern flank. Britain and France both sent jets. Poland invoked NATO’s Article 4 to convene discussions on what to do. Top European leaders have spoken of creating a “drone wall” against Russian unmanned aerial vehicles. And in a striking inversion of the wartime dynamic, Ukraine — which now has the most battle-tested military in Europe — sent personnel to school some NATO nations in Russian tactics and capabilities. More broadly, member states handed Trump a victory at the NATO summit this year by promising to increase defense spending to 3.5% of GDP. The genius of the supposed Russian effort is that it managed to put its European foes on alert with comparatively little effort and expense. Majda Ruge, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, pointed out that Europe lacks an economical way to respond. “Using F-35s to shoot really cheap Russian drones has put on the radar of most European leaders that they need to be very quick in developing more efficient, and cheaper, technology.” But is all this really necessary? A few drones flying into NATO airspace have not killed anyone. Perhaps it’s better to turn the other cheek since a NATO overreaction — perhaps if a member state shot down a Russian jet — might risk the escalation NATO has tried to avoid for the entire Ukraine war. Such a view, however, underplays the fact that the gravest threat is not from drone fleets but from hybrid, cyber and covert warfare — which has also included vigorous Russian sabotage operation across Europe. Another issue is the US response, which would surely have been far more robust under any modern president but Trump. “Here we go!” Trump wrote on social media after Russian drones flew over Poland, behaving more as a bemused commentator than the leader of the free world. He later mused the incursion might have been a mistake. But at the United Nations last month, he suggested that NATO states should shoot down Russian planes, . Europe’s NATO leaders are therefore left trying to parse exactly how the president expects them to respond and how much the US would help. Trump loves to preserve uncertainty as a tool of statecraft, but in this context ambiguity could be dangerous, especially if it caused Russia to increase provocations based on a misreading of American ambivalence toward allies. It’s also hard to untangle Trump’s strategic intentions from his emotional gyrations of his relationship with Putin. Currently, he’s disillusioned that his friend snubbed his Ukraine peace effort, part of a bid to win the Nobel Prize. But he’s shown in the past, he’s susceptible to the Kremlin strongman’s manipulation. Europe’s steadfastness is also a question. Alarmed by Russian expansionism and Trump’s “America First” hostility, centrist European leaders have vowed to supercharge rearmament and to do more to defend their backyard. But a political crisis in France, the political siege afflicting Britain’s Labour government and political challenges looming for Merz will make it hard to raise cash from debt-laden economies and to ask for unpopular sacrifices from voters who’ve taken the US security umbrella for granted. A “kinetic incident” or sudden escalation involving Russia might be the only thing that ends up shaking complacency, Berzina said. “That is very frightening, because there have been long enough signs, and this war in Ukraine has been dragged on for long enough, and Russia has learned far too much in the last three-and-a-half years, for Europe to be as underprepared as it is.” Short-term preparedness is one thing. True security will only come when Western societies are hardened against gray-zone warfare, cyberattacks and hybrid tactics used by Russia and other adversaries. As Robertson said, “Defense is not simply a matter of the armed forces of the country. Our report says it has got to be an all-of-country enterprise. Everyone has to be involved. Everybody has to know what to do in an emergency.” Nicholas Dungan, the Netherlands-based CEO of strategic advisory firm CogitoPraxis and a member of the European Leadership Network, agrees with Robertson. “The problem is not entirely military and the response is not entirely military,” he said. “That response depends on the resilience of the whole of society including major companies which control the vast majority of the critical systems that allow our societies to function.” Dungan sees growing cooperation between military strategists, who are acutely aware of the risks, and the private sector, as evidenced by a recent NATO conference in The Hague focused on civil-military cooperation, or CIMIC. Russia’s threatening posture shows time is short. But perhaps it did NATO a favor.", "tags": ["war", "america", "—", "worries"]},
{"content": "Indonesian rescue teams are frantically searching for scores of young students buried for two days under rubble in Sidoarjo, East Java, after their Islamic boarding school on them during afternoon prayers. In one pocket of the mangled concrete of the collapsed century-old Al Khoziny boarding school, authorities located six children alive and were running food, water and oxygen to the trapped group. But in total, at least 91 people remain missing, Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Authority (BPBD) said late Tuesday. At least six have died, according to Yudhi Bramyanto of Indonesia’s national Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas), the AP reported Wednesday. BPBD earlier reported at least 100 injuries in the collapse. Indonesian officials have warned that time is running out to reach those still alive as the mammoth rescue operation entered its third day on Wednesday. Lt. Gen. TNI  Suharyanto, head of the BNPB, visited the site of the collapse on Wednesday to inspect the damage. Suharyanto was sent by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who also shared his condolences with the victims’ families. “May they remain strong and be granted patience,” the BNPB head said. The rescue mission will prioritize locating those presumed alive, Suharyanto said, but the bodies of the victims will be recovered in due time. “(The) evacuation of confirmed deceased victims will take place only after we are confident that those still alive can be safely rescued,” Suharyanto added. Laksita Rini, head of Fire and Rescue Department in the East Java city of Surabaya, told CNN that there was still hope as “once a specific location is identified, the chances of survival can be increased.” Rescue efforts are under further strain, however, after an earthquake struck the region of Sumenep, about 124 miles from the collapse site, Reuters reported. Authorities fear the impact of those tremors may have packed the debris tighter. The six trapped children were able to communicate with the team on Wednesday, and rescuers were creating “tunnel-like passages or culverts to save the survivors,” she added. Emi Frizer, an official from Indonesia’s search and rescue agency, expressed concern over Tuesday’s 6.5 magnitude quake. He told Reuters it is likely to reduce space for those still trapped and narrow the room for maneuver during an already complicated rescue mission. “How to hold on to the targets’ lives while still having the same access – that’s going to take us a little longer,” Frizer said. There are 15 locations that teams are focusing on, six of which are strongly suspected to still contain survivors, the head of Basarnas, Air Vice Marshal Mohammad Syafii, told local TV station Kompas. Without specifying the exact number still alive, Syafii said rescue teams have managed to establish communication with several trapped people. Desperate family members have gathered at the school in Sidoarjo, about 420 miles east of Jakarta, where a list naming the missing students had been posted. The students were mostly boys aged between 12 and 18 who were performing afternoon prayers in a hall on Monday when the building collapsed on top of them, according to the Associated Press. Holy Abdullah Arif, 49, ran to the school when he heard about the incident to find that his 13-year-old nephew was listed among the missing. “I ran around screaming, ‘Rosi! Rosi! If you can hear me and can move, get out!’” he told Reuters news agency. “And then a child was screaming back from the rubble, he was stuck. I thought that was Rosi, so I asked, ‘Are you Rosi?’ and the child said, ‘God, no, help me!’” “I don’t know how he’s doing, whether he can be saved, whether he’s dead or alive,” he said. About 300 rescue workers continued to try and reach those trapped on Wednesday. But efforts have been hampered by the instability of the collapsed structure, and there are concerns that using heavy machinery to remove the debris would cause the building to further collapse. “Rescue efforts are currently focused on manually digging holes and gaps to evacuate surviving victims,” the BPBD said. Video from the scene showed teams working under the building, carefully chipping away at the debris to find a way through the huge slabs of concrete and exposed rebar. Nanang Sigit, lead search and rescue coordinator, told the AP that rescuers had been running oxygen to those still trapped under the debris to keep them alive. He added that rescuers saw several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those who were still alive, the AP reported. “Although facing unstable building debris conditions and a lot of material at the site, the (joint rescue) team continues to try to evacuate victims prioritizing safety,” he said in an updated statement. Special units from the national search and rescue agency Basarnas arrived to help with the search on Tuesday, equipped with breathing apparatus, medical evacuation gear, and other extraction tools. Teams with the Surabaya Fire and Rescue department have also deployed heavy duty rescue gear including “a sophisticated search camera capable of detecting victims among the rubble, and a heart rate monitor that can detect the heartbeat of survivors,” Rini told CNN. More than 80 people managed to escape in the immediate aftermath of the collapse, and rescue teams have pulled a further 11 people from the building, Basarnas said. One person was found dead. Three people were pulled alive from the rubble Tuesday, but two later died of their injuries in hospital, according to the agency. An investigation has been launched into the cause of the collapse. A fourth floor of the school was under construction at the time of the collapse, Syafii said, and as the building came down, all four floors stacked onto each other. The prayer hall construction had been ongoing without a permit, the AP reported, citing local authorities. “This is a wake-up call,” said Indonesian Religious Affairs minister Nasaruddin Umar, who visited the site, according to Indonesian news agency Antara. “Many Islamic schools are built through community efforts without adequate technical supervision, which poses serious risks,” he said.", "tags": ["scores", "school", "collapse", "frantic", "students", "indonesia", "days"]},
{"content": "First lady Melania Trump said Friday that Russia has allowed eight Ukrainian children to reunite with their parents, following months of private discussions between Russian officials and the first lady’s office centered on children separated from their families during the war. The first lady revealed that she and Russian President Vladimir Putin have had an “open channel” of communication since she wrote him a letter in August about the impact of the war in Ukraine on kids. She said the eight children were all returned to their families over the last 24 hours, with a commitment that the two sides will continue to work toward reunifying additional children displaced as part of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This remains an ongoing effort,” Melania Trump said in a brief speech at the White House. “Plans are already underway to reunify more children in the immediate future. I hope peace will come soon. It can begin with our children.” The first lady’s announcement comes as the Trump administration, however, has cut funding to a leading organization that tracks evidence of Russian war crimes, including the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children. The Ukraine Conflict Observatory was run by Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab and established with State Department backing in 2022 “to capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.” The group produced reports on a slew of alleged Russian war crimes, including the extent of to relocate, re-educate, and sometimes militarily train or forcibly adopt out Ukrainian children. Their database included the information and identities of over 30,000 Ukrainian children who were allegedly abducted by Russia across 100 locations, according to a source familiar with the data. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for the alleged war crime of forcibly deporting Ukrainian children. As CNN reported in March, the administration terminated financial support for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory. Funding was that month to allow the repository of evidence on the alleged Russian war crimes to be sent to the European Union’s law enforcement agency, Europol. In June, a group of lawmakers called on the State Department to disburse approximately $8 million that the agency told Congress in late 2024 would be used to support the Ukraine Conflict Observatory’s work. Two congressional aides said at the time that to their knowledge, the funding has not been disbursed. The Yale Humanitarian Research Lab has raised enough money through private donations to continue their work until January 1, their executive director said, but they don’t know what will happen after that. President Donald Trump hand-delivered a “peace” letter on behalf of the first lady to . The letter did not specifically reference the thousands of Ukrainian children who have allegedly been abducted by Russia since the war began, but urged Putin to consider the impact the conflict was having on children in general. Putin responded to Melania Trump in writing, the first lady said Friday, offering details about the Ukrainian children in Russia and offering to talk directly about the issue. “Since then, President Putin and I have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children,” Melania Trump said. “We have agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all people involved in this war.” In addition to releasing the eight children, Melania Trump said that Russian officials have provided updates on the identities of some children and the social and medical services that they’re receiving. She added that she’s also pressed the country over those Ukrainians who were minors when the war started, but are now adults and still residing in Russia. Russian officials have agreed to work toward rejoining those adults in the near future, Melania Trump said. “My ongoing mission is twofold: To optimize a transparent free-flow exchange of health-related information surrounding all children who have (fallen) victim to this war,” Trump said, “and to facilitate the regular reunification of children with their families until each individual returns home.” In a social media post Saturday, Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said that his country is “deeply grateful” to the first lady for her “compassion and genuine involvement in the effort to bring Ukrainian children back home.” “Yet there is still so much work ahead. Every day, Russia’s war takes more innocent lives,” he said, naming seven-year-old Makar Dorosh, who was killed in an airstrike in Zaporizhzhia on Friday, as an example of this. “Thousands of others remain in danger: deported, trafficked, indoctrinated, stripped of their identity, or forced to live under constant threat of attack — all robbed of their childhoods,” he said. “Russia is the architect of this tragedy. And it must bear full responsibility for every life taken, every child stolen, and every childhood destroyed,” Yermak added.

{"content": "A rescue team crouched under huge slabs of concrete and corrugated iron as they carefully slid 13-year-old Syailendra Haikal to safety from the twisted wreckage of a ; a brief glimmer of hope in the middle of a disaster. Haikal was taken to hospital with moderate injuries, authorities said. But as the search at the Al Khoziny Islamic Boarding School in Sidoarjo, about 420 miles east of Jakarta, entered its fourth day on Thursday, Indonesian authorities made the agonizing decision to move from rescue to recovery. The excavation process has been purposefully slow to avoid further collapse, and rescue forces have worked in shifts to carefully remove the debris. Terrified mothers, fathers and loved ones have waited with bated breath, fearing the worst while praying for a miracle. Teams have for days meticulously tunneled under the rubble, crawling on their hands and knees searching for signs of life, knowing the unstable structure could again buckle upon them. Relief and despair have punctuated their daring rescue mission as they slowly extracted a small number of children, while desperate family members clung to the hope their missing loved ones might too be found. “I kept saying, ‘Bismillah (in God’s name), my child is strong, my child is strong, my child is strong,’” Haikal’s mother Dwi Ajeng Tyasusanti told CNN affiliate CNN Indonesia on Thursday from the hospital. “Haikal made it out…. His (injuries) were only on the face, just some bruises on his legs.” Haikal was among seven teenage boys pulled from a pocket of the collapsed school on Wednesday — two of whom were found dead. Hopes are now fading for dozens of their classmates who remain buried. At least five people have died and 59 were still missing as of Thursday morning, authorities said. Hundreds of people have crowded the streets near the disaster site, and families of the missing gathered at a nearby meeting point to wait for news and check a list of names pinned to a notice board. Among them is Umi Kulsum, 37, from Madura Island off the northeastern coast of Java, whose 15-year-old son Sulaiman Hadi was studying at the school when it collapsed. Sulaiman was in his third year of the Madrasah Tsanawiyah, or secondary school. “I still believe my son can be found alive. I just ask the rescuers to keep searching until they find him. He’s my only child,” Kulsum told CNN, visibly distressed. Kulsum, who works in the capital Jakarta, rushed to Sidoarjo after learning that Sulaiman was among the missing. The last time she spoke to her son was three days before the collapse, when he had told her that he felt happy, despite living far from his mother. Many of the students, boys aged between 12 and 18 from mainly lower-income families, were performing their afternoon prayers on Monday when the prayer hall collapsed on top of them. Another distraught mother told CNN that she has agonized over what her son may have gone through under rubble, and is hoping for a miracle. Yudhi Bramantyo, the director of operations at Indonesia’s national search and rescue agency (Basarnas) told CNN late Wednesday that rescuers have detected no further signs of life. “All victims who were able to communicate with the rescue team have already been evacuated today from two different search sectors,” Bramantyo said. Teams have swept the area with thermal cameras to check for any more survivors, to no avail. Officials met with family members Thursday and agreed to start using heavy machinery to remove the debris and recover the bodies. The use of excavators and other equipment was initially halted over fears it would cause the unstable building to collapse further, and Bramantyo said their use would effectively close the chance of finding survivors through manual digging or tunneling. Search efforts were further complicated after an earthquake struck the region of Sumenep, about 124 miles from the collapse site on Tuesday, and authorities feared the impact of those tremors may have packed the debris tighter. The number of people believed buried was revised down to 59, from 91, on Wednesday. But officials say it’s unclear what the true number is. School attendance lists and missing persons reports from families are all they have to base the number on. The boarding house is one of thousands of Islamic schools, called Pesantrens, across the Muslim-majority nation and construction work was being carried out on the building at the time of the collapse. Rescue teams had established communication with a group of trapped students on Tuesday, and had been running oxygen, food and water under the debris to keep them alive. Inch by inch, they dug a narrow tunnel — just 60 centimetres wide — to reach the group. At just before 3 p.m. local time on Wednesday, they managed to retrieve the body of one of the seven boys. Minutes later, Haikal was pulled out alive. His survival was credited to personnel who kept him talking and supplied him with food and water until he could be freed, Basarnas said. Over the course of the next six hours, teams stayed working in the narrow tunnel until all of the seven were removed. At 8:20 p.m. local time, a boy identified as Saiful Rozi was freed in a stable condition, according to Basarnas. He was the final boy rescued alive on Wednesday.", "tags": ["indonesia", "school", "students", "collapsed", "hopes", "classmates", "alive"]},
{"content": "The 82-year-old leader of the Unification Church was arrested in South Korea early Tuesday as investigators probe allegations that the church bribed the wife of jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol and a conservative lawmaker. Hak Ja Han the widow of the church’s South Korean founder, Sun Myung Moon, has denied allegations that she directed church officials to bribe Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee, and the lawmaker. The Seoul Central District Court approved investigators’ request for an arrest warrant for Han, saying she posed a risk of destroying evidence. Han did not speak to reporters as she arrived at the Seoul court on Monday for a hearing on the warrant request. After an hourslong hearing, the court issued its decision in the early hours of Tuesday as Han awaited the verdict at a detention center near Seoul, where she will now be held. The Unification Church had criticized investigators’ attempt to arrest Han, noting that she appeared for questioning last week while still recovering from a heart procedure earlier this month, and accused them of disrespecting an “internationally respected religious leader.” Kim was on allegations including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a legislative candidate. The lawmaker, Kweon Seong-dong, a staunch Yoon loyalist, who was arrested last week, has denied receiving money from the church. Investigators also last week visited the headquarters of his conservative People Power Party to obtain documents for examining claims that Unification Church members signed up en masse ahead of the party’s 2023 leadership race to boost Kweon’s candidacy. The investigation into Kim is one of three special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul’s new liberal government targeting Yoon’s presidency. The others focus on Yoon’s planning and execution of his short-lived martial law imposition on Dec. 3 and his government’s alleged cover-up of a marine’s drowning death during a 2023 flood rescue operation. Yoon’s martial law lasted only a few hours before the liberal-led legislature voted to lift it. He was impeached later in December and formally removed from office in April. He was re-arrested in July and now faces rebellion and other charges. Kim has been investigated over various criminal allegations, stemming from events both before and during her husband’s presidency. The suspicions include accepting luxury gifts through an intermediary from a Unification Church official who allegedly sought various business favors, including the church’s participation in a Cambodian development project. The official, who has been arrested, is also suspected of providing 100 million won ($71,800) in bribes to Kweon. Han was questioned for nearly 10 hours on Wednesday last week and denied the allegations against her in brief comments to reporters. She and her church have insisted that the arrested church official, Yoon Young-ho, overstepped his authority and acted on his own. Han is the top leader of the church, officially called the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, which her husband founded in 1954. A self-proclaimed messiah who preached new interpretations of the Bible and conservative family values, Moon built the Unification Church into an international movement with millions of followers and extensive business interests.

{"content": "It was 5-year-old Tod’s first time competing in a beauty pageant and the bright red interior of his ears turned out and popped against his black fur. The main stud for his owner, food vendor and farmer Thawatchai Daeng-Ngam, Tod was one of the competitors Monday at the annual water buffalo racing festival in Chonburi, a city about an hour drive from Bangkok. Formerly considered humble draft animals, water buffaloes have become prized show animals in Thailand. They are celebrated at the festival, held at the end of the 11th lunar month to celebrate the beginning of the harvest season and put a spotlight on the animals that once were vital to Thai agriculture. These days tractors have replaced buffaloes, once prized for their strength and ability to plow fields and transport heavy loads. If the animals are not competing in shows, they are sold for meat. Buffaloes were the main attraction at the fair in Chonburi, which kicked off with a parade featuring students performing traditional Thai dance. Some of the buffaloes wore flower crowns as they pulled traditional wooden carriages with wheels 2 meters (6.5 feet) tall carrying their owners and women dressed in traditional Thai garb. The festival also featured a race with buffaloes ridden by jockeys sprinting down a 100-meter (328-foot) track. Pitun Rassamee came to compete with his 3-year-old buffalo with white fur. The albino already had won local competitions and he hoped Lookaew, meaning marble in Thai, would place in the top five. There was good reason to be hopeful. Another albino Thai buffalo was sold in 2024 for 18 million baht ($672,000) after winning multiple pageants. The shift from farm animals to prized symbols has been a gradual one accompanying the mechanization of farming. Thailand’s water buffalo population was in decline for a time. But the contests have injected new interest in the animals, as well as a new industry enjoying government support. The Thai government designated a Thai Buffalo Conservation Day beginning in 2017 and local governments now provide breeding assistance to farmers. Thawatchai, the food vendor who owns Tod, said raising the buffalo for competition was only a hobby. He lets it roam freely on his family’s farm and was only at the festival to see how Tod measured up with others. On bigger farms, the animals are bathed every day and fed a special diet of corn, soybeans, bran and vitamins, explained Kijchai Angkhanawin, who works as a caretaker for prized buffaloes, He splashed water on the buffaloes he was overseeing at the festival, which stood at least a head taller and were bulkier than many of the other animals. They are judged on horn size, hoof smoothness and overall physique, he said. In Chonburi, the buffalo-centered events are not new, said Papada Srisophon, an assistant to the chief of a village near a livestock center where farmers learn techniques to raise the animals. “Each year it has become bigger and bigger,” Papada said, explaining the contests are an incentive for the farmers to keep raising the animals. “Without this activity, they won’t know what to do with their buffaloes, and they won’t be motivated to keep their buffaloes.” At the Chonburi beauty pageant, the owners and caretakers waited with their buffaloes in shaded pens. Fire trucks delivered water for the animals while festival visitors posed for pictures with the biggest animals and families with small children gathered in the stands. Caretakers then corralled the large animals into a designated pen where judges wearing bolo ties and cowboy hats inspected the contestants. Many of the owners entering buffaloes in the competition said they grew up with the gentle animals and still valued them, even if they could no longer be of use on the farm. “Although buffaloes can still work in the field, they cannot compete with machines,” said Thawatchai, whose family still keeps 30 buffaloes including Tod. “Buffaloes are still important to me. It’s like what they said: ‘People raise buffaloes, and buffaloes raise people.’ It’s like a family member.”", "tags": ["humble", "status", "thailand", "beauty", "animal", "buffaloes"]},

In our travel roundup this week, a Scottish hotel owner has invented “tourist plates” to combat the rise in dangerous crashes on his nation’s roads. Plus, why Google Maps doesn’t work in one of Asia’s most developed countries – and how a government decision in October might change that. It was a white-knuckle drive through Tenerife that inspired Scottish man Robert Marshall to come up with , an adhesive sticker travelers can put on their cars to alert other road users that they’re newbies to the area. “I was completely stressed, I was driving on the opposite side of the road from what I’m used to,” he says. “I couldn’t read the signs, but everybody was tailgating me. I shouted at my partner, ‘I wish these people knew I was a tourist, because they would just stay away from my car.’” In the Scottish Highlands, where Marshall owns a hotel, there has been a in the number of serious road traffic accidents involving tourists. There have been close to 50 deaths in the past decade on the A9, Scotland’s longest road, which has gained notoriety for its regular changes from single to multiple-lane highway.

In May 2025, Transport Scotland reported that the number of crashes involving overseas drivers on the wrong side of the road had increased by . “We are suffering from overtourism,” says Laùra Hänsler, a safety campaigner for the A9, who has been working with Marshall on promoting his T-plates. “The infrastructure is practically on its knees because we’re straining to cope with it.” The plates have yet to be officially endorsed by any authorities. When contacted by CNN, Transport Scotland said national driving standards, including the requirements for displaying vehicle plates, were a matter for the Department of Transport. But “as we understand it — as long as it’s not offensive, you can put what you like on your car.” The plates have been generating buzz online and have been a particular hit on TikTok. Marshall says he’s received orders for the £9.99 plates (around $13.50, of which 10% goes to road-safety charities) from as far afield as the United States, Pakistan and India. In a Facebook demonstrating other road users’ reactions to the T-plate, Hänsler says that she tested the plates by going on the A9 and keeping to a steady 50 miles per hour (on a 60 mph road). “I let the vehicles gain on me, and you had that couple of seconds and then the comprehension, ‘Oh that’s different, that means something,’” she says. The cars would then routinely pull back to give her space, for her safety and theirs. “That’s what it’s for,” she says. “On the A9, you don’t get the chance to have the split-second of a mistake. And that can cost you your life.” So why do 70% of the world’s countries drive on the right-hand side of the road, but another 30% drive on the left? In mainland Europe, the standardization of driving on the right began with the sweeping away of class distinctions in revolutionary France — the left had previously been the preserve of the carriage-riding wealthy. In America, it goes back to pioneers and their wagons, and an adjustment that over the vehicle. But fast forward to 2025, and we’re still solving navigation problems. Google Maps, for example, is a ubiquitous tool used by tourists to get around new destinations, as well as their own cities. However, the popular map application doesn’t fully work in South Korea, despite it being, by other measures, a tech-savvy and tourist-friendly country. It’s down to a decades-long struggle over a set of map data owned by the South Korean government, and geopolitical tensions have expanded to bigger questions of “digital sovereignty” and market dominance. A is due this October. In parts of Europe, are becoming a thing of the past — Scotland has announced that all of its centers will shut by the end of 2025 — but in Asian countries including South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, they’re enjoying a boom. South Korea had about 300 tourist information centers in 2015. Now, the number has more than doubled. “Asian tourists generally value structured guidance and interpersonal explanations,” Xiang Li, a Hong Kong hospitality expert, told CNN. “In contrast, European tourists are more accustomed to self-guided experiences.” Two American friends traveling across Europe went viral after one posted videos of the pair accidentally boarding a plane to Tunis, Tunisia, instead of “to Nice,” France.

The shallow 6.9 magnitude quake struck around 10 p.m. local time, just west of Palompon and close to the city of Bogo in Cebu province. Emergency services were scrambling to find survivors on Wednesday, with military troops, police and civilian volunteers carrying out door-by-door searches – aided by sniffer dogs, the Associated Press (AP) reported Civil Defense officials at both the national and local level said at least 60 people had been killed. More than 150 were believed to have been injured. The hospital in Bogo, a costal city of around 90,000 people, had been “overwhelmed,” Civil Defense official Raffy Alejandro told reporters. Pictures showed streets in the city littered with debris Wednesday morning. Workers were trying to transport heavy machinery to assist search and rescue efforts in a cluster of shanties in a mountain village hit by a landslide, Bogo city disaster-mitigation officer Rex Ygot told AP on Wednesday. In the town of San Remigio, at least 13 people, including three members of the Philippine Coast Guard and one firefighter, died when a sports complex collapsed during a basketball game, Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon said in a telephone interview early Wednesday. “Some churches partially collapsed, and some schools had to be evacuated,” Gordon said. “This was a sleeper,” he said of the late-night quake. “It crept up on us.” In Daanbantayan, just north of Bogo, the facade of the St. Rita Church collapsed and there was a large crack down the side of the Municipal Hall. “The current situation in Daanbantayan highlights the severe impact of the earthquake on heritage structures, which form part of Cebu’s rich cultural and spiritual identity,” Cebu Governor Pam Baricuatro said in a post on Facebook. Footage shared on social media from Cebu showed a fire breaking out at a mall due to the earthquake Tuesday night, as well as a badly damaged McDonald’s. Beauty pageant contestants were seen in another video running off the stage as the earthquake started. The Philippine Red Cross said there were reports at schools in Cebu of debris, cracks in buildings and a temporary power failure. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), which recorded multiple aftershocks close to the epicenter in the hours after the initial earthquake, canceled a tsunami alert for Leyte, Biliran and Cebu provinces early Wednesday local time. A minor eruption from the country’s Taal volcano, about 70 km (45 miles) south of central Manila, was also recorded by Phivolcs. It stated that the eruption produced a 2,500-meter-high plume that drifted northwest, but the alert level remains at Level 1. Governor Baricuatro urged residents to remain calm in a social media video, saying the presidential office confirmed to her it will send immediate aid to Cebu. “Know that the provincial government is doing its best. Help is coming,” she said. The Medellin municipality in Cebu added in its Facebook post that classes have been suspended until further notice, and work has been suspended until facilities and buildings are assessed.

{"content": "When Kim Chan-hoe goes to work, he locks the door and checks the security cameras to make sure no police are hanging around. He doesn’t list his full-time job when applying for bank loans, knowing they’d reject him immediately. He says he’s been reported to police so many times, and forced to pay hefty fines, that the officers recognize him now. That’s because Kim is a tattoo artist — a profession that remained illegal for decades in South Korea, despite growing rapidly in popularity. “When I walk into a police station or a government office, they don’t see me as a skilled tattoo artist — they see me as nothing more than a criminal with tattoo equipment,” said Kim, who has been tattooing for 17 years and owns Red Waikiki studio in Seoul. That finally changed on Thursday, when the country’s parliament in favor of a groundbreaking bill to legalize tattooing — which before, only medical professionals were allowed to do. It was been a long battle to get here, with similar bills failing to pass in years past. But this time around, artists were more hopeful — recently elected President Lee Jae Myung, the final approver in signing a bill into law, during a previous run for presidency to legalize the industry. For many outside observers, the ban may seem confusing and contradictory. Despite being an illegal profession, South Korea’s tattoo scene has flourished in the shadows. Top artists win awards at international competitions, and eager fans travel from overseas to get inked. And while the restrictions applied to tattoo artists, having tattoos is not illegal. When walking the streets of the lively capital, you’ll likely see many tattoos shown openly — especially on younger South Koreans, who are increasingly embracing the art form. The industry’s rise made the ban all the more frustrating for its practitioners. “Many tattoo artists are leaving Korea, applying for visas, and moving abroad. It’s because they aren’t being recognized legally here,” said Kim, who works under the name Sulhong — pseudonyms being a common precaution among tattoo artists wary of using their real names. “It’s been a tough situation, but…many of us feel like the end is finally in sight,” he added, speaking to CNN ahead of Thursday’s vote. “It’s a deeply emotional experience.” The ban dates back to 1992, when South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled that tattooing was a medical procedure — which, under the country’s Medical Services Act, can be administered only by licensed medical professionals. The ruling reflected popular opinion at the time, which viewed tattoos as taboo. Part of that negative association came from the medieval practice of using tattoos to during Korea’s Goryeo Dynasty. Perceptions began changing in South Korea by the 2010s as tattoos became more popular across Asia and the world, adopted by major Korean celebrities including singers G-Dragon and Lee Hyori, and Korean American rapper Jay Park. “We’ve received many requests from clients saying, ‘I want a tattoo just like this person’s,’” said Kim. For instance, he said, he’s probably done “close to a thousand” tattoos that were inspired by G-Dragon’s designs. As demand rose, South Korean artists — who had been quietly working behind the scenes for years — grew in prominence. One of the country’s most famous artists, who goes by the professional name Doy, has reportedly tattooed celebrities including actors Brad Pitt and Lily Collins. The industry has become vibrant and varied, with artists offering all kinds of styles, from American Traditional to watercolor — though South Korea has become particularly known for small, delicate “fine line” tattoos popular among the younger generation, said Sisi, a tattoo artist who works at Kim’s studio in Seoul. That diversity is clear even within their shared studio. Kim’s tattoos are neotraditional, a style characterized by bold lines and dense colors, often depicting animals like snakes, tigers or cranes; while Sisi’s tattoos are playful, depicting cartoonish cats and flowers with neon pinks and blues. CNN is identifying Sisi by the professional nickname she works under. Cosmetic tattoos, such as semi-permanent makeup, have also become popular. One tattoo dye manufacturer estimated in 2018 that 10 million South Koreans had semi-permanent cosmetic tattoos, while three million had permanent tattoos, according to South Korea’s . By 2019, there were an estimated 20,000 artists in South Korea doing permanent tattoos, contributing to an industry worth 200 billion Korean won (about 144 million dollars) each year, according to the But there are still some staunch opponents, especially among the medical community, that vocally protested the bill – which, according to Yonhap, would aim to formally license tattoo artists and require training on hygiene and safety. “This is an extremely dangerous legislative attempt which shakes the basis of the medical law and will lead to results seriously threatening the public’s health and lives,” wrote the Korean Medical Association, which claims to represent 130,000 physicians across the country, in an August as the bill began gaining momentum. It argued that tattooing is “considered a medical procedure” that carries the risk of serious side effects, and urged that the bill be withdrawn. For artists, the lack of legal protection brought daily risks and challenges so draining that Kim said he has “wanted to quit every single year.” Under law, the act is punishable by up to five years of imprisonment and a fine of up to 50 million won ($35,860), and police are obligated to investigate any case reported. But in practice, the ban is loosely enforced, said Kim, with fines usually ranging between one and five million won (about $717 to $3,590). Artists are largely allowed to continue working afterward. In many ways, it’s just a formality, said Kim and Sisi. But it’s also a constant – sometimes expensive – reminder of their status under the law. Kim said he’s reported about twice a year on average, with each case kicking off months of investigation. Sometimes multiple members of the studio are reported at the same time — by disgruntled clients, rival operators, or just critics of the tattoo industry, he added. “For example, there was a time when four or five of us were reported together, and we ended up paying nearly 10 million Korean won (about $7,170) in fines altogether,” the artist said. During one raid a few years ago, Sisi recalled, “the shop was running smoothly, and then suddenly someone pretending to be a customer turned out to be the police. They came in during a session, and several people who were working at the time got caught.” Artists also face other tangible limitations, like having to work out of discreet locations. Instead of having street-level storefronts and public signage advertising their shop, many artists work in studios hidden on the higher floors of buildings. It’s common for studios not to accept credit card payments from clients, to stay under the radar. When filling out official paperwork or applying for loans, “most people would probably write ‘freelancer’ instead (as their profession),” knowing they’d be turned away if they admitted being a tattoo artist, Sisi said. These restrictions have weighed on the artists over the years. “Even while managing my team, I’ve faced situations where I thought, why am I doing this for a profession that isn’t even recognized?” said Kim. His prevailing hope lies in the pending bill. If it passes, besides removing the day-to-day barriers, “the most significant change is that we’ll finally be able to say, with pride, ‘This is my profession,’” he said. Once Lee gives the bill a final sign-off, the government will have two years to craft new guidelines under the law — potentially leaving the tattoo industry in the temporary gray zone of being technically legal but not yet regulated. Those regulations may include rules on hygiene and safety, required qualifications or certifications, and other protections for clients and artists. But Kim expressed confidence in the process, saying artists like him haven’t just been preparing for this moment for weeks or months — they’ve been waiting decades. “After nearly 20 years of doing this work, it feels like we’re finally being acknowledged for preserving and growing this culture,” he said. “Someone who draws on paper is considered an artist, and someone who draws on skin is also an artist,” he said. “But why is it that around the world, tattooing is considered art, while in Korea, it’s labeled as a medical procedure under the medical law? “That’s why we’re working to protect this culture — so that tattoos can be recognized as art.”", "tags": ["hidden", "south", "fines", "korea", "world", "raids", "illegal"]},
{"content": "A major fire at South Korea’s national data center has halted hundreds of online government services including postal and tax facilities, Reuters reported. The blaze likely began with an explosion of a battery at the National Information Resources Service in Daejeon city, about 85 miles (130 kilometers) south of the capital Seoul, at around 8:20 p.m. local time on Friday, the news agency reported. That led to a “thermal runaway” releasing extreme heat in the server room, making it difficult for firefighters to contain the inferno, officials told the agency. Prime Minister Kim Min-seok said the fire had “paralyzed” the government’s internal digital platform, shutting down its official email system and several websites. More than 600 online government services and systems remained down on Saturday morning, including a mobile ID system and online postal services. Kim warned that airport travelers who depend solely on mobile IDs could also face disruption, according to local media. Around 170 firefighters and 63 fire trucks hurried to the scene on Friday, with the main blaze under control by 6:30 a.m. the following day, reports said. One worker reportedly suffered first-degree burns to their face and arm while handling batteries, with almost 200 lithium-ion battery packs destroyed in the room, according to Yonhap news agency. The national data service acts as a cloud server for many government services and databases for the heavily wired Asian country, as well as data centers elsewhere. There was no estimate for when services would restart, the head of the data center, Lee Jae-yong, told Reuters at a briefing. The interior ministry said the government’s online platform for complaints and petitions was also suspended. Kim apologized on Saturday for the inconvenience to the public, and said the government would work swiftly to restore services. “There were difficulties in containing the fire because of the nature of critical government systems being concentrated at one site,” he told a televised emergency meeting.", "tags": ["explosive", "blaze", "battery", "services", "vital", "korea", "south", "paralyzes", "government"]},
{"content": "A dating show modeled on that features Pakistani contestants has sparked anger in the Muslim-majority country, despite no episodes being aired yet, and the series being only accessible on YouTube. The country’s broadcasting regulator said Saturday it was not in a position to act on the public complaints because it had no authority over the streaming platform. Lazawal Ishq, or Eternal Love, is hosted by Pakistani actress Ayesha Omar and filmed in Istanbul. Adapted from the Turkish format, Aşk Adası, and resembling the successful “Love Island” international franchise, it brings together four Pakistani men and women in a luxury villa where their every interaction is filmed. In Pakistan, extra-marital relationships are illegal, and there are stigmas around dating. Last week, Omar shared a teaser of her cruising along the Bosporus before welcoming contestants into the villa. But the promo quickly drew criticism online, with detractors labeling the format “un-Islamic” and accusing it of copying Western culture. The flood of public complaints about the Urdu-language show prompted Pakistani regulators to issue a clarification, saying they were unable to do anything. Muhammad Tahir, a spokesperson for the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, said Saturday that the program was neither being broadcast on mainstream media nor on any television channel licensed by the authority. “It does not fall within our domain,” Tahir told the Associated Press. “We do not regulate YouTube, and this content is not from any television channel. The general public is not aware that YouTube lies outside our regulatory scope.” The host, Omar, told the Pakistan-based Fashion Times magazine last week that the project was “a first of its kind for Pakistani and Urdu-speaking viewers.” She said the show would feature “love, bonding, and competition,” with audiences witnessing “every spark, every fight, and every heartfelt connection.” Over the course of 100 episodes, the eight contestants compete in challenges and form alliances until one couple emerges as the winner.

{"content": "For 48 hours, the Taliban appeared to turn back the clock in Afghanistan with a directive to , disconnecting millions of people from the world outside. Afghans lost the ability to contact anyone within or beyond their borders, sending waves of panic worldwide as families, colleagues and friends realized an entire nation had gone dark. Banking services froze, businesses ground to a halt, flights to and from major airports were canceled, money markets failed, and companies and aid groups lost contact with clients and staff. “The greatest despair was that people feared Afghanistan had once again been plunged into conflict,” reported Hewad Watander, a journalist in the capital Kabul, who uses a pen name to avoid Taliban retribution. “People appeared as if their spirits had left their bodies. Any sense of hope seemed to have completely vanished.” The unprecedented internet blackout came without public warning and was immediately attributed to an order from the Taliban, a repressive Islamist regime that has stifled personal freedoms, particularly those of women and girls, since taking power in 2021. Just two weeks earlier, Taliban leaders in the north said they had cut the internet to several provinces “to prevent immoral activities.” An “alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs,” said Haji Zaid, the spokesman of the governor of northern Balkh province. He said the order came from the Taliban’s Supreme Leader Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada, a powerful and reclusive figure who issues edicts from the southern city of Kandahar. No reason was given for the nationwide shutdown that started just after 5 p.m. on Monday. Nor for the sudden reconnection on Wednesday, leaving rumors on social media to fill the void. Afghans are starting to share the sinking grief they’ve felt over the last few days, as they realized there was no way to legally or safely get a message in or out. For many, it has only now become clear how much power the regime has to isolate them in their own homes, particularly women, who are banned from work, school and even some public places. For the Taliban, the episode possibly carries the lesson that attempting to turn back time on a population that’s grown up with the internet is much harder than just flicking a switch. On the US east coast on Monday morning, Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at Kentik, a network monitoring company, received a message from a contact that Afghanistan was about to go dark. Within an hour, he watched as data showed connectivity fall off a cliff. “It was just a wholesale disconnection,” he recalled. Internet watchdog NetBlocks reported a “total internet blackout” affecting some 43 million people. Afghans who were normally active on social media – Facebook, Instagram, X and TikTok – fell silent. WhatsApp messages sent from abroad remained unread. Local and international phone calls failed to connect. Taliban leaders said nothing. Members of the Afghan diaspora spent hours, and sleepless nights, trying to call and text relatives, friends and colleagues back home. Fatima Yousufi, a former player for the Afghanistan national soccer team who fled to Australia, said her family had been trying to reach her aunt, a single mom who relies on money sent from abroad to feed her four children. “We won’t know how she’s doing, how we can help her. Or how she can let us know if she needs money, or if she’s out of food,” said Yousufi on Tuesday. For many girls and women, the internet has become the only way to connect and defy the Taliban’s ban on education beyond sixth grade. Mati Amin, the co-founder of SOLAx, which educates Afghan girls and women via WhatsApp, said they’d seen a “precipitous decline” in lessons requested from users in Afghanistan. “We’ve got users in all 34 provinces,” he said Tuesday. “It’s absolutely clear that there’s not a single province unaffected.” Hamida Aman, founder of Radio Begum, which broadcasts in Afghanistan, said the station and all local radio had been cut off. Satellite service Begum TV, which operates from Paris, was still going to air. “Satellite TV remains the only window to the world now,” she wrote on LinkedIn on Tuesday. Internet connectivity is one measure of a country’s progress, and earlier this century things were looking up for Afghanistan. Money was flowing in, as the US and its allies attempted to rebuild civil society destroyed by the Taliban’s brutal rule from 1996 to 2001, even as fighting and insecurity still plagued swathes of the nation. Twenty years later, after the Taliban again seized control following the chaotic withdrawal of Western forces in 2021, many wondered how long the internet, and its vast well of vice, would be allowed to remain. But the last few days have shown that Afghanistan needs the internet. The blackout severely disrupted daily life, according to news agency TOLO News, which filed updates on social media. Images broadcast online show queues outside banks as customers tried to withdraw cash. Online payments failed; businesses couldn’t contact suppliers or staff. Abdul Hamid, a 37-year-old money exchanger in Kabul, said he wasn’t able to buy or sell currency because he didn’t know the rates. He told CNN he spent four hours in a taxi to get to the main market to check the figure. The next day he didn’t bother opening the shop, and instead sat and contemplated life with no income. Afghans desperate for a signal drove to the border with Pakistan, where it was possible to connect at the Torkham crossing. Afghan SIM cards and mobile networks seemed to be working normally, according to two Pakistani administrative officers posted there. Sabir Shah, an Afghan fruit dealer based in Peshawar, Pakistan, said he’d been unable to reach any suppliers in Afghanistan through phone or WhatsApp. Normally, large quantities of grapes, pomegranates, and apples are sent from Afghanistan to Pakistan, but payment systems had been disrupted, as well as communication. “It’s become very difficult for me to know how many trucks are coming from there and where I’m supposed to supply them,” he said.  “The Afghan government needs to understand that the internet and telephone are no longer luxuries — they are necessities of life.” Urgent calls for a reversal to the shutdown came from the United Nations, as well as rights groups Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Richard Bennett, the UN’s special rapporteur for Afghanistan, warned that disruption “may sink the fragile economy with massive human rights implications.” Sanctions, drought and the forced return of from Iran and Pakistan in the already impoverished country, from which international aid has been withdrawn in recent years. Still, in the cities, generations of young Afghans – including Taliban loyalists – have grown up with the internet. In 2025, the idea that people can walk around without any means to phone anyone seems completely foreign. “It’s a strange feeling to be without your phone,” said Maimoona Durani, a 33-year-old primary school teacher in Kabul, using an alias for safety reasons. “The phone network was also shut, not just internet. No one has landlines anymore but even those weren’t working. The inability to just pick up the phone and ask someone how they are or let people know that you are okay – that’s difficult,” she said. Samira, a 19-year-old student from Kabul, was in a religious education class on Wednesday when a cleaner entered the room and whispered something to her teacher, who ran out, and then came back minutes later, beaming with her phone. After almost 48 hours of darkness, the internet was back. “Some of the girls who had their phones in their bags began turning them on and they were all so happy,” said Samira, who uses one name for safety reasons. She didn’t have her phone on her, so asked to be excused early. “I walked so fast that I reached home at least 5 minutes faster than other days. On the way I saw almost everyone busy with their phones. Some people were talking on their phones and some others were scrolling,” she said. Fawzia Rahimi, 52, a housewife from Kabul, whose daughters live in the US, said she was sitting near the window with a headache from lack of sleep when suddenly her phone beeped with missed messages. “I picked up my phone and called my daughter on WhatsApp. It was midnight in the US; she was still awake, crying, because she hadn’t heard from us for three days. I can’t tell you how happy I felt when I heard her voice.” Rahimi told CNN that speaking to her family is the “only way to keep my days happy.” But beneath the joy and relief of reconnecting with family runs a deep undercurrent of anger that a basic human right of connection could be easily – and abruptly – taken away. Before the nationwide shutdown, Nigin, an Afghan artist, educator and activist, lost her internet connection in the north. She raced to buy a router so she could stay in touch with her students – and filed an essay for a special edition of the online magazine Usawa, warning that worse was to come. “The situation is beyond urgent,” , published last week. “We are on the edge of being buried alive.” When the internet dropped out nationwide, her editor Shikha Sawhney Lamba tried to reach her and other contributors. “They must have panicked,” Lamba told CNN from her home in Hong Kong. Nigin told her later that, yes, she had been alarmed by the cut but had resolved to check on her students. “I began walking, on foot, from house to house, crossing long distances… Wherever I went, I left a message: We continue,” she said in an Instagram message shared with CNN. “Seeing the pale, frightened faces of my friends and students filled me with rage. I made a promise to myself: Either death or hope.” Mariam Solaimankhil, an exiled former member of Afghanistan’s parliament, said the shutdown caused a lot of mental anguish. People had become agitated. Some had slid into depression. She said it was clear the Taliban was trying to remove outside influences so it could return to its brutal rule of the 1990s. “The more that they cut off the people, and the world, from Afghanistan, the more that they can do,” she said. “So, if a public flogging happens or someone gets killed, where’s the proof? It’s not going to be there anymore.” Some people inside Afghanistan managed to get messages out via Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet network – and as the days wore on, desperate families had talked about trying to smuggle in more Starlink units, Solaimankhil said. Starlink isn’t officially available inside Afghanistan, according to its website. CNN’s request for comment wasn’t answered. Tom Worthington, from the Australian National University’s School of Computing, said circumventing a shutdown that appeared to have been ordered by the country’s Taliban leader would be risky for ordinary Afghans. “If you’re engaged in a war against the Taliban, (Starlink) would be useful, but in terms of human rights, helping educate the local population, it wouldn’t be, because giving them the unit would place them in so much danger,” he said. Worthington said filtering “immoral” content from the internet – if that was the motivation – would be difficult for any government, given the volume circulating online. The popular use of virtual private networks also shows it’s relatively easy to reach beyond a government’s control – if the internet is working. On Wednesday, when the order came to reconnect, traffic surged beyond normal levels. Madory from Kentik, the internet monitoring company, said reconnecting would have been a manual process completed by fewer than 10 service providers. He has seen this kind of shutdown before, as far back 2011, when the Egyptian government pulled the plug on the internet during the pro-democracy “Arab Spring” protests. “That outage kind of ushered in this era that we’re in now where there’s all this government manipulation of communications,” said Madory. “The problem with that is that it’s very harmful to the government’s operations, the businesses. It really kills the economy.” Former US Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad seemed to suggest on X that not all Taliban ministers were behind the outage. “Even their own ministers are dumbfounded,” he wrote on Wednesday, before the reconnection. “I am not sure the leadership understood the consequences of its decision before taking it.” If the intent was to frighten the population, the move succeeded. Sahar Fetrat from Human Rights Watch said friends had told her the two days offline felt like living in Afghanistan 30 years ago. “Young girls have written to me that we should be their voice. (The) internet is the last thing that slightly changes their situation than those of prisoners,” she wrote in a text message to CNN. “They are worried this may happen again.” CNN’s Sophia Saifi in Islamabad and Esha Mitra in New Delhi contributed to this report.", "tags": ["shows", "day", "turn", "time"]},
{"content": "On a wet monsoon evening in Pakistan’s bustling city of Lahore, the generators sputter and the lights flicker in Maniax, a grimy but legendary gaming arcade powering the country’s unlikely dominance of a lucrative corner of the Esports world. Three out of the world’s top 10 players of the classic Japanese fighting game Tekken are from Pakistan. They’re cracking (virtual) skulls on the international circuit, filling the rosters of lucrative Saudi-backed teams and taking home tens of thousands of dollars in prize money. That’s a punchy statistic for a country better known for its recurring political turmoil and where a PlayStation or a PC costs more than the monthly average income. The electricity needed to power it isn’t always guaranteed, either. The first Tekken came out in 1994 and the franchise is now in its eighth installment, with millions of copies sold every time a new version is launched. Players choose from a stable of fighters including kung-fu experts, a space ninja and a giant panda, to punch, kick, chop and throw their way to a knockout. It’s not the most popular game in the billion-dollar Esports market, but it’s lucrative. In August, South Korean gamer “Ulsan” took $250,000 in prize money after winning the Esports World Cup in Tekken 8. Tekken’s champion in Pakistan is Arsalan “Ash” Siddique, a quietly assured 30-year-old from Lahore. He wore a squad shirt with his gaming name emblazoned on the back when he met CNN, at the co-working space in a leafy suburb of Lahore where he trains. The room was narrow but studded with his trophies, and on a shelf a golden console glittered among anime figurines. In a bustling market nearby, he featured on a billboard advertisement for a telecoms company. Ash, who practices eight hours every day, is a former ESPN Esports Player of the Year, and the first Red Bull athlete from Pakistan. He’s won five back-to-back Evolution Championship Series, tournaments held globally that focus exclusively on fighting games. On a ritzy August weekend in Las Vegas, he clinched his sixth EVO win, taking home $12,000 in prize money. That final in Las Vegas was an all-Pakistan affair, with Ash defeating his friend Atif Butt, with whom he’d spent weeks in the Lahore studio, practicing combos of punches, kicks and chops. But like many other gamers in Pakistan, their skills were forged in public arcades like Maniax. Playing Tekken in private means forking out close to $700 for a PlayStation – out of reach for most in Pakistan, where the average monthly salary is $300. Later that night in Maniax, disheveled gaming chairs were scattered about, and rainwater seeped in from the giant window. “Dil Se,” a popular Bollywood tune, played across the speakers as intent gamers pounded their consoles in the flashes of a thunderstorm. In a corner, a young man repaired and customized arcade joysticks, a precious commodity not available in the country and which retail at about $300. Bawaqar Haider, 35, who goes by the game name Soul Dagger, is one of the co-founders of Maniax, and has been a fan of Tekken since he was a kid. In his arcade, he says, “you basically have no discrimination … the whole arcade is mostly skill-driven.” Arcade culture has been the driver of Tekken’s popularity in Pakistan, says Butt – who now represents the Saudi Esports organization Team Falcons. The game was relatively easily available and cheap for arcades to install in the 1990s and early 2000s, making it “more easily available” to young gamers, he said. Haider believes Pakistan’s hardscrabble environment has created a “ruthlessness” among its young gamers. Most of the country’s under-30 demographic – some 170 million people – have grown up in the shadow of political instability and violence and an economy constantly lurching from crisis to crisis. Their desire to succeed in the arcades and at international tournaments stems from a “hunger and deprivation that drives them to surpass the world around them,” said Haider. Lacking a console at home, Ash started playing Tekken in the gaming arcades of Lahore, his hometown, when he was seven. He would spend hours there for days on end, year after year until 2012, when he realized he needed a new challenge. “I became kind of sad,” Ash told CNN, “because there was no more competition in Pakistan.” Wanting to broaden his horizons but with restricted financial means, Ash turned to his friends for help. They pooled money to help him pay for air tickets, but foreign travel came with other obstacles. Pakistan has one of the weakest passports in the world and Ash did not have the finances or travel history to get visas for countries like Japan or the United States, Esports hotspots that have stringent visa requirements for Pakistani citizens. It’s an issue that continues to frustrate Ash. After a spectacular victory against the South Korean national team in Seoul in March, he spoke out about the difficulties he and his fellow Pakistan gamers face when it comes to visas and making a career out of playing Tekken. “We cannot travel anywhere; sponsors are not sponsoring players because the players don’t have US visas,” he said. Not having visas is a “major issue,” Ash told CNN. “No matter how talented we are, if you cannot go outside, and if you cannot show our talent, it’s not worth it.” He also called for government support to create an ecosystem for Esports in Pakistan as he feels there’s “no infrastructure … not only for Tekken, for any Esports.” Ash’s concerns have not gone unheard. Rana Mashood, chairman of the Prime Minister’s Youth Program, told CNN that efforts are underway to formulate Pakistan’s first ever Esports policy which will include the establishment of gaming “arenas and coworking spaces.” While the tightly knit Tekken community in Pakistan has helped foster a strong foundation for young gamers, it is also mostly dominated by young men. Laiba Adnan, 21, is a female gamer who has been making waves in women-only Tekken circles. A huge fan of Ash, she doesn’t feel comfortable going to arcades. Adnan said she has high hopes arcades will become more “women centered” because of the path that Ash has paved. “I think Tekken has really changed the way a lot of people in the world see Pakistan. They now see us as extremely hard working … these are the ones who grind 24/7. You know, they’re a huge inspiration to me.” When Ash and his team beat South Korea in March, he made a viral speech to the cheers of “Long Live Pakistan” resounding through in the auditorium in Seoul. He called for “a new generation of Pakistani youth to pursue their dreams and showcase their talents on the global stage.” Smiling and sitting among his trophies back in his studio in Lahore, Ash is confident about what lies ahead for him and the players he’s inspired. “The future,” he says, “is bright.”", "tags": ["classic", "fortune", "fame", "ticket", "tekken"]},
{"content": "Spin Ghul’s desire for jihad started when he was a child in Saudi Arabia, where his parents had remained after traveling from Niger on holy pilgrimage. From his elementary school days, he was determined to become a religious soldier, especially after learning about the Soviet-Afghan War, and how the Islamist holy warriors — the mujahideen — were helping defeat the USSR in the bloody battle. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, many mujahideen joined Chechen rebels to fight for independence, Chechnya being a majority-Muslim autonomous republic. The First Chechen War lasted from 1994 until the Chechens recaptured their capital city of Grozny in August 1996, prompting Russia to agree to a ceasefire. Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers, Chechen fighters, and Chechen civilians were killed. In September 1999, the Second Chechen War broke out after four apartment blocks in Russia were bombed, which Russia blamed on separatist militants. Fueled with money and fighters from Arab countries, backed to a much greater extent than the first time around, this war lasted for a full decade and included Vladimir Putin’s bloody siege of Grozny. This was the battle Spin Ghul had wanted to join, and it would eventually set him on a path toward being part of an al Qaeda ambush against American servicemembers in Afghanistan in 2003, leading an effort to blow up the US embassy in Nigeria, and becoming the very first foreign terrorist ever tried in a US criminal court for killing US troops in a war zone. This account is based on legal documents from his 2017 trial, including a transcript of his 2011 confession before an Italian court, and multiple interviews with those involved in his case. Ghul’s early life had been bleak. The world of peasants — undocumented, essentially indentured servants — was even worse in Saudi Arabia for Black people. In 2000, a friend of his, Amran, who knew Spin Ghul liked military magazines, gave him one he’d picked up. The magazine had photographs of airplanes as well as a picture of the Pentagon. Spin Ghul took the magazine and asked his friend, “Where can we steal an airplane and go hit the Pentagon with it?” Amran took the magazine back from Spin Ghul. He didn’t give his friend an answer. He didn’t say yes or no. This wasn’t just a random comment, after all. Amran worked for the Saudi government, in an office run by a man named Suleiman. Suleiman was something of a neighborhood jihadi legend. He’d fought the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s and claimed to know Osama bin Laden. When Spin Ghul met him, Suleiman was still very much involved in jihad, albeit in a different role. Suleiman recruited and sent would-be fighters to sites of jihadi conflict: Bosnia, Chechnya, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Not that Spin Ghul had to be recruited for jihad. He was already committed to it. The magazine sparked the moment of action and set the plans into motion, but the desire was already there. Suleiman introduced Spin Ghul to a man named Mahir in the city of Taif, Saudi Arabia. Using his birth name, Adnan Ibrahim Harun Adam, and a Niger passport, Spin Ghul received a visa in Riyadh, and then he and Mahir, a fixer and coordinator, flew together from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to Doha, Qatar, then on to Karachi, Pakistan, and finally Quetta. From Pakistan, they drove a small car across the Afghanistan border. Mahir served as a liaison between Spin Ghul and members of al Qaeda. They didn’t talk much on their trip. Spin Ghul didn’t talk about his hopes for jihad or his plans until they arrived in Afghanistan and Spin Ghul joined a group of other wannabe jihadis who were hooked up with al Qaeda operatives. Spin Ghul was shuttled to an al Qaeda safe house near Kandahar, Afghanistan, in August 2001, where he and the new recruits awaited their next assignment. Day-to-day operations were run by three al Qaeda operatives: Abdul Fida al-Yemeni, Usaid al-Yemeni, and Abu Zubair al-Haleidi. At the safe house, jihadis would communicate with operatives out in the field and with informants from throughout the area. Of the three, Spin Ghul found Abdul Fida al-Yemeni to be the friendliest. Abdul Fida al-Yemeni had been in Afghanistan for a while already, having trained at the notorious al Farouq training camp. He told Spin Ghul that he’d met “the Sheikh,” the legendary Osama bin Laden, and the Sheikh had discussed a plan to attack America using airplanes. A few days later, they were all sitting around the safe house in September 2001 when they heard their friends happily shouting on the radio. They were celebrating, ululating, crying “Allahu Akbar,” because al Qaeda operatives had succeeded in hijacking four US commercial airplanes and flying them into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing thousands of innocent American civilians. Spin Ghul’s friends and fellow jihadis told them on the radio that they would record the news and bring the videotapes to show them the scenes of carnage. A few days later, they were loaded into a large truck and driven to a training camp a few hours outside Kandahar. It was the last time Spin Ghul saw Abdul Fida al-Yemeni, who would eventually be arrested by Pakistani security forces, and sent to Guantánamo Bay. It wasn’t clear what the plan was for Spin Ghul, though his impression was that he was going to be training in preparation either for American soldiers coming to Afghanistan or for an al Qaeda attack on an American ship, similar to the attack on the USS Cole, a suicide bombing in Yemen in 2000 that had killed seventeen American sailors. One day, a Toyota truck pulled into the training camp, driven by a man with a limp who was a top al Qaeda official. Other jihadis came and went. Senior al Qaeda operative Abu Faraj al-Libi was there, as was Osama bin Laden’s spiritual adviser Khallad al-Kuwaiti, long before either man was captured and sent to the detainee center at Guantánamo Bay. Spin Ghul had difficulty discerning who was with al Qaeda and who were just run-of-the-mill jihadis. Making these recruits jihadi warriors was, of course, the plan. The truck, Spin Ghul was pleased to discover, was headed for the infamous al Farouq training camp. Abdul Bara al-Suri was the al Qaeda operative who initiated the training of new recruits, explaining the rules and laws of the camp. Al-Mohajiri, a Yemeni man, supervised their day-to-day training, taught with new zeal because of the September 11 attack on the US. For a month or so, Spin Ghul and his fellow recruits were instructed on how to use weapons, mostly Soviet ones, Kalashnikov rifles and RPGs. They were also trained in small arms and Uzi submachine guns. They learned how to operate what was called a “Pika,” a PK light machine gun. They were shown how to use grenades. Realizing that his new path could quickly lead to death, Spin Ghul approached an al Qaeda leader named Abdul Hadi al-Iraqi and told him that he wanted to leave a wasiyya. For most Muslims, a wasiyya is their last will and testament. To Islamist terrorists, it often takes the form of a video message recorded in the event that they are killed, to be shown to their families and offering one last opportunity to preach their zealotry and damn their enemies from beyond the grave. It was the first time Spin Ghul ever recorded a video, and when he finished, Abdul Hadi al-Iraqi gave it to Abu Faraj al-Libi to send to Spin Ghul’s family should he become a “martyr.” By the time Spin Ghul began training at al Farouq in the fall of 2001, alumni of this al Qaeda training ground included Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-‘Owhali, both convicted in 2001 for assisting in the 1998 bombing of the US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; Saeed al-Ghamdi and Ahmed al-Nami, two of the four men who hijacked United Airlines Flight 93, which took off from Newark Airport and crash-landed in Pennsylvania; Wail al-Shehri and Waleed al-Shehri, two of the four men who hijacked American Airlines Flight 11, which took off from Boston’s Logan Airport and was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center; “American Taliban” John Walker Lindh; and “Australian Taliban” David Hicks. Recruits began by learning how to integrate into military life. Then they moved to training in mostly Russian-made weapons, available either because they were relics from the war that had ended in 1989 or were more easily trafficked because of proximity — Kalashnikovs, of course, but also AK-74 assault rifles and other variants, self-loading SKS carbines, RPD and RPK light machine guns, and more. From there, Spin Ghul and his classmates went to a new camp with more seasoned trained fighters. After passing through Kandahar, they were put into a car and driven to a safe house in Kabul, Afghanistan, then to the Malik training camp, where they were taught to use mines and mortars. Then they were taken to a camp called “Maskar 9” or “Camp Nine,” where they were instructed in how to take advantage of terrain and geography, as well as how to detonate TNT and other explosives. At Maskar 9, Abdul Wakil al-Masri was the commander. Indeed, he was the commander of all al Qaeda forces in the north. It was at Camp Nine where Adnan Harun Adam became “Spin Ghul,” or “White Rose.” A young Pashto cook gave him the name as an homage to a fallen Black fighter, a Somali killed during the war against the Soviets, to whom they’d given the name as an ironic twist on his dark skin. Al Qaeda was not without racism against non-Arab fighters. Less than a month after the attacks of September 11, the US began retaliating against al Qaeda and the Taliban-run government of Afghanistan for sheltering them. The American bombing campaign began on October 7, 2001, in Afghanistan, and that’s when al Qaeda leaders divided the jihadis in Camp Nine into two groups. Spin Ghul and his group of jihadis moved into a safe house in a small town called Angoor Ada, the site of a border crossing between Pakistan’s Waziristan region and Afghanistan. Abdul Hadi al-Iraqi would run this safe house. Day-to-day operations were run by an al Qaeda operative named Abdul Faras, who also taught military tactics. Another group of jihadis had already reconned the area, found a new US Army base, and attacked it with weapons and explosives. Spin Ghul heard about this battle and was ready to join the fight.", "tags": ["jihadi", "camps", "streets", "qaeda", "training", "arabia", "fighter", "journey", "spin", "al"]},
{"content": "US President Donald Trump all but nominated himself for the Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday, claiming in his address to the United Nations that he has “ended seven un-endable wars,” which “were raging, with countless thousands of people being killed.” “I ended seven wars, and in all cases, they were raging, with countless thousands of people being killed. This includes Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda — a vicious, violent war that was — Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan,” Trump said in his remarks. The two conflicts that Trump has so far put the most efforts into ending – Israel’s war in Gaza and Russia’s war on Ukraine – continue to rage with no signs of easing, despite the myriads of deadlines, threats and promises he has made to get ceasefire agreements. But the failure to get a deal in the Middle East and Ukraine has not stopped Trump from boasting about the conflicts he said he ended. Trump has repeated this claim since earlier this summer, and the White House provided a list of the seven claimed bilateral agreements last month. While he certainly contributed to brokering a couple of agreements between long-standing foes, his role in securing ceasefires in some of the other conflicts he has boasted about ending has been disputed by some of the countries involved. And then of course there are the wars that were not happening when he claims to have ended them. Trump certainly deserves credit for of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House in August, where they finalized a peace agreement, which they first . The two former Soviet republics had been locked in a conflict over for almost four decades. The breakaway region in the Caucasus Mountains was home to around 120,000 ethnic Armenians and while it is internationally considered as part of Azerbaijan, it was controlled by Armenian separatists since the fall of the Soviet Union. That changed in 2023, when a lightning 24-hour assault saw Azerbaijan regain total control of Nagorno-Karabakh, prompting the region’s ethnic Armenian population to flee to Armenia within a week. Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev both praised Trump for his role in getting the deal signed – even if he later, while talking about it, confused Armenia for Albania and called Azerbaijan “Aberbaijan.” While undoubtedly a step forward, the agreement has not been ratified by either country. Several issues remain to be resolved – most notably, Azerbaijan is demanding that Armenia changes its constitution – a move that would likely be rejected by Armenian voters in a referendum. The 508-mile (817-kilometer) border between Thailand and Cambodia has been prone to flareups of violence for decades. Cambodia has previously sought a ruling from the UN’s International Court of Justice over disputed areas, but Thailand said it does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction and claims that some areas along the border were never fully demarcated. The most recent round of violence erupted in July when at least 38 people, mostly civilians, were killed and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes. Trump held separate phone calls with the leaders of the two countries, threatening to stop trade negotiations if they didn’t agree to a ceasefire. The two sides met in Malaysia within days and agreed to a ceasefire. However, the conflict over the contested border remains unresolved – even though Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet said that he nominated the US president for the . When the US president between Israel and Iran after 12 days of fighting in June, it looked a bit premature as both countries continued with their final attacks. However, the two countries did later endorse the ceasefire. The direct confrontation between the long-times foes started when Israel launched surprise attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities that killed prominent politicians, military leaders and nuclear scientists. Iran responded with waves of missile and drone strikes against Israeli cities and military sites. While Trump made it clear he was initially directly, the US joined and bombed Iran’s main nuclear facilities with its uniquely powerful “bunker busting” bombs. Like with many of the other conflicts he claims to have ended, Trump’s role in bringing the violence to an end is unclear. No peace agreement or a firm deal on the future of Iran’s nuclear program has been reached and both Iran and Israel have threatened each other since then. India and Pakistan got embroiled in their in decades in May, after India fired missiles across nine sites in Pakistan in response to a massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan. The conflict was raging for several days when, out of the blue, Trump announced on social media that the US had to the fighting. There are conflicting accounts of how the ceasefire was negotiated. Islamabad praised US involvement and for the Nobel Peace Prize for what it said was “decisive diplomatic intervention.” India downplayed Trump’s involvement, saying instead the was agreed “directly between the two countries.” India has fiercely resisted any foreign intervention on the issue of Kashmir, the disputed region over which India and Pakistan fought several wars, insisting it’s not up to other countries to get involved. When the representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda signed a peace agreement brokered by the US in June, it was hailed by Trump as “a Great Day for Africa and, quite frankly, a Great Day for the World!” However, there is little to suggest that the conflict – one of the most protracted and complex conflicts in the world – is easing in any way. Scores of militia groups that have fought for three decades are still engaging in deadly fighting, the rebel-held city of Goma, home to more than 2 million people, earlier this month. Local people, aid workers and rebel leaders told CNN the fighting and the hardships caused by it continue. The same week, the United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) released a on the escalation of hostilities between January and July 2025 in North and South Kivu, the provinces in eastern DR Congo’s where two of its largest cities Goma and Bukavu are located. It is unclear how exactly Trump ended this conflict, since Egypt and Ethiopia were not, and are not, actually at war. However, the two are locked in a bitter dispute over a massive hydroelectric dam that Ethiopia officially opened earlier this month – and there are worried that this rift could escalate. Sitting on a tributary of the Nile, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, took some 15 years to built and the Ethiopians see it as a key to their future economic prosperity. Egypt and Sudan have long opposed the dam, arguing that it would negatively impact the availability of water downstream. Egypt has argued that under a colonial-era treaty signed with Britain, it has the rights to veto any projects on the Nile. Another puzzling item on Trump’s list of conflicts he has solved. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nine years after NATO launched a bombing campaign against Serbian forces responsible for a brutal crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Serbia and Kosovo signed an economic normalization agreement during Trump’s first term in 2020, but Serbia continues to view Kosovo as a breakaway state and does not recognize its independence. Tensions between the two continue to flare up every few months, with the European Union – which both countries wish to join – playing a key role in mediation.

{"content": "A prominent Jewish advocacy group filed a lawsuit on Thursday against Hamas and other armed groups, as well as Iran, Syria and North Korea, seeking billions in damages over the October 7 attacks in Israel. The suit, brought on behalf of more than 140 plaintiffs, including US victims and their family members, was filed by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and law firm Crowell & Moring in the US District Court in Washington, DC, just weeks before the two-year anniversary of the attack. The lawsuit seeks at least $7 billion in damages from the armed groups and from the three foreign countries, which it accuses of providing Hamas with “support and resources” for the terror attacks. The lawsuit appears to be largely symbolic in nature and it’s not clear how those bringing the case plan to serve papers on foreign states or Hamas, an Islamist movement that has been majorly diminished and had much of its leadership eliminated during the war in Gaza. Many of the plaintiffs and defendants are also parties in by the ADL in the same court last year against Iran, Syria and North Korea, which similarly accused the states of providing support to Hamas. The plaintiffs in that case were able to serve papers to Iran with diplomatic help from Switzerland, but they have not successfully served Syria or North Korea and none of the countries have responded in court. “The victims of the October 7 massacre deserve justice, accountability and redress,” said ADL CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt. “This lawsuit seeks to do that by holding those responsible for the carnage accountable, from the state sponsors who provided the funding, weapons, and training to the terrorist organizations who carried out these unspeakable atrocities.” Among the plaintiffs in the case are David and Hazel Brief, whose son Yona, died from injuries sustained during the attack. They said in a statement provided by the ADL that Yona’s life was “senselessly cut short.” “We believe it is critical that those responsible for the horrific terror inflicted that day are held accountable in a court of law, to ensure the record is clear as to who helped support, plan and carry out the violence that day,” they added. During the October 7, 2023 attack, Hamas and several other militant groups stormed the and nearby communities in southern Israel, killed more than 1,200 people and took 251 others hostage. Nearly two years later, have been returned alive to Israel, but the Israeli government says 47 are still held captive inside Gaza 25 of those remaining have been declared dead, while 20 are believed to be alive; the status of the others is uncertain. Over the course of the war, Israeli forces have killed nearly 65,000 Palestinians and injured more than 164,000, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. This week, Israel announced it had begun a ground incursion into Gaza City and an independent UN inquiry concluded for the first time that against Palestinians in Gaza, which its government has denied. Iran, Syria and North Korea have been designated by the US State Department as “state sponsors of terrorism.” The designation is applied by the secretary of state to countries found to have “repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.” Foreign states are typically allowed immunity from prosecution in the US under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. But the law makes exceptions for state sponsors of terrorism, as well as for “personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking” or “material support” of these activities by state officials. In their statement, David and Hazel Brief said they hoped that the litigation would “help prevent attacks like these in the future, so that no other families have to go through losing a loved one as a result of such violence.”", "tags": ["lawsuit", "october", "north", "victims", "hamas", "attacks", "file", "syria"]},
{"content": "The United States, South Korea and Japan this week are conducting “advanced” trilateral air and naval exercises in East Asia, less than two weeks after the leaders of Russia, China and North Korea issued an unprecedented challenge to the US-led world order. The Freedom Edge 2025 exercise, being conducted around South Korea’s southern Jeju Island, is aimed ﻿at “countering North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats and safeguarding peace and stability in the region,” South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a news release. The US military’s Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii said the exercise will be used to “refine ballistic missile defense” between the US and its two key Asian allies and represents “the most advanced demonstration of trilateral defense cooperation to date,” without giving details. The five-day Freedom Edge drills come as the same time as a major US-Japan bilateral exercise – – that has seen Washington deploy missile launchers with the range to hit mainland China to Japan. Though the exercises are planned well in advance, they come less than two weeks after the leaders of China, Russia and North Korea stood shoulder to shoulder in Beijing for that showcased China’s modern weaponry – including new ballistic missiles – and unprecedented solidarity between the three nuclear-armed authoritarian partners. Increased cooperation directly with Russia has seen North Korea send troops and weaponry to aid its’ war in Ukraine, and Pyongyang and Moscow sign a . Many observers expect North Korea may get the benefit of Russian missile technology to further its nuclear missile program. Meanwhile, in its readout of talks between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in Beijing, China made no mention of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, a long-held goal. Analysts say that indicates of North Korea as a nuclear power. Both Freedom Edge and Resolute Dragon have drawn criticism from adversaries. A statement from North Korea’s Central Military Commission called Freedom Edge “the most comprehensive and offensive war drill for aggression in terms of scale, content and nature” that has been conducted on the southern Korean Peninsula. “The US and its allies are gradually undermining the security environment of the Korean Peninsula,” the statement from Pak Jong Chon, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, said. For its part, China last month urged the US not to send the Typhon missile system to Japan for the Resolute Dragon exercises. Analysts noted important differences in the spectacle of the military parade in Beijing and the current exercises happening with the US and its allies. “Kim, Putin, and Xi sent a clear geopolitical signal by appearing shoulder to shoulder at a massive military parade in Tiananmen Square. That was symbolic of a shared willingness to advance power and interests against external pressure,” said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “In contrast, US-Japan-South Korea trilateral defense exercises are less political theater and more practical cooperation,” Easley said. And they’re enduring, said Hong Min, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul. “Security cooperation between South Korea and the US, and among South Korea, the US and Japan have been in place well before economic issues emerged between Seoul and Washington,” Hong said. He added that the three share a view that “consistent responses and messaging toward North Korea and stable and continued exercises are required.” In Korea’s case, those economic issue include the in Georgia that saw hundreds of South Koreans detained; and in Japan’s by a trade deal with Washington that some analysts say tilts in the US’s favor. Robert Ward, Japan chair at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Resolute Dragon exercises send “an important strategic message to China about the depth and breadth of US-Japan security cooperation.” This year’s version of the annual exercises is the largest since they began in 2021, Ward said. “Given the uncertainties over US trade policy, this is doubly important,” he added. While the exercises off Korea and in Japan may be drawing headlines at the moment, it’s notable that they are just two of in a long list of US exercises and deployments around the region. Last weekend, the US, Japanese and Philippine militaries concluded their second set of maneuvers in the South China Sea in a month, reaffirming  “defense cooperation as tensions rise over China’s moves to tighten its grip on contested waters,” a press release from the Armed Forces of the Philippines said. And last Friday, US and British warships steamed through the Taiwan Strait. The People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command accused the US and British warships of “trouble-making and provocation.” But the US military said they were exercising navigational rights and freedoms in what is an international waterway. Taken together, the range of exercises show the military solidarity Washington often calls “iron-clad” appears to remain just that. “This exercise series represents the latest indicator of the growing cooperation and interoperability among America’s allies in the Asia-Pacific region,” Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center, said. And, speaking specifically about the trilateral exercises off Korea, the US Indo-Pacific Command agrees. “The continued cooperation of all three nations tangibly demonstrates strength and an unwavering commitment to the defense of our vital interests against shared threats and strengthens deterrence in the Asia-Pacific through bolstering combat-credible forces,” it said.", "tags": ["washington", "alliances", "bring", "strong", "pacific", "threats"]},
{"content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said there is no reason to avoid dialog with the US if Washington stops insisting his country give up nuclear weapons but he will never trade away the nuclear arsenal to be free of sanctions, state media reported on Monday. In a speech at the Supreme People’s Assembly on Sunday, Kim said: “Personally, I still have fond memories of US President (Donald) Trump,” KCNA reported. The two leaders three times during Trump’s first presidency. The comments come at a time the new liberal government in Seoul is urging Trump to take the lead in reopening dialog with Kim, six years after all peace talks with Pyongyang collapsed over a clash on sanctions and nuclear dismantlement. “If the United States drops the absurd obsession with denuclearising us and accepts reality, and wants genuine peaceful coexistence, there is no reason for us not to sit down with the United States,” Kim was quoted as saying. It was a matter of survival for the country to build nuclear weapons to safeguard its security against grave threats from the United States and South Korea, Kim said, listing a series of regular military drills by the allies that he said have evolved into exercises for a nuclear war. Recent overtures from Washington and Seoul for dialog are disingenuous because their fundamental intent to weaken the North and destroy his regime remains unchanged, Kim said, adding a phased proposal by the South on ending the North’s nuclear programs was proof of that. “The world already knows full well what the United States does after it makes a country give up its nuclear weapons and disarms,” Kim said. “We will never give up our nuclear weapons.” “There will never be, and will never ever be for eternity, any negotiations with enemies of exchanging some things out of some obsession with lifting sanctions.” Sanctions have been “a learning experience” and made his country stronger and more resilient, he said. North Korea has been under a series of UN Security Council resolutions imposing economic sanctions and arms embargoes that have squeezed funding for military development but it has continued to make advances in building nuclear weapons and powerful ballistic missiles. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said in an interview with Reuters those sanctions have ultimately failed to deter the North, which today is adding massive nuclear weapons numbering 15 to 20 to its arsenal every year. “The reality is that the previous approach of sanctions and pressure has not solved the problem; it has worsened it,” Lee said. Lee has made peace overtures since taking office in June, saying dialog with Pyongyang was necessary, and has proposed steps to build confidence and eventually end the North’s nuclear program. Lee told Reuters there are formidable obstacles to reopening dialog with the North but he still believed the phased approach on dismantling Pyongyangs nuclear program was the realistic option. It was necessary to create the right conditions to bring the North back to the table and Trump has a key role to play in those efforts, Lee said.", "tags": ["drops", "memories", "un", "demand", "trump", "fond", "denuclearization", "talks", "jong", "open", "kim"]},
{"content": "The US Air Force is putting a permanent drone presence on the Korean Peninsula, reviving a World War II-era squadron to bolster security amid simmering military tensions in the region. The 431st Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron was activated on Monday at Kunsan Air Base on South Korea’s west coast, south of the capital Seoul. It will fly MQ-9 Reaper drones from the installation. It’s another move towards strengthening the US military’s air capabilities on the peninsula, after it repositioned F-16 fighter jets closer to North Korea in recent months. It also comes just weeks after North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un with China’s leader Xi Jinping at a massive in Beijing. The Reapers are unmanned single-engine turboprops that can perform a variety of combat and other missions, according to an Air Force fact sheet. With an extended range of more than 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers) and the ability to stay airborne indefinitely with aerial refueling, the Reapers will provide a substantial boost to US forces in the region. The range of the Reapers covers not only – the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea is about 150 miles north of Kunsan – but also the East China Sea and Taiwan, about 800 miles away. The Chinese mainland is only about 250 miles from Kunsan, and the Bohai Sea, where the Chinese navy often holds exercises, is about 600 miles from the US air base. “MQ-9 operations will support US-Korean priorities in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance across the Indo-Pacific theater,” an Air Force statement said. The military region stretches from the waters off the west coast of the US to the western border of India, and from Antarctica to the North Pole. “Deploying the MQ-9 brings a powerful capability to the region,” Lt. Col. Douglas Slater, who will command the squadron, said in a statement. “We’re here to support the mission, deepen cooperation and demonstrate our shared commitment to maintaining security and stability across the Indo-Pacific,” Slater said. For combat missions, the MQ-9s can carry a range of weapons, from Hellfire missiles to laser-guided bombs. Permanently stationing the Reapers at Kunsan shows Washington’s commitment to South Korea and its other Pacific allies and partners at a time when some have raised doubts about that as the Trump administration looks at security challenges closer to home. It was not announced how many Reapers would be based at Kunsan, but an Air Force fact sheet shows 50 in the inventory of US Special Operations Command as of January. Labeling the drone unit as the 431st squadron revives a name that traces back to World War II, when it was activated in 1943 as the 431st Fighter Squadron in Australia, flying long-range P-38 Lightning fighters as escorts for US bombers in the Pacific theater. The 431st was last active as a test squadron for F-111 aircraft in California, shutting down in 1992. Activating the squadron in South Korea is the Air Force’s second big move of the year on the peninsula. In July, the service started moving F-16 fighter jets from Kunsan just over 80 miles to the north to Osan Air Base, to form what it calls a “super squadron” closer to North Korea. A total of 31 F-16s and 1,000 personnel were to be moved from Kunsan to Osan by October, the Air Force said in a statement in July. The temporary transfer is expected to last through October of next year to see if it can “maximize capabilities and increase combat effectiveness on the Korean Peninsula,” an Air Force statement said.", "tags": ["china", "unit", "miles", "drone", "reaper"]},
{"content": "Japan’s governing party on Saturday elected former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, making her likely to become the country’s first female prime minister. In a country that ranks poorly internationally for gender equality, Takaichi would make history as the of Japan’s long-governing conservative Liberal Democratic Party. She is one of the most conservative members of the male-dominated party. Takaichi beat Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, in a runoff in an intraparty vote by the LDP on Saturday. Takaichi replaces Prime Minister as the party hopes to regain public support and stay in power after major election losses. She is likely to be Japan’s next prime minister because the party remains by far the largest in the lower house, which determines the national leader, and because opposition groups are highly splintered. The LDP, whose consecutive losses in parliamentary elections in the past year have left it in the minority in both houses, wants to select a leader who can quickly address challenges in and outside Japan, while seeking cooperation from key opposition groups to implement its policies. Five candidates — two currently serving and three former ministers — were vying for the LDP presidency. Saturday’s vote only involved 295 LDP parliamentarians and about 1 million dues-paying members. It only reflected 1 per cent of the Japanese public. A parliamentary vote is expected in mid-October. The LDP, which has been criticized by opposition leaders for creating a prolonged political vacuum, needs to hurry because the winner will soon face a diplomatic test: a possible summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who could demand that Japan increase its . A meeting is reportedly being planned for late October. Trump will travel to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea starting October 31. The LDP also needs help from the opposition, which it has long neglected. The party will likely look to expand its current coalition with the moderate centrist Komeito with at least one of the key opposition parties, which are more centrist. All five candidates have called themselves “moderate conservatives” to show their willingness to work with the opposition. They all campaigned for measures to combat rising prices and achieve larger salary increases, to strengthen defense and the economy, and for tougher measures on foreign workers. They stayed away from divisive liberal social issues such as gender equality and sexual diversity. Experts say they avoided discussing their usual political views on historical issues, same-sex marriage and other contentious topics, including the party’s political funds scandal, which was the biggest reason for their election losses, and anti-corruption measures. Their avoidance of these subjects raised doubts over the party’s ability to regain public trust, analysts said. Earlier polls had Koizumi, Takaichi and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, a moderate veteran politician as front-runners. Two others, Trade Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Economic Minister Takayuki Kobayashi, were seen as less likely contenders.

{"content": "ruling party is in trouble, and it knows it. The country is rife with political instability, having cycled through four prime ministers in the last five years – all members of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). And while the LDP has ruled Japan almost continuously for the last 30 years, it’s now in a precarious position as it prepares to on Saturday – mired in scandal, widely unpopular, and abandoned by longtime supporters who have instead flocked to new right-wing parties. The next party leader could very well become the country’s next prime minister, but even that’s not guaranteed; voters in the past two parliamentary elections, delivering seats to opposition parties and Key Japanese neighbors, especially China, will be watching closely to see who comes out on top. Japan’s political volatility began after Shinzo Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020. Abe – widely seen as Japan’s last stable leader, having ruled for nearly nine years – was Since his tenure ended, the LDP has faced fallout over a slush fund scandal, an inflation surge, and a rightward political shift across the country. This election, the LDP hopes, might change that. The front-runners all offer a different way forward. One is a veteran operator and government bureaucrat. Another, who could be Japan’s youngest postwar prime minister, bills himself as a moderate reformist. The third is a firebrand conservative who could become the country’s first female leader. “They are looking to try to change the face of the party, to get back voters that they’ve lost in the last two elections,” said Jeffrey Hall, a Japanese studies lecturer specializing in politics at Kanda University of International Studies in Chiba. “In the past, voters often overlooked scandals, but now I think they’re very fed up with it. And the alternatives offered by other conservative parties, center-right or far-right parties have been more attractive to voters,” he added. This frustration is clear among the public, with few expressing any optimism or excitement for the election when CNN spoke to them on the street earlier this week. Most declined to share their names, but one salaryman described the LDP as lacking transparency and accountability, while a 60-year-old professional in Tokyo’s Ginza district called all the candidates “weak-kneed.” One finance worker in Tokyo’s Roppongi district was scathing. “Even watching the current LDP leadership election, in the end, nothing fundamental ever changes, and they don’t say anything meaningful,” he said. “It makes you wonder, ‘Are there any decent people left?’ This guy, that guy… they’re all the same.” One of the biggest drivers of the LDP’s downfall was a funding scandal in late 2023 involving millions of dollars in , and lawmakers allegedly lining their own pockets with kickbacks, or failing to properly declare their income. Despite some efforts at damage control, the party “hasn’t really done anything significant to change its ways, it hasn’t significantly punished politicians who were involved in these scandals,” causing voters to lose trust in the LDP, said Hall. Public sentiment was as inflation and living costs skyrocketed. For instance, the cost of rice – Japan’s prime staple food – has almost doubled from last year, staying stubbornly high even after authorities and imported foreign rice. Voters also tend to lean more nationalist and conservative during economic downturns, said Hajime Kidera, a professor at Meiji University’s School of Political Science and Economics – which is one reason Abe was so popular during the post-recession early 2010s. “He effectively tapped into those frustrations; in other words, the feelings of people who took pride in being Japanese but were struggling in their daily lives,” Kidera said. “The same is said about Germany, the UK, and other advanced countries,” he added. And it could be why many in Japan are now gravitating toward more conservative, Abe-like candidates. Another issue grabbing national attention is of foreign residents and visitors, which has fueled that sometimes turns outright xenophobic. Many argue that Japan is at risk of losing its way of life, or that Japanese workers are being edged out of jobs. “It has become a very much important issue in the Japanese landscape,” said Hiroshi Shiratori, a professor of political science at Hosei University. “You had the populist new right movement in Europe and the United States; the same thing (is occurring) in Japan gradually.” Some young far-right parties have capitalized on this shift. For instance, the burgeoning won big in parliamentary elections in July, bagging 14 seats in the upper house after campaigning on the Trumpian message “Japanese First.” Sanseito began as an online group, whose YouTube channel now has more than half a million subscribers. Its success also reflects Japan’s shift to become a “digitalized society” in recent years, said Shiratori – with the LDP “lagging behind” and increasingly viewed as old-fashioned and disconnected from voters. The LDP is now under intense pressure to win back right-wing voters. In ongoing campaigns, most candidates promise to tighten immigration – while taking pains not to alienate moderate parts of the base. “The party is entering an identity crisis, in which it has failed to cater to both the general public and conservative voters,” said Rintaro Nishimura, a Tokyo-based senior associate at The Asia Group, a consulting firm. “Now, it looks as though the LDP is only focused on self-preservation and with no sense of direction,” Nishimura added. Though a number of candidates are in the running, attention has largely been focused on three front-runners – who could all take Japan in a different direction. The most popular among the public so far, according to several polls, is former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi. If she wins this weekend and is nominated for prime minister, she could be the country’s first-ever female leader in a country where men historically dominate politics as much as they do the boardroom. But she’s the most deeply conservative of the bunch – which could alarm some in the party, as well as some of Japan’s key neighbors, especially China and South Korea. She’s hawkish on security and diplomacy, conservative on social issues, and keen on boosting government spending to stimulate economic growth (in a continuation of former leader Abe’s policies). While Takaichi has compared herself to Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to become British prime minister, some skeptics view her as “more like a Liz Truss in that she could damage the economy,” said Hall. If she wins, it could signal “an attempt to return to the Abe era of conservativism” and to win back right-wing voters, said Nishimura. It could also complicate relations with South Korea, added Hall – like Abe, Takaichi regularly visits a controversial war shrine that includes the names of convicted war criminals, viewed by Asian neighbors as a symbol of Japan’s imperial militarism of the early 20th century. Within the LDP, there may be greater support for agriculture minister Shinjiro Koizumi – who, at 44, could become Japan’s youngest prime minister since the end of WWII. He’s the son of former Prime Minister Koizumi Junichirō, and the fourth generation of a political dynasty. He is seen as a younger, more moderate voice – having vowed to clean up politics, initiate discussions on constitutional reform and allow married couples to use separate surnames, something currently banned under law. (Takaichi has vehemently opposed changing the law.) Koizumi is also friendly with the center-right Japan Innovation Party, also known as Ishin, which holds a significant number of seats in parliament, said Hall – so if he wins, the LDP may gain a valuable partner in passing legislation and winning elections. “A Koizumi victory would suggest that the LDP believes he represents the ‘rebirth’ of the party and is most capable of winning younger generations of voters in the elections to come,” said Nishimura. Finally, there’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, whose current role is pivotal as top government spokesperson. He’s among the most experienced, having served in various ministerial roles including defense, foreign affairs and agriculture – gaining him a reputation as “the ‘handyman’ who is called upon in times of crisis,” said Nishimura. While he’s not as colorful a character as the other two candidates, he’s seen as a steady presence that could bring much-needed stability to the party. And he might have an advantage working with international partners, as a Harvard-educated fluent English speaker who once served as a staffer for a US representative and a US senator. But whoever wins, securing the party leadership is just the first step – and a host of problems await. Since the LDP has now lost majority control of parliament, there is no guarantee that its nominee will be selected as prime minister. It still has a good shot at it, since opposition parties are currently divided and unable to form a unified front, experts say – but it’s no longer a sure thing, as it was in years past. “There is great talk about enlarging the coalition government – they might put another opposition party into that LDP-Komeito coalition” to regain a parliamentary majority, said Shiratori. “So one of the issues is, who can make a good relationship with one of the opposition parties?” Whichever candidate is elected will also likely face opposition and infighting from within their own party, given the split between LDP conservatives and moderates, said Hall. Then comes the real work of actually governing the world’s fourth-largest economy, with the future prime minister inheriting a slate of thorny issues. Most pressing is inflation – but there’s also Japan’s , with a rapidly aging population, falling birthrate, shrinking workforce, and growing costs of elder care and welfare. There’s also the matter of with the US administration of President Donald Trump and reasserting Japan’s presence on the world stage, diminished in the last few years thanks to the revolving door of leaders. With so much at stake, “it doesn’t seem likely that whoever becomes prime minister can suddenly refresh the LDP and make it an inspiring party that the voters will back,” said Hall. “It’s really hard to see Japan having stable leadership.” CNN’s Yumi Asada and Riku Inoue contributed to this report.", "tags": ["rivals", "crisis", "leader", "party", "voters", "japan"]},
{"content": "A Japanese warship is on the way to the United States to be fitted with Tomahawk cruise missiles, the latest move by Washington and its Asian allies to beef up firepower as adversaries like China and North Korea expand theirs. The JS Chokai, an Aegis-equipped guided-missile destroyer, is steaming to the US for a year-long deployment during which the ship will undergo modifications – and crew training – to enable it to launch the Tomahawks, maneuverable cruise missiles with a range of about 1,000 miles. That would put targets deep inside China or North Korea well within range of the Japanese warship. Japan in early 2024 signed a deal with the US to acquire 400 Tomahawks as part of Tokyo’s plans to increase defense spending to counter regional threats in what Defense Minister Gen Nakatani has called the since World War II. China’s military activities present “the greatest strategic challenge” to Japan, the Defense Ministry’s annual white paper, released in July, said. Beijing is “rapidly enhancing its military capability” while “intensifying” activities around the region, Nakatani said in introducing that white paper, specifically mentioning the Senkaku Islands, a chain in the East China Sea that Tokyo controls but which is also claimed by Beijing, which calls them the Diaoyus. China showed off some of that new capability – including powerful anti-ship missiles, during in Beijing on September 3. On the viewing stand with Chinese leader Xi Jinping that day was Kim Jong Un, who days later was , and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, who recently signed a defense treaty with Kim. In announcing the dispatch of the destroyer to the US, the Defense Ministry said Japan’s Self-Defense Forces are “strengthening their stand-off defense capabilities in order to intercept and eliminate invading forces against Japan at a rapid pace and at long range.” Though Tokyo cites the Tomahawk’s “defense capabilities,” the missiles are regarded as offensive weapons. In fact, a US Navy fact sheet on the missiles says they are “used for deep land-attack warfare” and the full name of the weapon is the “Tomahawk Land Attack Missile,” or TLAM. When Japan asked to buy the Tomahawks in 2023, China bristled at the move, calling out Tokyo for breaching its post-World War II “pacifist constitution,” which restricted the Japanese military – the Japan Self-Defense Forces – to a strictly defensive role. “The moves by the US and Japan exacerbate the momentum of an arms race, affect peace and stability in the region, seriously disrupt global strategic balance and stability and undermine the international order,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at the time. Tomahawks are one of the most proven weapons in the US arsenal. According to manufacturer Raytheon, the cruise missiles “can strike targets precisely from 1,000 miles away, even in heavily defended airspace.” Besides naval surface ships, the Tomahawks can also be fired from submarines and land platforms. They’ve been used in combat well over 2,000 times, according to Raytheon, including in June when submarine-launched Tomahawks were used in the In a statement, the Japanese Defense Ministry said it planned to have the Chokai ready for “actual missions” by next summer through a process that would include live-fire testing. First steps in that process occurred last week, when the Chokai practiced loading dummy Tomahawk munitions into its vertical launch cells. The 528-foot-long, 9,500-ton Chokai has 90 of the vertical launch cells, which it can also use to launch surface-to-air missiles, anti-ballistic missiles, air defense missiles and anti-submarine rockets. It’s similar in size and armament to the US Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. Beside the US Navy, Britain’s Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy have demonstrated Tomahawk launch capability. Australia joined that group last December, with the successful firing of a Tomahawk by the destroyer HMAS Brisbane off the US West Coast. Canberra plans to buy 200 Tomahawks, which the Australian Defense Ministry said will allow its naval vessels to “perform long-range precision strike against land targets.”", "tags": ["arms", "warship", "targets", "missiles", "miles", "heats", "race", "japan"]},
{"content": "As world leaders gather in New York this week for the UN General Assembly (UNGA), their focus will be on immediate crises, including Gaza and Ukraine, with both conflicts now poised to last through the rest of this year and into 2026. I have participated in numerous UNGA meetings with presidents of both political parties. The issues tend to be dominated by the current headlines, but looking back, the story of those gatherings is often what wasn’t covered, rather than what was. At UNGA in 2013, for example, nobody anticipated the following year would be dominated by the global scourge of ISIS. Ten years later, at UNGA in 2023, nobody anticipated that within weeks, Hamas would invade Israel and ignite the Middle East. Similarly, in 2019, nobody anticipated a global pandemic that would soon change our way of life. This year seems no different, because if we peer ahead, today’s relentless pace of events in global affairs may be an appetizer for what’s coming. Let’s first consider the immediate crises, which will take up much of the focus this week. In Gaza, this year began with the promise of a three-phased ceasefire deal to secure the release of all hostages and to ultimately end the war. That deal broke down in March, after its first phase, and since then, we’ve seen talks deadlock together with a humanitarian crisis, the largest Israeli military operations of the war, and hostages still being held. Today, there is no immediate end in sight, or agreement on what to do next. In New York, several countries led by France and the UK will a Palestinian state with borders and attributes of sovereignty to be determined at some distant point in the future. These countries will also call for Hamas to give up and disarm – something that end the war for good – but they have no ability to deliver that outcome. Unfortunately, these symbolic moves may worsen the situation. They will trigger counter moves by Israel in the West Bank and harden Hamas’s demands in line with their twisted world view that was worth the costs to Palestinian lives in Gaza – making a potential resolution to this terrible war even harder to achieve diplomatically. In Ukraine, this year has seen zigzags from Washington with calls for a unilateral ceasefire replaced by calls for a comprehensive deal, military support for Ukraine stopped and then restarted, and sanctions against Russia threatened but never implemented. President Donald Trump’s high-level summits of August, with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska and European allies in Washington, served to highlight Putin’s maximalist aims as he seeks to acquire land he’s been unable to seize on the battlefield and ensure that Ukraine cannot defend itself from future Russian invasions. Ukraine will never accept such terms, leaving diplomacy adrift. Nothing said or done in New York this week will shift Putin’s calculus as Ukraine now looks ahead to a and some of the largest Russian attacks of the entire war. In the end, there is likely to be a lot of talk about Gaza and Ukraine in New York this week but expect no initiatives that might help wind-down or resolve either of these conflicts. Now compare this week’s performative gathering of leaders in New York to a summit held three weeks ago in Beijing – ostensibly to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The imagery was striking with Russia’s President Putin, China’s President Xi Jinping, and North Korea’s leader Kim-Jong Un, locked in embrace towards shared global aims, together with Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian. This alliance of countries, China-Russia-Iran-North Korea (CRINK), is not just symbolic. It’s actively shaping global realities in opposition to the United States, with Ukraine the current front line. North Korea has sent tens of thousands of soldiers to fight along-side Russian troops against Ukraine. Iran has provided drones and transferred technology for Russia to now mass produce Iranian drones inside Russia, leading to the swarm attacks launched into Ukraine over the last six months. China remains the largest purchaser of Russian energy products, helping to bankroll the war and sustain Russia’s economy. Now consider that Xi has ordered China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to be for a possible invasion of Taiwan by 2027, an event that would be truly cataclysmic, with estimates of global economic shock of around $10 trillion and disruption of the supply of advanced semiconductors that sustain our daily livelihoods. Might we look back in a few years and wonder how nobody at the UNGA in 2025 was discussing this possibility? As of today, most experts do not assess that Xi would order an invasion so soon, and he may never do so, preferring instead non-military gray zone operations, such as cyber-attacks, propaganda, military exercises, economic pressure and diplomatic isolation. The aim is to steadily erode Taipei’s confidence until it’s pressured into accepting full unification with the mainland without the need for a full-scale war. But the odds of an invasion are as high as 35 percent, to the risk assessment firm Global Guardian, and rise further as Beijing builds its military readiness. With each passing month, Xi, like Putin towards Ukraine, will calculate opportunities and costs in pursuit of clearly stated aims towards Taiwan. This is what links the Ukraine crisis to far broader global risks: If the CRINK alliance is strengthening month-by-month and Putin faces decreasing costs for his war of aggression in Ukraine, the risks of Xi’s more aggressive approach towards Taiwan will increase, as will aggression from other members of CRINK, including Iran’s hegemonic ambitions in the Middle East and North Korea’s erratic behaviors on the Korean peninsula. President Trump, when asked a question about the images from the Beijing summit, said, “They were hoping I was watching.” He later wrote on Truth Social, in a message directed to Xi, “give my warmest regards to Vladamir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America.” The president was right as to the intent and purpose of this gathering. These leaders sent a message to Washington. The question now is what message Washington sends back. Framed this way, the second year of Trump’s second term is shaping to be a historic gateway towards a world of consolidation and stability, or a world of increasing disorder and conflict. If the risks and costs of aggression across borders decrease for Putin and the other CRINK leaders, then we can expect the latter. If the costs rise, and the network of alliances historically held together by the US strengthen – from NATO, to Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines – expect the former. Add to the mix the ongoing race between the US and China in artificial intelligence, the closest we have come to an existential technological competition since the Cold War, and the table is set for 2026 to be perhaps one of the most pivotal years in a generation. President Trump often speaks of the conflict in Ukraine as a burden he inherited, and a problem related solely to the fighting in eastern Ukraine. Some of his top advisers have dismissed Ukraine’s relevance to American interests, or a distraction from the need to deter a future conflict over Taiwan. This two-dimensional view misses the global implications of the Ukraine conflict as exemplified in the recent Beijing summit. The CRINK capitals clearly see Ukraine as a war central to their future interests, and they are acting on that point of view. Similarly, American allies in the Pacific – particularly Japan and South Korea – have been vocal advocates for Ukraine, recognizing that a Russian failure there would help restrain and deter Xi’s ambitions in their region. Therefore, a strategist looking at the coming year should think three-dimensionally, and work to consolidate support for Ukraine with increasing economic costs for Russia, while also aggressively pursuing a negotiated settlement that winds down the war. Similarly, in the Middle East, ending the war in Gaza and returning to an agenda of regional integration, remains central to peace in that region and globally, with Iran further constrained. If both conflicts continue to fester, with no ends in sight, the seams of global order will tear further, with CRINK increasingly asserting advantage in multiple regions of the world. That’s the scenario few will be discussing in New York this week, yet it may be the most central question for the future of global security and America’s position in the world.", "tags": ["years", "generation", "pivotal"]},
{"content": "One by one, they emerge from their slumber: Dholu, an energetic young male with a noticeable limp; Oldie, the greying elder who loves a belly rub; and Snoopy, a golden-eyed boy who patiently waits his turn. They’re not summoned by a whistle but the familiar smell of khichdi, a traditional dish of rice and lentils. Himanshi Varma carries two large bags through this New Delhi neighborhood, where in the chaos of the capital, her evening ritual begins. For seven years, Varma has fed the city’s roaming strays – a silent pact she’s made with these homeless dogs after adopting a puppy born under the staircase of her home. Using her own savings, she has paid for the sterilization of more than 500 animals and found homes for hundreds more. “There’s no count and there’s no end,” she said as the pack of “Indies,” as Indian strays are affectionately known, play in the nearby grass. For a period, a quiet desperation cast a shadow on Varma’s daily act of compassion. A Supreme Court order on August 12 declared that their home – the streets of New Delhi – was no longer theirs to roam. The court, taking up the matter on its own following alarming reports of dog attacks, including where children had been , had ordered that all stray dogs in the capital territory be rounded up and permanently locked in shelters within eight weeks. The announcement caused panic among animal lovers and welfare organizations, who argued the city had nowhere near the infrastructure to house its vast stray population, estimated to be about 1 million. But on Friday, a wave of relief swept through their ranks. After a review by a special three-judge bench, the court issued a stay, modifying its previous directive. In its new ruling, it clarified that stray dogs picked up by authorities are to be sterilized and immunized, and then released back to the same area. Only animals found to be rabid or overly aggressive are to be kept from the streets. The ruling applies to all of India, the court said, while also banning the public distribution of food to dogs and calling for the creation of designated areas for feeding. “I think it’s a very thoughtful verdict,” said veterinarian Dr. Sarungbam Yaiphabi Devi. “It looks like the court definitely kept the public pulse in mind because so many people came out across India for their neighborhood dogs” The original intervention from India’s highest court was both swift and decisive – and controversial in a country with an ingrained cultural respect for animals. It is illegal to euthanize healthy strays in India, and a 2001 law states strays should be picked up, neutered, and vaccinated against rabies, before being released. While humane in principle, this approach has been challenging to implement effectively on a national scale. The sheer number of dogs overwhelms the limited funding and veterinary infrastructure in the world’s most populous country, meaning sterilization rates cannot keep pace with the dogs’ rapid breeding cycle. As a result, an estimated 62 million stray dogs – a figure reported by the Press Trust of India – roam the nation’s streets, neighborhoods, slums and villages. Many of these animals live in harmony with humans. But bites and fatal attacks have made people wary – along with the risk of infection. Rabies, a vaccine-preventable disease which can spread to humans if they are bitten or scratched by an infected animal, is almost always fatal unless a series of jabs can be administered soon after someone is bitten. Dogs are the source of most human rabies deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and contribute up to 99% of all rabies transmissions to humans. India is endemic for rabies, the WHO said, accounting for 36% of the world’s rabies deaths. “When I’m walking home late at night, there’s always a horde of dogs that I have to walk past,” said Delhi-based medical student Shriya Ramani. “If I have food left in my tiffin (food container), they smell it and then they jump on you, and that’s extremely scary.” She believes Delhi’s dog population must be controlled, but that it “should be done in a humane way.” Arjun Sen, the father of a 12-year-old boy who was bitten, feels stray dogs should be removed the streets “as soon as possible.” “This time, my son was bitten. Tomorrow, it can be someone else’s child,” he told Reuters. “This is a big problem.” Fears about dog attacks surged after the 2023 fatal mauling of a four-year-old boy in Hyderabad, an attack captured on CCTV that horrified the nation and sent shockwaves through media and political circles, sparking a frantic search for solutions. Some have attempted to challenge existing laws to better manage numbers. In 2016, a campaign to cull stray dogs in the southern state of Kerala gained traction after a series of bites, but it was met with furious opposition from animal rights activists. The controversial plan never materialized, illustrating the deadlock between public safety concerns and animal welfare advocacy. Devi, the veterinarian who cares for the city’s strays, struggled to see how the Supreme Court’s initial order could have been enacted. “The order was very unexpected,” she said. “Also unwarranted and impractical.” Devi runs a small animal sterilization unit in Delhi that can house up to 100 strays on a temporary basis. Already lacking funding, it is congested and in need of repair. She was worried that other centers like hers couldn’t have handled the hundreds of thousands of dogs the court had ordered to be picked up. Even larger shelters are at capacity. Just outside Delhi, in the satellite city of Gurugram, the Janm Foundation’s animal shelter illustrates the crisis on the front lines. Meenakshi Bareja cares for 78 dogs here, and the shelter is chronically understaffed and underfunded. The financial strain creates a near-constant state of panic. “We need 500,000 rupees ($5,700) a month, and we always have a shortage,” Bareja said. The stakes are visible in every kennel. All the dogs are rescued from the street, but many cannot be simply neutered and released. They need long-term care for injuries like a large tumor on a hind leg, partial paralysis from a suspected hit-and-run, or a deep, painful gash on a paw. A lifelong fear of dogs made Bareja an unlikely candidate for a job at an animal shelter, but the pandemic left her with few choices. What began as a reluctant paycheck slowly transformed into a profound sense of purpose. Her passion was so infectious that her husband, Naresh, joined her. When he whistles, the dogs they care for come bounding forward, their tails wagging in a frenzy of affection. “Gurugram has developed a lot,” he said of the city of more than 800,000. “But the dogs can’t leave their old living spots.” More than 100 people braved heavy rain in Mumbai to protest the Supreme Court’s original order last week. On Friday, after weeks of stress, Varma, the community feeder, said she was “on top of the world.” Though she has questions about the revised ruling, including what will qualify as an aggressive dog, the decision is a reprieve for the street dogs she lovingly calls her “kids.” “All that matters is that our kids’ stomachs are filled up,” she said. “They should be treated, vaccinated, and sterilized.”", "tags": ["court", "legal", "regain", "battle", "capital", "nation", "dogs", "stray", "right", "top"]},

Beer and beverage giant Asahi – which makes Asahi Super Dry Beer, Nikka Whisky and owns foreign brands like Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch – said the attack last week halted order placement and shipping operations and forced it to shut down production at most of its 30 factories nationwide. That led to shortages of the popular beer and other Asahi products at convenience stores in Japan. On Tuesday, Qilin, a ransomware group with a track record of infiltrating organizations around the world, claimed responsibility, saying it had stolen around 27 gigabytes of data. All six of Asahi’s alcohol factories nationwide and some of its soft drinks and food plants have now resumed operations, but it remains unclear when their production and shipment will be back to full service. Cybersecurity experts said the impact of the hack underscored the vulnerabilities and lack of preparedness among Japanese corporations, particularly when it comes to ransomware attacks in which hackers lock victims out of their systems and demand payments for restoration. It’s not known if a ransom was demanded from Asahi. While Japan boasts world-class robotics and other high-tech industries, it is also beset by a lack of skilled tech workers and low digital literacy rates among sections of its rapidly ageing population. Experts have also highlighted an “acute” shortage of cybersecurity professionals in Japan, with finding the supply-demand gap of those talents rapidly widening. In the first six months of this year, Japan’s National Police Agency 116 ransomware attacks on companies and individuals. Its survey also suggested the recovery costs for such attacks have increased compared to 2024, with the percentage of organizations that incurred more than $66,000 in costs increasing from 50% to 59%. But the real number of ransomware attacks is likely “ten times” higher, given that many organizations may be less inclined to report the incidents, Cartan McLaughlin, CEO of Tokyo-based cybersecurity firm Nihon Cyber Defence, told CNN. The attack against Asahi is the fourth cyber operations launched by Qilin against Japanese companies since June this year, according to Comparitech, a tech research site. The cybercrime group emerged in 2022 and has claimed more than 100 of confirmed ransomware attacks this year, the site said. Information Qiling claimed to have stolen from Asahi included budget, contracts, and personal data, shown in some 29 images posted on its website, according to a screenshot of the site supplied by a cybersecurity firm, which requested not to be named because of sensitivity. Part of the information has been made publicly available, Qilin said. On Wednesday, Asahi said that its investigations confirmed that data suspected of being transferred without authorization earlier has been found on the internet, though it did not name Qilin. It added that the scope of the leak remains under further probe. On Wednesday, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the government will work to strengthen cybersecurity measures across Japan in response to Asahi’s attack, warning that “system failures caused by cyberattacks could jeopardize national and public safety.” For years, Japanese enterprises have been relatively insulated from cyberattacks, in partly due to the language barrier, experts said. But advances in technology have significantly lowered the threshold for launching cyber operations against Japanese companies. That lack of attacks in previous years, however, has had a negative outcome — many companies now lack practical experience in responding to cyber incidents, according to McLaughlin of Nihon Cyber Defence. “Japan was slower to the game than the rest of the world,” he said. “You can buy all the cyber technology in the world. But if it’s not implemented and managed properly, then there’s no point in buying it.” McLaughlin said the ransomware attack on Asahi and its consequences serve as another “wake-up call” for Japan as the impact of cyber breaches is becoming ever larger. In late August, hackers hit luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover’s operations, forcing its factories in the United Kingdom to shut down for weeks. That hack has caused over 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) in losses, analysts estimated, with the carmaker’s plants yet to return to full capacity. In response to growing concerns about cybercrime, Japan passed a sweeping new cybersecurity law in May, granting the government more power to defend the country and its businesses against cyber threats. In July, the National Cybersecurity Office was also established to oversee the country’s cyber defense strategy. The fact that even well-established Japanese companies like Asahi can still be affected by cyberattacks highlights that such incidents have become “inevitable” in today’s environment, Masaki Hiraoka, managing director for North East Asia at Blackpanda, a cyber emergency response firm, told CNN. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence “enables threat actors to localize and automate their attacks more effectively,” making it easier than ever to target large enterprise and cyber infrastructure, he said. Given that no company can be completely immune to cyber threats, Hiraoka said the priority should be “not only on preventing breaches, but also on responding and recovering effectively when they occur.” To minimize disruptions, he added, companies need to establish clear response strategies in advance, such as partnerships with cyber incident response providers. Even as Asahi resumed shipments last week, demand for its popular alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks outpaced its delivery capacity. Spokespeople from Japan’s three largest convenience store chains all told CNN that they were experiencing some shortages of Asahi products, or worried about their stocks. “Asahi Super Dry is a top-selling beer in Japan, so it would be sad if it disappeared from stores. I just hope people don’t start hoarding it,” Tokyo housewife Shoko Watanabe, 58, said. “I never imagined a major Japanese corporation could be so easily and severely impacted by this kind of cyberattack.” CNN’s Yumi Asada and Yosuke Tomita contributed to this report.", "tags": ["renews", "brewer", "readiness", "hack", "cyberattack", "biggest", "concerns", "japan"]},
{"content": "A relationship frozen after a deadly clash high in the Himalayas five years ago appears to be thawing under the heat of US President Donald Trump’s economic pressure. For the first time since 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to China this week to attend a summit hosted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a visit that comes after Trump imposed punishing from India. In a moment of geopolitical whiplash, the two leaders – whose soldiers fought a brutal hand-to-hand combat with fists, rocks and clubs at their in 2020 – could now shake hands, prioritizing economic stability over entrenched rivalry. Alongside Modi, world leaders from Russia, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia will join Xi this weekend for what Beijing has said will be the largest summit yet of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a Moscow and Beijing-founded regional security club aimed at reshaping the global balance of power. India’s presence at the event is the most telling example yet of the warming ties between the two Asian powers – a budding realignment that threatens to undo years-long US efforts to cultivate New Delhi as a counterweight against a rising and increasingly assertive China. While a thaw in India and China’s fractious relationship was already underway, analysts say Trump’s “America First” policies are making the two leaders, who have built their political brands on a strong foundation of nationalism, explore a partnership of necessity. Trump’s imposition of tariffs over India’s purchases of Russian oil have been especially hard to swallow for Modi, who enjoyed with Trump during the US president’s first term. The threat of the levies “infused a certain amount of urgency” in New Delhi’s pivot toward stabilizing its relationship with Beijing, said Manoj Kewalramani, who heads Indo-Pacific studies at the Takshashila Institution research center in the Indian city of Bengaluru. However he said it wasn’t the “primary driver” for a reset, with both India and China looking to stabilize their relationship for their own national interests. Successive White House administrations have worked to boost strategic ties with India through technology transfers and joint military drills, working with the world’s largest democracy to counter an increasingly assertive China in the Indo-Pacific region. Losing India would be “the worst outcome” Following a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Prime Minister Modi in New Delhi last week, both sides recognized the recent improvements in their strained relationship. “India-China relations have made steady progress guided by respect for each other’s interests and sensitivities,” the Indian leader said. “Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity.” The view from Beijing, according to Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, is that “this detente was definitely started by Trump.” “India is no longer able to pretend that it still has strong support from (Washington),” Sun said. Therefore, Beijing’s view is that because the US has “dialed back” India has to “recalibrate its foreign policy and improve its relationship with China.” But analysts say the summit is unlikely to usher in a fundamental realignment. “To me, it’s not a reset in the sense that India is saying ‘we are done with America.’ That’s not going to happen,” said Kewalramani. “The United States remains (India’s) most important partner in the world, but China is our largest neighbor,” Kewalramani said. “We have to live with it.” The trajectory of India-China relations has evolved from one of post-colonial brotherhood to modern-day strategic rivalry. India was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China in 1950, with that decade characterized by a shared vision of Asian solidarity. That nascent friendship was, however, shattered by the 1962 Sino-Indian War, a brief but brutal conflict that established a legacy of deep mistrust and an unresolved border dispute that remains the relationship’s festering wound. In the decades that followed, the countries’ leaders took steps to build economic ties that saw bilateral trade grow, despite ongoing tensions at their shared border. But the deadly 2020 Galwan Valley clashes – which left at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead – violently upended this balance. “The 2020 clashes are not simply something India can put behind it,” said Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “Instead, the aim here is to ensure no such episodes repeat, and that is where rebuilding the relationship rests on reaching a joint understanding on border stability.” There has been a gradual normalization of ties between India and China after Modi and Xi met on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia last October. The two sides agreed to restart direct flights cancelled since the Covid-19 pandemic, Beijing recently agreed to reopen two pilgrimage sites in western Tibet to Indians for the first time in five years, and both started re-issuing tourist visas for each other’s citizens. India’s recalibration of ties with China is a textbook application of its policy of strategic autonomy, which prioritizes national interests over rigid bloc allegiance. At the SCO summit, as well as China’s Xi, Modi will be in the presence of the prime minister of traditional adversary Pakistan, with whom India recently engaged in a deadly conflict, as well as traditional partner Russia, whose continued oil sales to India since its invasion of Ukraine have irked the US and pushed Trump to slap 25% tariffs on Indian goods as punishment. This engagement with a China-dominated bloc stands in stark contrast to India’s deepening ties with the Quad – a security grouping with the US, Japan, and Australia – that is widely seen as a democratic counterweight to China’s growing influence in the Indian Ocean. With their border dispute locked in a stalemate, India is choosing to insulate its diplomatic and economic imperatives from the security conflict with China, according to Kewalramani from the Takshashila Institution. “While both sides know there are structural challenges and this relationship will remain difficult, both sides realize that a deterioration to the extent that it happened is in neither’s interest,” he said. India’s strategic recalibration toward China is rooted less in a softening security posture and more in economic necessity. Last year, China was India’s second-largest trading partner after the US, with bilateral trade reaching $118 billion, according to data from India’s department of commerce. India depends on China not just for finished goods like electronics, but for the essential intermediate products and raw materials that fuel its own industries. Yet, this economic entanglement exists under the shadow of a tense military reality. Any talks between Modi and Xi would be complicated by the tens of thousands of troops still deployed at their disputed Himalayan border and this unresolved conflict remains the primary barrier to rebuilding confidence. Last week, the two sides agreed to 10 points of consensus on their border issue, including maintaining “peace and tranquility,” according to a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow in the Center for Asia Policy Studies in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, notes, it’s “not clear that either side will really trust each other.” The major test, she said, is whether the rhetoric from the two leaders translates to de-escalation on the ground, something that has failed before. The future of the India-China relationship will be defined by their ability to manage this delicate dance. The future, said Asia Society’s Aamer, will bring “perhaps a more stable relationship, where competition isn’t necessarily over, but conflict is at bay.” CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed reporting", "tags": ["rare", "trip", "china", "trump", "modi", "tariff", "india"]},
{"content": "President Donald Trump said Friday he would impose a 100% tariff on China “over and above any Tariff they are currently paying” effective November 1 – massively escalating his trade war amid a heated dispute over export controls on rare earths. In a Truth Social post, Trump wrote that China had “taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them.” “This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago,” he wrote. “It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.” Trump said he would impose the new tariff November 1 “or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China.” Earlier in the day, Trump had blasted Chinese leader Xi Jinping on social media over China’s ramped-up efforts to impose export controls on critical rare earths, threatening economic retaliation and saying he no longer sees any reason to meet with Xi during a scheduled visit to the region later this month. At the time, Trump also threatened economic penalties against China, warning, “Dependent on what China says about the hostile ‘order’ that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move.” “For every Element that they have been able to monopolize, we have two,” he added. Beijing on Thursday, expanding the list of minerals under control and extending controls targeting their production technologies and their overseas use, including for military and semiconductor applications. The actions targeted an acute vulnerability for the US – one that has driven a significant Trump administration effort in recent months to identify, and rapidly scale up, mining and production capacity. And it immediately set off alarm bells inside the Trump administration, according to several administration officials. The move came as Beijing has sought to boost its leverage in trade talks with the United States and ahead of an expected meeting between Xi and Trump on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea later this month. Some administration officials saw it as a clear effort by Xi to secure leverage ahead of his planned face-to-face meeting with Trump, while others pointed to US export control actions that may have triggered a Chinese response. Trump initially suggested on Truth social the meeting was now in jeopardy. “I have not spoken to President Xi because there was no reason to do so,” he wrote. “This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World. I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so.” But asked later if it was indeed canceled, Trump responded: “I haven’t canceled, but I don’t know that we’re going to have it. But I’m going to be there regardless, so I would assume we might have it.” White House officials viewed China’s move this week as a dramatic escalation that could threaten the meeting even before Trump took to social media to publicly make the threat, according to a senior administration official and a source familiar with the matter. But there are also private frustrations at the White House after the US Commerce Department expanded the number of Chinese firms on an export controls backlist late last month that could have frustrated China, sources said. China had invited Trump to visit Beijing while he was on his trip to Asia later this month but without any clear deliverables the Trump administration turned down the invitation, according to the senior administration official. They had agreed to work toward a meeting on the sidelines of the economic summit. Trump on Friday also slammed China for choosing to announce the steps Thursday, suggesting doing so minimized his attempts to secure a . “The Chinese letters were especially inappropriate in that this was the Day that, after three thousand years of bedlam and fighting, there is PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST,” he wrote. “I wonder if that timing was coincidental?” Trump’s comments underscore the clear anxiety tied to Xi’s hold over a market critical to the national security of the US and its Western allies. Top Trump officials have convened technology and rare earth company executives in their push to accelerate development up and down the supply chain necessary for domestic production, officials said. The message delivered – in meetings and rounds of phone calls throughout the summer – was centered on the urgent need to mollify the risks exposed by China’s actions in the spring. The administration’s efforts included the announcement of a $400 million equity stake in MP Materials Corp, the only US rare earth producer, and a government-backed price floor to bolster its operations. But US officials have acknowledged that the overall effort will still take time and, as a result, leave the country and its allies vulnerable to Xi’s strategic whims in the near term. That reality has served as the basis for multiple rounds of US-China trade talks in recent months, and has been a central focus of Trump’s approach to Xi in the lead up to their planned meeting. China’s dominance has long been a concern after the nation’s hammer-lock on the market was laid bare during a 2010 maritime dispute with Japan. But Trump’s decision to threaten escalating trade war with the country, at the same time the US has actively sought to limit western technology critical to China’s national and economic security, sparked Xi’s most aggressive moves to leverage that market dominance to date. “It was a real eye-opening moment for the entire world,” a senior US official told CNN of China’s actions in the spring. “A seismic-level geopolitical moment where everyone realized the scale of the vulnerability.” Wall Street investors were taking Trump seriously in the wake of his initial threat of economic retaliation on Friday. Stocks . The Dow fell 879 points, or 1.9%. The broader S&P 500 dropped 2.71% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.56%. Tariff anxiety was at its highest in the spring when tit-for-tat tariffs pushed taxes on Chinese imports up to a minimum of 145%. Stocks nearly entered a bear market in April, and fears only started to ease up later that month when the Trump administration exempted smartphones and electronics from Chinese tariffs – a significant concession that represented the first sign of a potential breakthrough in what was an effective embargo on all Chinese goods in the US. In May, both China and the United States significantly reduced tariffs, and the markets have since risen to new record highs. Although Trump eventually raised tariffs on dozens of countries’ exports to the United States, tariffs on China had remained relatively low, keeping economic angst to a relative minimum. That’s why stocks are sinking Friday: The market had largely been ignoring Trump’s tariffs, because China’s trade dispute had effectively been a sleeping giant. Negotiations were slow-going but had managed to keep higher tariffs at bay. Now that the giant may have been woken up, investors are getting “Liberation Day” fears all over again. And for a reason: Trade with China is crucial for the US economy, particularly ahead of the holiday season (that’s why Amazon and Target’s stocks are sinking) and as AI heats up (tech stocks are among the hardest hit Friday). Tensions have been bubbling for many months: Both China and the US have recently tightened export controls on key exports, including rare-earths and AI chips. They’ve launched investigations into each country’s major companies and imposed high port fees in recent months. The US threatened to block student visas and also imposed export controls for software tools, aerospace equipment and the sale of ethane, a major petroleum byproduct for China. A US official said those options – and more – are now back on the table in line with Trump’s social media warning posted Friday morning.

{"content": "Dabur, Indian rival of Colgate-Palmolive, is making its toothpaste a test of nationalism by asking consumers to shun American brands, as companies intensify promotion of local goods amid worsening trade ties with the United States. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday reiterated his call to use “Swadeshi,” or made-in-India goods. Children should “make a list” of foreign-branded goods, Modi said, while teachers should push them to not use them. US President Donald Trump last week imposed on imported Indian goods, prompting Modi’s supporters to start a WhatsApp campaign to boycott American brands including McDonald’s, Pepsi and Apple. Consumer goods company Dabur, valued at $11 billion, took out a front-page newspaper advertisement this week carrying photos of unbranded toothpaste packs that resemble Colgate packaging. Without naming its rival, the ad said India’s favorite toothpaste brand was American, and Dabur was the “Swadeshi” choice. “Born there, not here”, it said, referring to the unnamed toothpaste, in a font styled with the red, white and blue of the American flag. Dabur declined to comment on the advertisement, and Colgate did not respond to queries from Reuters. Colgate has a 43% share of India’s toothpaste market, followed by the Indian unit of Unilever, home to the Pepsodent brand in the country. Dabur is in third place with a 17% share, according to Euromonitor data for 2024. India’s population of 1.4 billion is for American consumer goods, often purchased from US online retailer Amazon, and over the years the reach of US brands has expanded deep into smaller towns. The Dabur ad in the Times of India newspaper even carried a QR code that took consumers to a shopping link on the Amazon India website, which captures about a third of domestic online sales. Karthik Srinivasan, a communications consultant, called the advertising strategies of Dabur and others “moment marketing.” “How can we gain from that sentiment at least for this week and next? That’s literally what all these brands are doing,” he said. Others using a similar tactic included Amul, India’s largest dairy, which has published cartoons featuring “Made in India” products on its social media accounts, with one animated ad showing its mascot holding an Indian flag and a slab of butter.

{"content": "A wave of panic and confusion has spread through communities and the global tech industry, following US President Donald Trump’s surprise order imposing a $100,000 fee for the H-1B visa, impacting the largest group of beneficiaries of the skilled-worker program. The initial announcement on Friday ignited immediate and widespread confusion, culminating in chaotic scenes like the one aboard an Emirates flight from San Francisco to Dubai. The plane was stuck on the tarmac for three hours as H-1B holders scrambled to understand if they would be able to re-enter the country. Video of the incident verified by CNN appears to show the captain attempting to calm the nerves of worried passengers on board. “Due to the current circumstances, obviously they’re unprecedented for us here at Emirates,” he can be heard saying over the speaker of the plane as confused passengers check their phones. “We are aware that a number of passengers do not wish to travel with us. That’s perfectly fine.” CNN has contacted Emirates for a response. Masud Rana, who was on the flight and filmed the video, called the situation “complete chaos,” in an Instagram post, adding it created “panic among many – particularly Indian passengers – who even chose to leave the aircraft.” Washington has justified its latest immigration crackdown as a necessary measure to curb what it describes as of the program and to encourage the hiring of American workers. The H-1B visa is a work visa that’s valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years. Economists have argued the program allows US companies to maintain competitiveness and grow their business, creating more jobs in the US. But Trump’s new move is set to disproportionately impact skilled professionals from India, who have consistently accounted for the majority of approved applications in recent years, threatening to upend the career paths of hundreds of thousands of individuals and disrupt the business models of tech firms reliant on global talent. The H-1B visa fee “is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Saturday, adding it hopes that the “disruptions can be addressed suitably by the US authorities.” The White House later clarified the $100,000 visa fee will apply only to new H-1B applications. For decades, the H-1B visa has served as a gateway for some of India’s brightest minds to enter the US workforce, acting as a crucial launchpad for building long-term careers in America. This has not only allowed skilled Indian professionals to contribute their expertise but in many ways, enabled them to become deeply integrated into the fabric of American innovation. The most striking evidence of this success is visible across the top leadership of today’s tech giants: Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai, IBM’s Arvind Krishna, and Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen were all born in India and earned degrees from American universities. India’s National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), a non-governmental trade association and advocacy group, the new order “can potentially have ripple effects on America’s innovation ecosystem and the wider job economy.” According to from US Citizenship and Immigration Services for the 2025 fiscal year, which ends at the end of this month, Amazon has been the leading beneficiary of the H-1B program, securing approximately 10,000 visas. The second-largest recipient was Indian tech giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), with just over 5,500 approved petitions. Under the new $100,000 visa fee, that level of hiring would translate to a staggering potential cost of $1 billion for Amazon and $550 million for TCS for a single year’s applicants. CNN has reached out to several of the largest Indian beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program for comments, including TCS, Cognizant Technology Solutions, HCL Tech, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree, and Mphasis. However, according to analysts at Nomura, these IT service providers are not expected to simply absorb the cost. In a research note, the Japanese financial services group predicted the fee will likely accelerate a strategic shift towards increased offshoring and automation. It also forecast a rise in hiring in “near-shore” locations like Mexico and Canada, with the costly H-1B visa being reserved only for “extremely critical roles” where local talent is unavailable. The visa announcement represents a new front in the Trump administration’s escalating economic pressure on India. The move follows last month’s on Indian goods, which the White House justified as a punitive measure for India’s importation of Russian oil. “Service exports have finally been dragged into the ongoing global trade and tech war,” wrote Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services, in a note on Sunday. However, Arora also argued that the policy could have an unexpected upside for India, potentially bringing talent back home. While it could concentrate top professionals within India’s largest tech firms, she said it could also “catalyze India’s transformation into a more powerful global innovation and delivery hub.” Mumbai resident Ashok Gupta agrees. “It is a loss for America not India,” he told Reuters. “Those people who go abroad and can’t pay that much money, they will open their offices here. When they will work here, India, which is already on the way of progress, will progress more.” CNN’s Martin Goillandeau contributed reporting", "tags": ["workers", "panic", "trump", "india", "country", "hike"]},

{"content": "Relentless coughing echoes through the Mumbai suburb of Govandi, where families live cramped under tarpaulin and salvaged wood. The narrow lanes are waterlogged and airless, and here in India’s financial capital, a deadly disease is lurking at every door. Doctors on the ground estimate that tuberculosis has infiltrated almost every second home of this eastern urban compound, killing residents and robbing many families of their livelihoods. The local crisis is a microcosm of a national health care crisis. India is home to 27% of the world’s TB cases and records an average of two deaths related to the infectious disease every three minutes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The government has pledged to eliminate the disease by the end of this year – but experts say that goal is dangerously out of reach – with health care system gaps and socioeconomic barriers stalling efforts. Mehboob Sheikh was diagnosed with TB six months ago – more than a decade after his wife died of the disease. For him, the realities of living with it are far too real. “I have lost a lot of weight, I can barely walk now, and I get breathless if I speak more,” he told CNN, his gaunt face and hollow eyes symptoms of his plight. The disease has already cost him his job at a printing press – the relentless fatigue and weakness left him unable to cope with the long shifts on his feet. Sheikh has been on an extended nine-month course of antibiotics, but with just three months of that treatment left, his body is still frail. Any sign of a recovery is hard to see. His children – malnourished, vulnerable and too young to understand – hover around while he coughs. Once earning 15,000 rupees ($171) a month, he now struggles to pay their school fees. “If my body holds on, I will keep living. If not… that’s the end.” In 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned global health circles by pledging to eliminate TB by 2025 – five years ahead of the WHO’s global target. Elimination means cutting new TB cases by 80% and deaths by 90% compared with 2015 levels. Experts viewed the government’s 2025 target as a monumental challenge, and just months ahead of the deadline, TB remains one of India’s most stubborn public health crises. India’s struggle with the disease, experts say, is fueled by a potent combination of biology, poverty and systemic health care gaps. “We are a high-burden nation,” said Dr. Lancelot Pinto, an expert in lungs and the respiratory system, in Mumbai. “We do not necessarily have all the resources in place to scale up and eliminate TB by 2025.” The bacteria that causes the disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has haunted humanity for millennia, with traces found in Egyptian mummies. It can remain dormant inside the body for years and develop resistance to drugs, making it difficult to eradicate. The disease thrives in India’s densely populated, impoverished pockets, where people have little access to consistent medical care. After 10 years working in Govandi, health worker Pramila Pramod says the number of TB patients she sees every month has remained the same. The suburb’s alleys create the perfect transmission pathway, with no cross-ventilation, open drains clogged with garbage, and families of six huddled in single rooms. Fear of social stigma means some patients hide diagnoses from neighbors, schools, even spouses. “Sometimes there is a young girl of marriage age. (Her) parents won’t tell anyone she has TB,” said Pramod, who volunteers at Alert India, a non-governmental organization that works with people affected by infectious diseases. “How will they find a boy for her otherwise?” she recalls them asking. This vulnerability is exacerbated by a struggling health care system where the public sector is plagued by decades of underinvestment, staff shortages and outdated facilities. The country’s vast but unregulated private sector, while providing essential and crucial services, can be costly to access. India’s diagnostic strategy is another major hurdle. Nearly three-quarters of diagnoses still depend on sputum microscopy, a method first introduced around 140 years ago, that can miss active cases. The more modern molecular tests – which accurately detect the bacteria’s DNA – are used in a little over 1 in 4 diagnoses, according to Pinto. This gap means countless infections go untreated and dangerous, drug-resistant strains spread undetected. “So, unless we detect and treat proactively – not just wait for symptoms – we’ll continue to miss cases,” Pinto said. Chest aches, fevers, debilitating headaches and chills pained 15-year-old Sufiya Syed for more than a year before doctors finally diagnosed her two months ago. As TB took over her body, her weight dropped from 88 pounds to 55 pounds (40 kilograms to 25 kilograms). During that time, she still went to school. Now, she says she can’t focus on her studies, with nausea and sleepless nights leaving her body struggling to battle the disease. “Every day when I wake up, I feel like I am going faint and completely black out,” she said. “Sometimes I don’t have food for four or five days. My mom forces me to eat.” The government has ramped up efforts by offering free TB testing and medicines through public health facilities, aiming to ensure early diagnosis and treatment, reaching even the most vulnerable populations. Some progress has been made. India has reduced cases by 17.7% since 2015, nearly double the global average decline, and deaths have dropped from 28 to 22 per 100,000 people, according to data from India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. But with just months to go until the government’s end-of-2025 deadline, its promise is unraveling. Major challenges, including a shortage of staff to maintain comprehensive treatment, vulnerability in mapping in high-risk areas and poor health-seeking behavior, have allowed the disease to persist, according to a 2023 parliamentary report on the government’s eradication push. The Covid-19 pandemic worsened matters. Lockdowns halted screenings, disrupted medicine supplies and diverted health workers, the report said. CNN has contacted the Indian government’s Directorate General of Health Services for a response. For years, diagnosing TB in India’s remote communities has been a losing race against time, where vast distances to clinics, a chronic shortage of radiologists and a reliance on outdated sputum tests meant infections festered undetected, often until they were dangerously advanced. Since 1998, USAID filled some of the gap in India’s TB fight, channeling more than $140 million to fund grassroots networks in the nation’s hardest-to-reach corners. But recent US funding cuts have threatened to unravel these hard-won gains. While not publicly acknowledging the shortfall, India has boosted domestic budgets and is deploying an arsenal of new tools, including AI-powered X-rays, mobile testing vans and drones ferrying samples. Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to speed up the fight against TB. Tools like Qure.ai’s chest X-ray software can rapidly scan lung images and flag patients who may have active TB – a critical step in countries where trained radiologists are scarce. Confirmatory tests that analyze sputum or detect TB at the molecular level are more accurate, but they require labs, equipment, and time – resources often unavailable in slums and rural India. Integrated in portable machines, AI-powered X-rays help bridge that gap by flagging potential TB cases, allowing health workers to quickly refer those patients for confirmatory tests, reducing delays that often cost lives. Health experts caution, however, that the scans do not diagnose TB or reveal whether the disease is drug-sensitive or drug-resistant. Instead, they function as a screening and triage tool – catching cases earlier, reducing the number missed by basic symptom checks, and ensuring that patients are referred for proper sputum or molecular testing before starting treatment. That speed and reach matter in India, the world’s most populated country, where crowded living conditions make early detection crucial to stopping the spread of TB. “These machines weigh less than 3.5 kilos and can be carried in a backpack,” said Qure.ai’s chief medical officer for global health, Dr. Shibu Vijayan. “They run on batteries, so you can screen an entire community in one day without needing power.” The devices are making it easier to reach people who might otherwise fall through the cracks. In the capital Delhi, for instance, the Clinton Health Access Initiative has deployed more than 30 backpack-sized machines in harder-to-access areas, and hundreds more across the country. “We know that certain groups are most vulnerable – slum dwellers, migrant workers, people exposed to dust,” Vijayan said. “The tiny X-rays make it possible to offer them tests in their community settings.” Cost is another breakthrough: the portable units are half the price of traditional hospital X-ray machines. The Indian government has embraced the approach, incorporating AI screening into its national strategy. It has performed nearly 5 million X-rays with the devices, according to Vijayan, and officials are procuring additional devices. “Having the target and getting things aligned is as important as meeting the deadline itself,” Pinto said. “As long as it’s leading us in the right direction, we should consider these small victories as victories and push harder.” But for people like Sheikh, there is little to celebrate. He continues his free treatment at a government hospital every month, with his son helping to bring his medicines home. But the help ends there. He says he has not received any monthly cash assistance that TB patients qualify for as part of a federal government program. “No one has come to help us,” he said. “I have no money left. I have to support and feed myself while I am alive.”", "tags": ["tb", "eliminate", "country", "government"]},

Feng and her group had set off from Youpa Village, in Tibet’s Shigatze prefecture, for their trek through the scenic Gama Valley on the eastern side of Mount Everest on October 1. But three days in, the freak blizzard struck. Feng was among hundreds of trekkers who had to evacuate after unusually high snowfall collapsed tents and covered trails on Saturday evening, leaving hikers stranded at roughly 16,400 feet (5,000 metres). About 580 trekkers and more than 300 local guides and porters had safely arrived back in the small township of Qudang, Chinese state news agency Xinhua said late Tuesday night. Feng – an avid hiker – wasn’t worried when it started snowing because her group was well equipped. But as the storm grew more intense, with thunder and lightning rattling the mountain range, she became concerned. “By midnight, the snow was getting heavier, and my sleeping bag wasn’t cutting it. There was condensation dripping inside, making it damp,” she said. “So, I had to go out and shovel snow, only to find my teammates were buried too. We all had to dig together, which was tough since we had no tools — just used our cooking pots!” More than fell at the summit of Mount Everest Saturday, according to estimates from — nearly three times the average weekly snowfall for this time of year. October is a busy season for hiking around Everest, when skies tend to clear after the monsoon season. This week also coincides with China’s Golden Week holiday. “The weather this year is not normal. The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly,” Chen Geshuang, another trekker who was evacuated to Qudang, told Reuters news agency. “It was so wet and cold in the mountains, and hypothermia was a real risk.” Videos posted to Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu showed hikers shoveling snow off buried tents in blustery whiteout conditions. After a “scary” night, on Sunday morning Feng and her friends began hiking down the mountain on their own, ditching their tent and gear for lighter packs. At about 6:30 p.m. local time they reached the foot of the mountain, where government officials and locals awaited them, Feng said. The heavy snowfall follows a week of extreme weather across the Himalayan region. Floods and landslides triggered by severe rain in Nepal and around Darjeeling in northeast India killed more than 70 people, Reuters reported. A South Korean trekker died after hiking the 21,246-foot (6,476-meter) Mera Peak in Nepal Saturday, Reuters reported. Reflecting on her ordeal on Everest, Feng shared one key lesson: “We have to respect nature.” CNN’s Joyce Jiang and Briana Waxman contributed reporting.", "tags": ["everest", "blizzard", "freak", "dig", "trekker", "way", "pots"]},

{"content": "From his cell in a high-security Indian prison, Lawrence Bishnoi allegedly commands an empire. His throne room is a concrete box; his scepter a smartphone smuggled in to his confines. From there, the 32-year-old kingpin stands accused of threatening a Bollywood superstar, murdering a pop icon, and orchestrating a political assassination halfway across the world. Light-skinned with a thick mustache and a cold gaze, Bishnoi has long been accused by India’s top investigative body, the National Investigation Agency, of commanding a fearsome network of more than 700 members from behind bars, where he faces a litany of charges from criminal conspiracy and extortion, to murder and terror activities. Then last month he became the face of a designated terrorist entity in Canada – after Ottawa accused India of using his gang to carry out crimes against Sikh dissidents on Canadian soil. That designation elevated Bishnoi from being one of India’s most famous mob bosses – and a household name in his homeland – to an internationally wanted kingpin. “Specific communities have been targeted for terror, violence and intimidation by the Bishnoi Gang. Listing this group of criminal terrorists gives us more powerful and effective tools to confront and put a stop to their crimes,” Canada’s Minister of Public Safety Gary Anandasangaree said in a statement Monday. Bishnoi denies many of the charges and accusations against him, and his lawyer told CNN that they will need to investigate Canada’s latest allegations. CNN has contacted Sabarmati jail in the western state of Gujarat where Bishnoi is currently held but did not receive a response. New Delhi has not publicly commented on the designation, which comes as the two countries work to repair ties after Bishnoi’s story didn’t begin in the slums of the criminal underworld. It began in the fertile fields of India’s Punjab state: the country’s “bread basket” celebrated for its vibrant culture and a deep-seated sense of local pride; but a land that has also been plagued by youth unemployment and widespread gang violence. It is there that the former student activist began his transfomation into the alleged architect of a transnational criminal enterprise. Before the world knew him as Lawrence Bishnoi, he was Balkaran Brar, and his world was confined to the dusty, meandering lanes of Dutarawali – an unassuming farming village home to just over 3,000 people, according to the 2011 census. About a seven-hour drive from the nation’s capital and an hour from India’s tense border with neighboring Pakistan, it’s a place where life revolves around the harvest. There, Bishnoi seemed destined for a middle-class life. The son of a Haryana police constable, he began his education in a convent school, where his mother had big dreams for her son. Bishnoi is well educated and comes from a “very good family,” said Jupinderjit Singh, journalist and author of the book “Who Killed Moosewala?” which chronicles one of the Bishnoi gang’s highest-profile alleged crimes  – the killing of Punjabi rapper Sidhu Moosewala. His name – a very “unusual” one for a Hindu boy, Singh noted – came from his mother, in homage to Sir Henry Lawrence, the first colonial-era British administrator of Punjab, because Bishnoi was born with very fair skin. The disconnect between Bishnoi the gangster and Bishnoi the child is starkest in his home village, where residents struggle to reconcile the two. “He was a very good boy and had a good nature,” a Dutarawali resident CNN affiliate CNN News-18 in an interview last year. “If you go to anyone in this village, no one will say anything bad about him… I don’t believe he is a gangster.” Another said Bishnoi “never spoke ill of anyone” in the village. “He treated everyone with respect,” the man told CNN News-18. But soon the lanes of his village, where he would play volleyball and cricket with the nearby kids, proved too small a stage for his ambitions. Sometime around 2010, Bishnoi left Dutarawali for Chandigarh – the bustling and modern state capital – reportedly to study law. It was there that his metamorphosis from small-town boy to gang leader began, according to a lengthy 2023 chargesheet obtained by CNN that lays out his career and the dozens of accusations stacked against him over the years. Bishnoi enrolled in Panjab University, an institution that has long served as a direct pipeline for the region’s future political strongmen and, in some cases, its most notorious criminals. For Bishnoi, this environment offered the perfect apprenticeship; the often-violent world of student politics became his personal arena, a place where he learned that dominance was won with fists and, eventually, firearms. “In no time, Lawrence Bishnoi had built a huge criminal terror network in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Rajasthan by way of their alliance with other gangs,” according to a list of Bishnoi’s charges from 2023, obtained by CNN. According to Singh, Bishnoi has cultivated the public persona of a pious man dedicated to God and justice. To support this monastic image, the gangster professes to stay off drugs, he said. This self-portrayal extended to his political identity. During a 2023 interview from behind bars with the ABP news channel, Bishnoi defined himself as a “patriot” and a “nationalist,” articulating his opposition to both Pakistan and the Khalistan movement, which pushes for a proposed Sikh homeland that would include parts of India. Bishnoi’s first time in handcuffs came when he was arrested for an alleged assault in 2010. Within two years, he had 13 criminal cases lodged against him, according to the list of charges, each brief run-in with police allegedly hardening his resolve to expand his network. The game changed in 2014, when a routine police stop in Rajasthan erupted into a shootout, landing him again in custody. Yet, even then, the law couldn’t hold him. In a daring escape a few months later, Bishnoi vanished, allegedly to settle a blood debt for a slain cousin, . In March 2015, he was captured in Punjab. This time, there would be no escape but as police would come to learn, caging Bishnoi wouldn’t end his reign. “Lawrence Bishnoi runs the entire operations of the gang from within the jail,” his chargesheet says. “He is so adept in operating from inside the jail,” it added. “His first motive… was to threaten Salman Khan and to announce revenge for the killing of the blackbuck” Jupinderjit Singh, journalist and author Bishnoi used social media to grow his gang, uploading videos and photos of his group’s criminal acts to recruit young people, according to his chargesheet. The Bishnoi Gang operates on anonymity, it added. “A person in the gang knows only the person who is above him in the hierarchy and all the gang members involved in an operation do not have every information about the rest of the members,” the chargesheet says. “The gang-members present at the time of killing also often do not know each other so that if one gets arrested, the rest of the gang members remain safe.” In the years after Bishnoi’s arrest, the alleged actions of the Bishnoi Gang only grew bolder. In 2018, he gained widespread notoriety for publicly threatening Salman Khan, a Bollywood superstar and one of India’s most recognizable men. The vendetta stemmed from Khan’s alleged 1998 poaching of two blackbuck antelopes, an animal considered sacred to Bishnoi’s gang. Bishnoi is a follower of the Bishnoi community, a Hindu group in northern India often called the “Guardians of Nature.” Its followers strictly adhere to the 29 commandments of Guru Jambheshwar, which include the sacred principles of worshiping and protecting all animals. “His first motive… was to threaten Salman Khan and to announce revenge for the killing of the blackbuck,” Singh said. Four years later, police accused him of masterminding the killing of Moosewala, a Punjabi icon whose lyrics chronicled the hardships of life on the streets. Bishnoi denies involvement in Moosewala’s murder, but in an explosive interview from behind bars, accused his close aide of orchestrating it. In the same breath, he also doubled down on his threats against Khan, declaring it his life’s goal to make the celebrity pay. Despite him spending nearly a decade in prison, Bishnoi’s reach has allegedly metastasized into a transnational criminal syndicate, operating in the United States, Dubai, and Canada, according to the chargesheet. The plot thickened last year when Canadian authorities linked Bishnoi to the targeting of Sikh separatists on its soil, including the killing of activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was gunned down in British Columbia in 2023. Nijjar was a designated terrorist in India, accused of being behind a banned militant group that sought to “radicalize the Sikh community across the world” in support of Khalistan. The movement is banned in India and considered a national security threat. India has long accused Canada – home to one of the largest Sikh populations outside India – of harboring Sikh extremists. In turn, Ottawa has accused New Delhi of sponsoring violence against Sikh politicians on its soil. Last October, during testimony to a parliamentary committee, then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said India was using “criminal organizations like the Lawrence Bishnoi gang” to carry out “violence against Canadians” who disagreed with the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India has repeatedly denied any involvement in Nijjar’s murder. Indian law enforcement officials are cooperating with Canada on the investigation, Canada’s Foreign Minister Anita Anand this month. CNN has contacted India’s foreign ministry for comment. Bishnoi’s gang, now officially designated a terrorist entity by the Canadian government, is accused of unleashing a campaign of terror upon diaspora communities. “The Bishnoi Gang engages in murder, shootings and arson, and generates terror through extortion and intimidation,” Canada’s department of public safety in a statement. “They create a climate of insecurity in these communities by targeting them, their prominent community members, businesses and cultural figures.” The World Sikh Organization in Canada cheered the designation. “The Bishnoi Gang has been a key player in India’s campaign of transnational repression against Sikhs in Canada,” including Nijjar’s assassination, the group alleged in a The designation grants Canadian authorities sweeping new powers to freeze assets, block funding, and prosecute anyone associated with the group. But even with dozens of criminal cases against him Bishnoi seems unperturbed by the labels associated with him. “I don’t feel bad being called a gangster, it’s the identity God gave me,” Bishnoi said to ABP in 2024. “After spending nine years in jail I don’t dream of becoming good, I’m good just the way I am.”", "tags": ["canada", "india", "terror", "claims", "prison"]},
{"content": "Little kids line up in white graduation caps and gowns. Family members pose for formal photos at a wedding. Cousins laugh as they cut into the frosting of a giant birthday cake. These scenes from Amar Shah’s childhood flash across the screen in a new film. And they share something in common. All the photos were taken at motels owned by Indian immigrant families. Shah grew up in that world. His parents were in the gas station business. Family members and close friends owned motels. But Shah didn’t want to follow in their footsteps. “I saw it as rough, blue-collar work,” he says, “and I felt a little embarrassed by it.” But now Shah, 45, says he sees things differently. And he’s hoping others will, too. A new short film he co-directed and narrates, “The Patel Motel Story,” premiered at New York’s Tribeca Festival in June. And this month, it’s showing at festivals across the US. The film begins with what Shah calls a “mind-blowing” detail about Indian immigrants and their descendants: “We control over in the US — from the roadside motels all the way up to the Four Seasons — even though we’re just .” The motels that were a constant backdrop of his childhood are part of something much larger than he’d realized as a kid. “My relatives in Central Florida who stayed back to run the motels weren’t stuck,” Shah says. “They were quietly building real estate empires.” Shah says the filmmaking team set out to answer a simple question: “How did all of this begin?” The answer they found was surprising. A press kit promoting the film makes an eye-catching point: “The biggest name in the hotel business isn’t Hilton, Marriott, or even Ritz — it’s Patel.” The filmmakers call it “the greatest immigration story never told.” The Asian American Hotel Association that more than 33,000 hotels and motels owned by its members create millions of jobs and generate billions of dollars in revenue every year. Indian Americans’ role in the hotel industry isn’t a totally unknown story. The phenomenon has been . It’s been a plot point in and a . And it’s gotten a shout-out in comedian Hasan Minhaj’s standup routine. “Have you ever noticed that every motel you’ve ever stayed at are all owned by Indian people? Look at the name tag: ‘Patel.’ They’re all from one part of India, and they’re all related,” Minhaj quipped in his 2022 Netflix special. The joke overstated things slightly, as Shah notes in his “Patel Motel Story” narration (“They’re not all related, and they don’t even have the same name”). But many hotel owners do hail from India’s Gujarat state. And many share the last name Patel, a common surname in the region. Even as the topic has gotten more attention, it’s still not a lesson commonly taught in American history textbooks. And Shah and his fellow filmmakers say they realized there was more to the story that deserved to be told. “We learned about the Mayflower. … All through our lives, we learned how every other piece of America has gotten here, but we never heard our own parents’ stories,” says Milan Chakraborty, one of the film’s producers. Making the film, Shah says, has been a deeply personal journey. Shah’s family also came to the US from Gujarat. He grew up as a self-described “counter kid,” helping out while at his parents’ gas station convenience store in DeLand, Florida. The “counter kid” scene, he says, was closely intertwined with the world of “hotel kids,” the children of hotel owners who came of age answering phones, greeting guests and cleaning rooms alongside their families. Once it was time for him to choose his own career path, Shah moved in a different direction. He studied journalism in college and became a television writer and producer for ESPN, then went on to work for the NFL and numerous other companies and sports teams. It was only recently that he looked back on his own biography as he searched for stories to tell. “As you get older, you start to see it differently. You understand the sacrifices and the grit it took for that generation to build a life for us,” Shah says. And as he tried to trace the origin of Indian Americans’ dominance in the hotel industry, Shah turned to a connection from his past. A family friend helped show him around the halls of AAHOACON, the owners’ association’s annual convention. “It’s like the Super Bowl of hospitality,” Shah says, comparing the event to a cross between a massive trade show and an Indian wedding. The group and its nearly 20,000 members have become so influential that top politicians from both sides of the aisle have given speeches at the conference. Shah, co-director Rahul Rohatgi and Chakraborty went to the Dallas convention in 2021, hoping to make connections for their project. And it wasn’t long before they met dozens of hotel owners – all with a story to tell. But a central mystery remained: How did this entrepreneurial success story begin? Clues started to emerge from interviews as they met more people, Rohatgi says. But still, connecting the dots was difficult. “It was a lot of work for us to try to dig through and figure out … who has the right lead,” he says. A historian in California helped them find a crucial piece of the puzzle. The filmmakers learned that Mahendra K. Doshi, a longtime journalist, was meticulously documenting the stories of hotel-owning families in his book, “ : How the Patels from Gujarat Established the Hotel Business in California, 1942-1960.” “He’d spent eight years working on this amazing biography of all of these forgotten people,” Shah says. One of the focal points of Doshi’s book was a man whose name the filmmakers had previously seen mentioned in passing: Kanji Manchhu Desai. While other accounts had described Desai’s role, Doshi’s research painted a far more detailed picture. From Doshi, the filmmakers soon learned that the man who’s come to be known as the godfather of Indian-owned hotels in the US had an unexpected backstory. Desai was originally from Gujarat. But he came to the US in 1934 from Trinidad, where he’d worked for years as a peddler before setting out for a better job. He obtained a business visa to enter the US, according to Doshi, but then stayed long after the visa expired, becoming an undocumented immigrant who found work in the fields of California and later, according to Doshi, becoming “the first Patel hotelier.” When the Japanese American owner of a hotel where he was staying in Sacramento, California, was forced to move to an internment camp during World War II, she asked Desai and his friends to watch over her property. Desai embraced the role “with energy and enthusiasm,” Doshi writes, manning the front desk “while his friends helped him with the daily hotel chores.” And after the war, Desai leased his own hotel in San Francisco, the Hotel Goldfield. There, he welcomed many a newly arrived immigrant and became known for advice he frequently offered to others from his home state: “If you’re a Patel, lease a hotel.” Doshi’s research gave the filmmakers the foundation they were looking for. From there, they went on to interview descendants of numerous families who Desai helped. Something struck Shah as he learned more about Desai’s story. “As I began to talk to people he directly helped and their kin, it showed how big of a role this man played in this huge billion-dollar story,” Shah says. “Yet he was this sort of forgotten undocumented immigrant.” Jyoti Sarolia’s family was among many that received Desai’s advice. Her great uncles came to the US from India in 1952. Before they set sail, Desai had written to them, telling them about hotels in America. “He would write a letter saying, ‘This place is great for business. It’s a new opportunity. I think you can settle here,’” Sarolia says. After families like hers arrived, Desai provided them with housing in his San Francisco hotel and sometimes handshake loans to help finance their first hotel leases. “Now, if you got our family together that’s in the hotel business, there’s 400 of us. We’re in four generations deep now,” she says. In “The Patel Motel Story,” Sarolia gives a glimpse of what it was like growing up in the hotel world: “I remember answering my first phone when I was 9. By 11, I was putting pillowcases in beds. By 14, I was able to run a hotel by myself.” It was hard work, but also a lot of fun, she told CNN. “You felt like you had a mansion – all these corridors and extra rooms,” she says. “It was our playground. We were playing hide and seek and tag. I learned how to ride a bike in the hallway.” Now more than 70 years after Desai’s encouragement first helped her family find their footing, Sarolia is running a company with eight hotels in its portfolio. The management company’s name is Ellis Hospitality Group, named for , the famed port where her great uncles and millions of other immigrants took their first steps in America. Sarolia’s perspective is one of several that viewers of “The Patel Motel Story” will hear as they watch the film at festivals this month in , , and . This film largely focuses on Desai’s story – including a tragic twist at the end of his life. But the filmmakers hope more Indian American hotel owners after hearing about the project. “Our parents’ generation is getting older, and we need to remember their stories,” Shah says. “And their stories are actually far more extraordinary than we ever thought they could be.” What’s next? Maybe a docuseries, or maybe even a feature film. One thing is clear: There are many more stories to tell. As the credits roll, the short film nods to that possibility, presenting a series of clips of different hotel owners proudly introducing themselves to the audience. Some have southern drawls. One wears a cowboy hat. All of them are American. And all of them are named Patel.", "tags": ["simple", "american", "story", "immigration", "question", "greatest", "hotels"]},

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in . Turkey may be famous for its , but the popular dish is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Turkish cuisine. Covering over 300,000 square miles, the European destination’s rich and diverse food is largely thanks to its landscape. Plateaus and plains of fertile soil formed by now extinct volcanoes, snow-covered mountains and fast-flowing rivers lend themselves to a rich and varied table. This includes olive oil based dishes from the , hearty pastries from central Anatolia, subtle spicy flavors from the east and southeast, and that’s just for starters. Traditional Turkish foods rely less on seasonings and more on tasty fresh ingredients rolled, kneaded, shaped and cooked to perfection with care, dedication and passion. In fact, the Turks love their food so much they even write songs about it: “Domates, Biber, Patlican” by Anatolian rock star Baris Manco translates to “Tomatoes, Pepper, Eggplant.” Here are 23 of the top Turkish foods beyond the basic kebab: Antalya’s piyaz salad is one of the Turkish city’s most famous dishes — and its secret ingredient is its . They’re not just any old butter bean, but a small version known as candir, named after the inland province where they’re grown. Delicate and flavorful, candir are mixed, together with tahini thinned with a little water, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, garlic, flat-leaf parsley and olive oil. In the very traditional version, a soft-boiled egg is roughly chopped up and mixed through just before serving. According to legend, this dish was dreamed up by an unhappily married woman named Ezo who was trying to win over her mother-in-law via her stomach. She concocted a zesty soup consisting of red lentils, domato salca (tomato paste — sweet or hot), grated fresh tomatoes and onions, served with dried mint and pul biber (chili flakes) sprinkled on top. There’s no proof it actually worked, but just in case, ezogelin (which literally translates to bride Ezo), originating from a small village near Gaziantep, is still the food of choice for brides-to-be. Turkish cuisine incorporates a huge range of vegetable dishes known as zeytinyagli yemegi — foods cooked in olive oil. The majority are vegetable based and include green beans, artichokes and of course, eggplants. One of the tastiest eggplant offerings is sasuka. Here silky purple skinned cubes of green flesh are cooked with zucchinis, garlic, tomatoes and chili — how much of the latter depending on where in Turkey it’s made. Kisir is a salad made from fine bulgur wheat, tomatoes, garlic, parsley and mint. There are numerous versions from all over Turkey, but the Antakya one includes nar eksisi (sour pomegranate molasses) and pul biber (hot red chili flakes). They like it hot down south. Known to Diyarbakir locals as belluh, mercimek kofte is a vegetarian delight. Made from red lentils, fine bulgur, salt, finely chopped onion, scallions, tomato and aci biber salca (hot red pepper paste) and crushed cilantro, they come in handy bite-sized servings. Just pop one of these nuggets of flavor onto a lettuce leaf, add a squeeze of lemon juice, roll it up and munch away. In the Isparta version of yaprak dolma, rice is cooked with tomatoes, a bunch of parsley, onion, garlic, tomato paste, olive oil, black pepper, salt and water. A spoonful of this mixture is placed on a vine leaf, folded in and carefully rolled by hand into neat little cylinders. While leaves are sold at most street markets, the best ones come from a neighbor’s tree, usually picked at midnight. Yaprak dolma are part of Turkish Aegean cuisine and sometimes include a pinch of cinnamon in the mix, a nod to the Rum people, Greeks born in Turkey. Meatballs are so much more than just balls of meat in Turkish cuisine.  Each style brings its own unique serve of history. One of the best known is Inegol kofte, invented by one Mustafa Efendi. Originally from Bulgaria, he migrated to Inegol in northwest Turkey in the 19th century. Unlike other Turkish kofte, his mix uses only ground beef or lamb and breadcrumbs, seasoned with onions. Located in northwest Turkey, Bursa is famous for three things — silk, the ski fields of Uludag and a type of kebab called Iskender. Apparently a gentleman of the same name first cooked this dish for workers in the city’s Kayhan Bazaar back in 1867. Thin slices of doner meat are reverently laid over pieces of plump pide bread, smothered in freshly made tomato sauce, baptized with a dash of sizzling melted butter and served with a portion of tangy yoghurt, grilled tomato and green peppers. The people of Erzurum take their meat very seriously. So much so, they’re prepared to wait more than 12 hours for a sliver of hot and tasty lamb cag kebab. First the meat is smeared with a mix of onions, salt and black pepper and left to marinate for half a day.  Then it’s fed onto a long skewer and cooked horizontally over a wood fire. Divine on its own, cag kebab is also served wrapped in flat lavas bread with slices of tomato, white onion and long thin green peppers called sivri. Hamsi, aka European anchovy, is a staple in Turkish Black Sea kitchen. In the city of Rize, the slender fishes are prepared with rice to make Hamsili Pilav. This dish is cooked in a stock made from fried onions, butter, peanuts, Turkish allspice and raisins, which is mixed with fresh parsley and dill. Then filleted anchovies are arranged over the rice and the whole lot is cooked in the oven. The town of Siirt is home to perde pilav, or curtain rice, a rice-based dish wrapped in a lush buttery dough, baked in an oven and served up hot. Usually served at weddings, perde pilav is cooked with chicken, currants, almonds, pine nuts and butter, and seasoned with salt, oregano and pepper. The shape of the dish is thought to represent the creation of a new home — the rice symbolizes fertility and the currants are for future children. The most popular type of manti, small squares of dough with various fillings, are those made in Kayseri. This central Anatolian version contains a spoonful of mince sealed into a small parcel, but they use cheese elsewhere. The manti are dropped into boiling water and topped with yoghurt and pul biber (chili flakes). Legend has it, a good Turkish housewife can make them so small that 40 fit onto one spoon. This specialty of the Nevsehir region features pottery made in Avanos, using red clay from the famous Kizilirmak River. First the clay jug is filled with beef, tomatoes, bell pepper, garlic and a knob of butter. Its opening is then sealed with a peeled slice of potato and covered in alfoil, before the jug is placed in a wood-burning oven. Once the contents are ready, the cook must hold the alfoil covered top in one hand and a small hammer in the other to break open the meal. The trick is to aim for the thin line circling the body of the vessel three quarters of the way up. Alternatively known as sac boregi, pastry cooked on a sac, a hot convex metal plate, gozleme are flat savory pockets usually filled with salty white cheese, spinach or minced beef. Although often considered village food, it takes expert handling to roll out the paper-thin dough without tearing it. The word goz means “eye,” and the name gozleme is believed to come from the dark spots that form as the pastry cooks and absorbs the oil on the sac, forming “eyes.” Pide are a firm favorite among Turks, with some of the tastiest originating in the Black Sea region. Here dough balls are stretched out into an elongated base and loaded with a choice of fillings. The most popular is sucuklu yumurta, spicy Turkish sausage and egg mixed with kasar (yellow sheep cheese) but ispanakli kasar, spinach with cheese, is equally good. It’s the crust that makes pide a winner. Cooked in a wood-fired oven, the high temperature produces a crisp crunchy base ideal for all types of ingredients. Borek, a savory pastry made from layering sheets of a fine filo-like dough called yufka, is a staple of the high plateaus of central Anatolia. It was brought to Turkey by nomadic herders hundreds of years ago, and different varieties can be found all over the country and throughout Central and Eastern Europe. Su boregi, meaning “water borek” is the most commonly available, relying on white cheese, butter, olive oil and salt for flavor. If a country can be said to run on its stomach, simit is the fuel that keeps Turkey going. They’re sold everywhere, by street vendors carrying baskets or pushing carts; in bakeries and cafes; at tram, train and metro stations; and even on ferries. It’s believed simit were created in the palace kitchens of Suleyman the Magnificent in the 1500s, but no official records exist. In October 2019, the word simit was officially recognized by the Oxford English Dictionary and the rest, as they say, is history. According to Ottoman explorer Evliya Celebi, who roamed far and wide in the 17th century, lahmacun takes its name from the Arabic word lahm-i acinli. It’s a type of pastry made from lahm, meat in Arabic, and ajin, paste. The paste consists of low fat mince mixed with tomato paste, garlic and spices smeared on a thin round of pita dough and can be made spicier on request. Served with fresh parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice, Turks have been eating this dish for more than 300 years. Cig kofte originates from Sanliurfa, taking its name from the original recipe using raw (cig) ground beef, combined with bulgur, tomato paste, onions garlic, pepper and Turkish spices. The mix was kneaded until it was declared ready, determined by throwing a piece up to the ceiling. When it stuck there, it was done. These days the meat has been wholly replaced by bulgur and sometimes ground walnuts, making for a healthier but equally tasty choice. The people of Gaziantep, also known as Antep, in Turkey’s southeastern Anatolia region, know the best baklava is made in a darkened room with a controlled temperature perfect for stacking the 40 sheets of tissue-like pastry that go into this Turkish culinary icon. Each sheet is first brushed with butter, and ground pistachios are sprinkled over every few layers. Then a honeyed syrup is poured over the contents, and the pastry is baked until golden. Different versions have enticing names such as twisted turban, nightingale’s nest, saray or palace baklava, and are all equally irresistible. Baklava can be enjoyed plain or with a dollop of kaymak, Turkey’s answer to clotted cream. Where can you find ice cream you can eat with a knife and fork? In Kahramanmaras, home of traditional Turkish dondurma, of course. Traditional dondurma (which means freezing in Turkish) is made from milk and two special ingredients: sahlep and mastic. Sahlep is a type of flour produced from orchids that provides a smooth velvety finish to the ice cream, while the mastic, a natural gum, adds chewiness. Lokum, known in English as Turkish Delight, dates back hundreds of years. However, it wasn’t until the mid-19th century that it became a hit with the Ottoman sultans. That’s when corn starch was invented and Istanbul confectioner Haci Bekir added it to the list of ingredients. This simple combination of water, starch and sugar — boiled together to produce delicate cubes flavored with rose water, pistachio and other flavors — continues to delight. This dessert from the city of Afyonkarahisar is made from a special type of dehydrated bread with a consistency similar to English crumpets. The bread is placed on a large tray and steeped in water to make it expand. Then it’s covered in a syrup made of sugar, water and lemon and simmered on the stove. The syrup is constantly spooned back over the bread to infuse it with a sweet sticky texture. When ready, it’s turned upside down onto a serving dish and eaten with kaymak, thick Turkish cream.

{"content": "President Donald Trump saw — but he also gave New York Attorney General Letitia James her best single day of fundraising in a nearly 30-year political career. A source familiar with James’s political operation told CNN she brought in $567,000 from over 24,000 donors in the 24 hours after she was indicted Thursday afternoon on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. Most of the fundraising came in response to emails her political operation was sending out to capitalize on the news, though some donations came in on their own. Her to the indictment drew 4.3 million views on X in that same 24 hours. Trump had long called for James to be indicted and her team had long prepared for it. In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, national and New York Democrats rushed to support her, led by Zohran Mamdani, whom both on the New York City mayoral campaign and in gearing up for governing if he wins. Shortly after learning of the federal indictment, Mamdani summoned what is sometimes described as the sisterhood of Black elected officials in New York City. “We are standing in front of the same courthouse where Attorney General Tish James did her job, upholding the law and holding Donald Trump accountable,” Mamdani said at a Friday press conference in Lower Manhattan with some of those Black female officials. “This is a blatant miscarriage of justice; this is a shameless act of political retribution.” A Queens native, Trump and his allies have repeatedly reshaped New York City politics, from against Mayor Eric Adams to from the nation’s largest city if Mamdani wins. James and Trump have a long history, with the state attorney general and a roughly $500 million penalty that was later struck down by an appeals court. So do James and Andrew Cuomo, now running against Mamdani as an independent mayoral candidate with Trump’s implicit support. James led into sexual misconduct allegations that ultimately resulted in Cuomo’s resignation as New York governor. Cuomo that he felt he had “never crossed the line with anyone.” Several Mamdani allies ripped into Cuomo for omitting any reference to James in a post on X Thursday night decrying partisanship in the justice system after the indictment was announced. “Her name is Tish James,” said Adrienne Adams, the city council speaker who also ran in the Democratic primary. “She saw through you in the beginning and she saw through you in the end. At the end of both spectrums, Donald Trump is still pulling the strings on your vocal cords.” Cuomo and his top aides, some of whom worked for him in the governor’s office and now on his mayoral campaign, still harbor deep resentment towards James. In recent months, Cuomo has described the investigation led by James’ office as “politically motivated.” The state of New York for the legal defense of Cuomo and several officials who worked in the executive chamber from three ex-employees who have sued them. “Sir, my message to you is we need to meet this moment,” said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, addressing Cuomo. “That is simply not the energy that we need right now. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment for our city and our country.” Councilwoman Crystal Hudson, a Democrat who represents the same Brooklyn district James represented in the City Council when she was first elected to public office more than two decades ago, highlighted the exodus of Black women from the workforce since Trump’s election and suggested the indictment was racially motivated. “You have men who quite literally cannot even address the fact that this woman, and specifically a Black woman, is being attacked and maligned the way that Trump is attacking her and maligning her, it speaks volumes,” Hudson told CNN. Hours after Mamdani’s rally, Cuomo issued a new statement calling for universal condemnation of politicizing the justice system. The statement included a mention of James but said Cuomo too had been the victim of politically motivated investigations. “The weaponization and politicization of the justice system is wrong no matter which side you are on — period,” Cuomo said in the statement. “I know firsthand as the White House weaponized the DOJ against me when I was governor of New York and three other democratic states during the height of COVID and it’s wrong that it appears to be happening with AG James and Former FBI Director Comey — it is part of why people have lost faith in the Justice system, the cornerstone of our democracy.” Mamdani said he had spoken to James shortly after the indictment became public to reassure her of the support she had. “She told me, ‘Don’t worry about me,’” Mamdani said. “That’s indicative of an attorney general who has spent all of her time worrying about the people of the state.”", "tags": ["sees", "democratic", "james", "support", "letitia", "surge", "indictment"]},

But the country music icon, actress, activist and humanitarian posted a on Wednesday to clear up rumors that had been going around to the contrary. “I wanted to say, I know lately everybody thinks that I’m sicker than I am,” Parton, 79, said in the video from a set where she was filming a commercial for the Grand Ole Opry. “Do I look sick to you? I’m workin’ hard here.” Dressed in a red and black fringe top, the “9 to 5” star added that she “wanted to put everybody’s mind at ease” because many seemed “real concerned, which I appreciate.” “And I appreciate your prayers because I’m a person of faith. I can always use the prayers for anything and everything, but I want you to know that I’m ok,” she added in the video, which was captioned “I ain’t dead yet!” Parton went on to acknowledge that she’s had “some problems” health-wise, which she had mentioned last month when she in Las Vegas. She then elaborated on the reasons behind those issues. “Back when my husband Carl was very sick – that was for a long time – and then when he passed, I didn’t take care of myself,” she said. “So I let a lot of things go that I should have been taking care of. So, anyway, when I got around to it, the doctor said ‘We need to take care of this, we need to take care of that.’ Nothing major, but I did have to cancel some things so I could be closer to home.” Parton’s husband of nearly 60 years Carl Dean . Heightened concerns about Parton’s health were spurred on Tuesday, when her sister Freida that she’d been “up all night praying” for the “Jolene” singer. “Many of you know she hasn’t been feeling her best lately. I truly believe in the power of prayer, and I have been lead to ask all of the world that loves her to be prayer warriors and pray with me,” Freida Parton’s post read. “She’s strong, she’s loved, and with all the prayers being lifted for her, I know in my heart she’s going to be just fine. Godspeed, my sissy Dolly. We all love you!” Mass panic ensued, reasonably. But someone apparently had words with Freida, because she on Facebook later to tell everyone that she didn’t intend for her words to spark worry. “I didn’t mean to scare anyone or make it sound so serious when asking for prayers for Dolly,” she wrote. “It was nothing more than a little sister asking for prayers for her big sister.” Later, another Parton sister appeared. This one was named Stella. “My sister Freida is always concerned when one of her siblings isn’t feeling well so she ask for prayers on Dolly’s behalf,” she explained. She then went on to say she was mad about being asked for health updates on her sister. To those with genuine concern for my big sister Dolly’s well being, she posted a video last week to share with her fans that she has had kidney stones and is getting treatment. My sister Freida is always concerned when one of her siblings isn’t feeling well so she ask for… Fans were on particularly high alert because this call for prayers came soon after the death of Parton’s husband.

Parton was set to perform six shows at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in December in her first Las Vegas residency in . Those concerts were rescheduled for September 2026.

{"content": "Sitting atop her lion, the Hindu goddess Durga wields a celestial weapon in each of her 10 hands. But her target isn’t the usual demon of deceit, Mahishasura. She’s taking aim at a different perceived foe representing the forces of evil: a striking figure with a blond coif, a rippling torso and a face modeled on US President Donald Trump. Unveiled last week in the eastern state of West Bengal during the Hindu festival of Durga Puja, known as Durga Pujo by Bengali Hindus, the sculpture’s symbolism was impossible to ignore. In a celebration that honors the triumph of good over evil, the statue was more than just political satire. It was a symbol of a once tightly woven friendship now frayed by Trump’s attempts to . “India and America had good relations previously but ever since Trump has come, he’s trying to suppress India, to push us over, to squash us,” Sanjay Basak, a member of the organizing committee of the Durga Puja installment in the city of Murshidabad, told CNN. “That’s why we have depicted Trump as this demon, vanquished by the powerful mother Durga.” During the five-day festival of Durga Puja, entire cities transform into a sprawling, open-air art gallery where the mythological battle between the goddess and her demon is reimagined to reflect contemporary anxieties. Over the years, these installations have tackled everything from the migrant crisis to wars with neighboring Pakistan. “Osama Bin Laden had been a popular choice post 9/11,” said Sushovan Sircar, a consultant who makes social media reels about Bengali culture and spends his time between New Delhi and Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal state. After deadly border clashes between India and China in 2020, another installation Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the villain’s role, pushing the boundaries of diplomatic commentary through religious art. “It is in this vein that a pandal (pavilion) decided to depict Trump as an asur (demon), as an ostensible expression of a popular sentiment of the people,” Sircar said. It wasn’t always this way. Six years ago, Trump stood hand in hand with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Houston’s NRG Stadium as thunderous chants from 50,000 people celebrated two right-wing populists with a shared flair for turning diplomatic relations into grand spectacles. The show of political partnership known as the “Howdy Modi!” rally was mirrored at the subsequent “Namaste Trump” event in Ahmedabad in Gujarat the following February, solidifying a public narrative of a seemingly unbreakable personal alliance. But lately their friendship has been tested by Trump’s return to office. Earlier this year, Trump publicly derided New Delhi, labeling the Indian economy as “dead” while imposing some of the administration’s highest-ever tariffs on the nation. Half of the 50% levies are Trump’s punishment for India’s ramped-up purchases of Russian oil following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The other half are part of Trump’s signature “America First” campaign to reduce US trade deficits. India shot back, calling the tariffs “unfair” and “unjustified,” while pointing out the hypocrisy of Trump’s move. US and Europe, it said, still trade with Russia on other products such as fertilizers and chemicals. But the Trump administration doubled down. A White House official in August described Russia’s war in Ukraine as “Modi’s war,” ramping up pressure on New Delhi to cut economic ties with the Kremlin. India repeatedly defended its purchases of Russian crude and the statement “inaccurate and misleading.” Then in September, Trump’s surprise order to impose a $100,000 fee for applications felt to many like a personal attack on Indian talent and ambition, as the largest group of beneficiaries of the skilled-worker program. “Now that Trump is just imposing tariffs upon tariffs upon tariffs, this is the big issue of the day. So, it’s only apt that we should depict it as such.” Sanjay Basak It is this sense of betrayal that found a potent artistic outlet in the form of the demon statue. “Trump as Mahishasura is serving a political message to the people who are visiting the pandal (pavilion) and the mass media organizations who are covering it,” said Kolkata resident Tuneer Mukherjee. This blending of art and politics is characteristic of Bengali culture, he said, offering a simple but powerful message: Trump and his administration’s “regressive agenda” have become the modern demon to be slain by the divine mother, Durga. For three months, Basak, from the organizing committee of the Trump installation, said their team worked in near-total secrecy, a deliberate tactic to create an element of suspense ahead of its reveal. “The identity of the demon was a closely guarded secret,” he said. So closely, in fact, that the final, unmistakable features of Trump were only sculpted in the last seven days, hidden from view until the final moment. When a video of the completed installation surfaced online, the response was electric, said Basak. “Thousands and thousands” of people flocked to the pavilion, forming queues that snaked through the neighborhood, he added. For Basak, the overwhelming turnout was validation. “It really is something that resonated with a lot of people,” he said, “or at least, something everyone wanted to see for themselves.” In West Bengal, art has never been just about decoration; it is a language for dialogue, a weapon for dissent, and the primary medium for social and political debate. As a hotbed of resistance against its British colonizers, Bengal’s freedom struggle was fought as much with ideas as with weapons. It was poet and novelist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee who gave the movement its rallying cry with the song “Vande Mataram” (Hail to the Motherland), while the work of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore infused the resistance with its intellectual and spiritual soul. This deep-seated political consciousness didn’t fade with independence. It was further institutionalized during more than three decades of local communist party governance, and today, its legacy unfolds on the streets. This towering statue of Trump is one of several politically charged installations that depicted the US leader or symbols of his economic agenda as the demon. Worshipped by millions of Hindus as the mother of the universe, the goddess Durga embodies a powerful duality: her spear and club symbolize both fierce prowess and delicate motherliness. And within India’s Bengali community, particularly in its cultural epicenter of West Bengal, Durga Puja  has evolved beyond a purely religious celebration into one of the region’s most deliberate forms of public discourse and socio-political commentary. “This kind of critique and social commentary is something that’s a part of our culture,” said Basak, from the Trump installation’s organizing committee. “Now that Trump is just imposing tariffs upon tariffs upon tariffs, this is the big issue of the day. So, it’s only apt that we should depict it as such.”", "tags": ["demon", "year", "festival", "india", "goddess", "hindu", "slays"]},

Alexander the Great tried to conquer Termessos but failed. Today, the incredible deserted ruins of this once-powerful city, perched like a fortified eagle’s nest high in the mountains of southwestern Turkey, can be conquered by anyone willing to make the hike up here. But few people ever do. Termessos stands empty. A spectacular archeological jewel, preserved in isolation, seen only by a few handfuls of people who make the trip from the beach resorts of nearby tourism hot spot Antalya. That’s a shame for those who miss out. For those who do get to explore, it’s a major bonus. They get to wander around one of Turkey’s most impressive ancient cities all by themselves. It’s a place of incredible atmosphere: history and landscape; views and silence; nature and destruction — all combining to create one of the Mediterranean’s great unsung archaeological wonders. Here, slowly being swallowed by vegetation and worn down by time, are gigantic mausoleums, vast underground cisterns, temples, imposing city walls and a breathtaking theater perched, like Machu Picchu, on a hilltop that offers views stretching for miles all around. Despite its emptiness, Termessos is easy to reach. It only takes around 45 minutes to drive from Antalya’s traffic-snarled downtown to the gates of Mount Güllük-Termessos National Park — a protected wildlife haven that surrounds the ruins. After paying a three-euro (about $3) gate fee at the park’s entrance, visitors then face another 10-minute ride further into the pine and gorse-clad hills along a switchback road that reaches about 1,000 meters above sea level. Eventually the road emerges into what seems like an uninteresting parking lot with a public restroom. This was, in fact, at one time a giant agora, or marketplace for the city, which in its heyday 2,000 years ago would’ve been bustling with traders and citizens. It’s here where the Termessos adventure begins. And it begins with death. Hidden by vegetation at one end of the agora are the stone-strewn remains of what was clearly once a grand street leading away along the hillside. Instead of houses or shops, this was lined with the tombs of Termessos’ rich and mighty. Ancient sarcophagi carved with clues to who they once contained, like shields and spears for warriors, lie scattered. Some are small, others huge — offering clues to levels of wealth or power. Some are unfinished, their massive pedestals hinting at what would’ve been. All of them have been broken into by raiders over the centuries, their walls smashed or lids prised off despite once being locked shut with metal clasps. Tree roots and ivy creepers have also snaked through the stonework. “The thieves working here were very good at their jobs,” says Önder Uğuz, an Antalya-based art teacher and licensed guide who offers tours of Termessos, which he’s been captivated by since first coming here as a student in 1996 (“It was love at first sight!”). Reaching the heart of the ancient city involves an uphill hike along a leafy pathway that’s a little rough and steep in places. Visitors here need to be equipped with sturdy footwear and OK with mildly strenuous hiking on tricky terrain. In summer, it’s best to visit early before temperatures start to climb, and bring water. Soon the lower city walls loom into view — a first hint at how well-defended Termessos was when it was built perhaps around the fourth or fifth century BCE, long before the Romans showed up with the engineering skills that would transform the known world. Which raises the question: how did the people of Termessos do it? Uğuz laughs off the suggestion of any mystery here. We’re too caught up in the achievements of our technological age to appreciate even the basic abilities of our distant ancestors, in his opinion. “You and I, we’re nothing without our computers and social media accounts,” he says (shortly after taking a snap for his own feed). “Take those away and we are helpless. Not these people. They worked with stone for centuries. They had nothing else. Building things like this was what they knew how to do.” The people of Termessos were known as Solyms, descendants of Luwians, an ancient civilization that was spread across what is now Turkey, but largely overlooked by archaeological scholars until the past few decades. To this day, little is known about the Solyms or when they constructed their city, although with the site’s announced in 2025, that could be set to change. The Solyms, however clearly knew what they were doing. Their choice of location showed a genius for strategic thinking. Not only was it on a major trade route, enabling it to grow wealthy on goods and payments from people heading to and from the Mediterranean, its altitude and commanding views made it easy to defend. Which is why when Alexander the Great showed up around 333 BCE — when Termessos made its first real appearance in the history books — he was apparently unable to invade or blockade the city into surrender, despite multiple attempts. He reputedly called the city an “ ” Later, the Romans had more success in controlling the city. Not through force, says Uğuz, but through more insidious means, like offering autonomy under Roman “protection.” “The Romans were like the mafia,” he suggests. Climbing higher up the hillside on a rocky path sprouting with fragrant wild sage, there’s more evidence of how sophisticated life in Termessos would’ve been. To the left, there’s the marble ruins of the city’s gymnasium, a kind of college campus for trainee soldiers, complete with bathhouse and refectory. Some of the main building is still intact, with indications that impressive arches once ran across its front wall. Inside were two floors, plus a subterranean vault for storage. In front is the an area that would’ve been used for wrestling and combat training and which today is littered with pieces of the gymnasium’s terracotta roof tiles. It is, of course, mostly derelict. Termessos was believed to have been destroyed by an earthquake the exact date of which is not known, but possibly the 4th or 5th century. What remains is not the work of archeological reconstruction. It’s the genuine state the building has been left in for the past 1,600 years. Here, on our visit in in June 2024, the silence and emptiness of the place allow the imagination to wander — bringing those warriors back to life and allowing visualization of their mock battles in a place that has changed so little over time. The excavation work begun in the summer of 2025 will focus on the mausoleum, the necropolis road, ancient water structures and the Hadrian Gate, reports . “One main necropolis road stretches 400–500 meters, lined with tombs and sarcophagi, many toppled. We’ll restore podiums and reassemble them. Two waterworks structures will also undergo cleaning and repair,” the leader of the excavation, Mustafa Koçak of Antalya Bilim University, told the Turkish newspaper. Further up, the upper city walls give commanding views of the forest below and offer a good vantage point over anyone trying to sneak up for an invasion. Beyond them is more evidence of civilization. There are the remains of a covered water drainage system. And for a city that had few water sources, they are one of its most impressive assets — gigantic multi-chambered underground cisterns carved by hand into solid rock and lined with plaster. Capable of holding up to 1,500 tons of water, these cavernous containers would’ve been vital to the survival of a city that had few natural sources of H2O — especially when Alexander the Great was mounting blockades. Today, they’re filled with broken columns and other rubble, likely dumped there when the city was abandoned. There’s speculation water shortages could’ve been behind a decision to finally relocate the city elsewhere. Nearby, there’s the imposing outer wall of the bouleuterion or assembly house that would’ve been the city’s seat of power, another central agora dating back to pre-Roman times and the ruins of a colonnaded street that once housed the city’s most exclusive shops. “This is the Champs-Élysées of Termessos,” says Uğuz. Like the Parisian upscale retail boulevard, this would’ve been where the wealthy spent their cash, he explains. The finest olive oils, cloths, leather goods and items imported from all around the Mediterranean would’ve been on sale here. These are all sideshows to the city’s showstopper attraction: the theater. After a last scramble over huge slabs of marble, the view opens up onto an epic panorama of the large performance space, perched on the city’s highest point. The setting is breathtaking, with mountain ravines cascading away on either side. The sheer drop behind the theater’s upper walls is dizzying. It’s a reminder to be careful when exploring ruins that haven’t been fenced off for safety. With room for about 4,000 people, the semi-circle of stone terraces faces the ruins of what would’ve been a stage. The theater probably predated the arrival of the Romans, but was later updated along Roman lines. In Termessos, the location is particularly significant, as it sits opposite a mountain that was once sacred to the city’s inhabitants. It’s easy to see why this was such a hallowed spot, with views that, on haze-free days, stretch as far as the port of Antalya. And again, it’s a place to sit and imagine what life was like nearly 2,000 years ago, when such theaters would’ve been used by the Romans as, according to Uğuz, a propaganda tool — a soft force to keep their empire in check. As history lessons go, this is pretty spectacular. Uğuz (who can be contacted via email: onder.uguz@gmail.com) says he never tires of exploring Termessos. He also offers tours of other more popular archaeological sites in the area, but the tranquility and beauty of this hidden ancient wonder draw him back time and again. He particularly loves soaking in the vistas from the city’s upper walls. “Usually, I’m sitting there with my wife, under a juniper tree in springtime, a beautiful blue sky with this great scenery,” he says, adding that year-round, the solitude offered by Termessos is also an attraction. “For me it’s perfect. Just you and nature; little squirrels and archaeology. The only thing missing is a cold beer.”", "tags": ["eagle", "alexander", "conquer", "great", "hidden", "city", "nest"]},
{"content": "Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, . There’s a large and very dignified school in Kayaköy. There are narrow streets, lined with houses, that wend and rise up both sides of a steep valley. There’s an ancient fountain in the middle of the town. And there are churches, one with million-dollar hilltop views over the blue Aegean. But, for most of the past 100 years, there have been no people. Kayaköy, in southwestern Turkey’s Muğla Province, is a true ghost town. Abandoned by its occupants and haunted by the past. It’s a monument, frozen in time – a physical reminder of darker times in Turkey. With hillsides dotted by countless crumbling buildings slowly being swallowed by greenery, and endless views into vanished lives, it’s also a fascinating and starkly beautiful place to visit. In summer, under clear skies and blazing suns, it’s eerie enough. Even more so in cooler seasons, wreathed in mountain or sea mists. Just over a century ago, Kayaköy, or Levissi as it was known, was a bustling town of at least 10,000 Greek Orthodox Christians, many of whom were craftspeople who lived peacefully alongside the region’s Muslim Turkish farmers. But in the upheaval surrounding Turkey’s emergence as an independent republic, their simple lives were torn apart. Tensions with neighboring Greece after the Greco-Turk war ended in 1922 led to both countries ejecting people with ties to the other. For Kayaköy, that meant a forced population exchange with Muslim Turks living in Kavala, in what is now the Greek region of Macedonia and Thrace. But the newly arrived Muslims were reputedly less than happy with their new home, swiftly moving on and leaving Kayaköy to fall to ruin. Among the very few who did remain were the grandparents of Aysun Ekiz, whose family today runs a small restaurant near the main entrance to Kayaköy, which serves refreshments to tourists who come to look around the town. Stories of those difficult years have been passed down through the generations. “The Greek people were crying out because they did not want to leave, my grandparents told me,” Ekiz, who now sells handmade jewelry to visitors, says. “Some even left their kids behind to be looked after by Turkish friends because they thought they would return. But they never did.” Ekiz says her grandparents’ family were shepherds and easily adapted to life on the edge of town. Most of their fellow transplants, she says, disliked living in Kayaköy because walls of the houses were painted blue, supposedly to ward off scorpions or snakes. Snatches of that blue color can still be seen on the surviving walls of the 2,500 or so houses that make up Kayaköy, although few other decorative touches remain after decades left to the elements. What’s left is still worth exploring as a snapshot of an ancient way of life on the brink of the modern age. Jane Akatay, the co-author of “A Guide to Kayaköy,” says one reason for the abandonment of the town was perhaps the palpable sadness that lingers over the place following the tragic events of the 1920s. Nature has also played its part in the demise of its man-made features. “There have been earthquakes, there have been storms. The climate, the weather, the rainstorms… everything has impacted on this interesting place,” she says. “And also, over the years, the mortar holding them together has crumbled, and things fall apart if you don’t take care of them.” Today’s visitors pay a three-euro fee (just over $3) at a small kiosk on the main road before entering Kayaköy. From there, they can wander on foot up and down its sometimes steep and uneven lanes and alleyways. Signs at the entrance point to the school, the churches and the water fountain. It’s worth budgeting a couple of hours to take it all in. With few visitors aside from occasional tour groups during peak periods, it’s easy to find alone time here, imagining how it once bustled with life, not least in the old town square, where local men would once gather to drink tea and swap stories. Most of the houses, which were built in the century before abandonment, have now lost their roofs and their collapsed walls sprout with vegetation. Some houses have pits in their basement, once used for tanning hides for leather – shoemaking was a common profession here. Many still have intact cisterns – crucial for storing water in a town without plumbing. “Drinking water was carried in on donkeys,” says Ekiz. She also grimly recalls how, lacking proper sanitation, residents would use cut up old clothes instead of toilet paper. These rags were then burned as fuel or scattered on gardens as fertilizer. Despite the frugality of such measures, Ekiz says Kayaköy was relatively prosperous and was once the area’s main commercial hub, surpassing the nearby port of Fethiye – which is now a thriving urban center and popular tourist destination. Although this was clearly a close-knit community, Ekiz insists each of the two-story properties here was carefully spaced from its neighbor. “All of them were built so that no one had their sunlight blocked out by another,” she says. One of the most prominent buildings in the town is the Upper Church, a large structure of faded pink stucco walls and barrel-vaulted ceilings. Unfortunately, the building is sealed off due to its dilapidated state, although tantalizing glimpses of it can be enjoyed from many angles. On the highest inland point of the town, the ruins of Kayaköy’s old schoolhouse offer views over the main church and the houses below. Today, a Turkish flag flaps on a pole above the building. Surveying the scene here, Yiğit Ulaş Öztimur, on vacation from Turkish capital Ankara, describes Kayaköy as “a dark mirror of our past.” “This was once a Christian village, now what we see is a bitter reflection of what happened,” he says. “And because most of the buildings are intact, you can feel what life was like here.” There are marked hiking trails that pass through Kayaköy from nearby towns, but it’s easy to get lost wandering the streets. Some alleyways turn into dead ends. Open doorways and stairways beckon everywhere (although due to the dilapidated condition of many of the buildings, visitors are asked to refrain from entering). Across the valley, through the winding streets, the climb to the smaller church is worth doing. It’s a steep scramble up through rocks and pine trees over the last few meters, then it opens up to the hill’s summit. Reflecting the culture of those who lived here, the church resembles the classic small structures often found overlooking villages on Greek islands. It’s a tiny, modest building with a domed roof and little unglazed windows. The interior is completely empty. Another Turkish flag flies here, bright red against the deep blue sky. And below, across a thickly forested hillside, are the glistening waters of the Aegean Sea. It’s a spectacular view - and one that will have changed little since the days when Kayaköy was alive with people.

Cocooned in the warm embrace of the hamam, sounds are muffled. Gentle light from “eyes” in a large dome overhead, etches patterns across the marble surfaces below. Running water and softly dripping taps lap at the edges of consciousness like a lullaby. In the steamy, almost mystical atmosphere of a Turkish bath, the world stands still. Going to a hamam is very different from being in your bathroom at home, or even in a private room at a day spa when it’s just you and your therapist. “In a bath or shower you are alone but a hamam is a public space,” says Ahmet İğdirligil, architect and expert on the culture and history of Turkish baths. “It is a social place and a unique place in history for women to be social outside of their houses without needing permission.” In the past, women from wealthy families attended the hamam regularly. Some even had a hamam in their own home. Each woman used personalized items such as a hamam — a bowl with embossed motifs, sometimes even set with jewels — to pour water over her body. They also used satin cloth embroidered with silk or linen edged with lace, and , or towels. Traditionally made from pure cotton, the best ones have a hand-finished edge, a selvedge rather than a hem to stop them unravelling. Numerous sophisticated rules pertaining to cleanliness for every occasion — “after sex, menstruation, or having a baby,” Iğdirligil continues — from prayer through to marriage and childbirth, have been established and refined over the centuries. Even now, women in small towns still go to the hamam to escape their housewifely roles or look for brides for their sons. İğdirligil explains that each hamam has at least three sections, carefully designed to enhance the experience. First is the entrance area, traditionally heated by a , a Turkish wood burner, or a fire. This space contains changing rooms and a lounge section for resting after your bath. A small door opens into a semi-warm room with toilets, depilatory services and , marble basins. The main and largest section has a , a raised marble platform at its center, with more along the walls. Some hamams have smaller rooms called , hot rooms, off to the side of the or even a in each corner. “The structure is very important because it is a journey into the hamam and back,” Iğdirligil says. “The second two rooms always have a dome and the height of the room is always more than the width. The openings in the dome add to the atmosphere and increase the sense of space. They seem like stars in the sky and it is like looking at the cosmos.” This is particularly true of . Built in 1741 to raise revenue to fund Sultan Mahmut’s library, it has a bright white marble interior. The overall effect is one of floating on a cloud. With the “heat, humidity, and the sound, murmurs like a heartbeat, you feel like you are in the womb,” says Iğdirligil. Elif Kartal, guest relations and operations manager of , has worked in Turkish baths for almost 20 years. She says that while most hamams offer a similar set of services such as , a body scrub that uses a special glove, and , a Turkish foam massage, “there are differences in the functioning of these baths between each other, sometimes according to preference and sometimes according to their structural condition.” Of the 237 hamams in Istanbul, only 60 remain in operation. In general, most smaller hamams have only one set of facilities meaning men and women bathe separately at different times, and sometimes on different days. Larger, historic hamams like Zeyrek Çinili Hamam and the lavish have separate bathing areas for men and women. The latter, designed for Roxelana, the wife of Süleyman the Magnificent, in 1556 by Mimar Sinan, chief architect of the Ottoman court, was the first hamam to have a women’s section that exactly mirrored the men’s side. Many Istanbul hamams are open until as late as 11 p.m. but you should plan and book in advance. Elif Tamtartar, a — a female bathing attendant — at Zeyrek Çinili Hamam with 25 years’ experience, says customers need to avoid a few things prior to their session. “Do not wax immediately before the bath and avoid using body lotions and oil-based products the day before because it reduces the effectiveness and efficiency of the because it causes the glove to slide on the skin,” she says. She also suggests eating lightly before your visit and avoiding alcohol, as you may feel uncomfortable in the heat. All hamams have changing areas where you can leave clothes and lock away valuables. Some will ask you to disclose basic health details. They usually provide disposable underwear, but you can wear your own or swimwear. The reaches all parts of your body so wearing a one-piece isn’t recommended — and be prepared to have your underwear hauled up high and rolled down low. Being washed by someone else is the ultimate in luxury. It takes you back to childhood bathtime memories, of being warm and drowsy and cared for. Once you’re changed and wrapped in a , your awaits — or for men, your . At Zeyrek Çinili Hamam they take your hand and carefully lead you through the middle room to the heart of the bath house. There, you’re gently rinsed with warm water then invited to lie down on a towel atop the . The heat from the marble combined with the steamily pleasant air is extremely relaxing and, when the allotted 15 minutes of sweating is over, they may even have to wake you. Using a small bowl, your attendant cascades water over your hair, face and body, washing away the sweat. Despite the name, there are no actual baths in Turkish hamam. “Before Islam,” İğdirligil explains, “Turks had Shamanic beliefs and believed water was holy. To wash yourself in water means to make the water dirty. In Turkish Islam, if the water touches your body, the water and therefore your body are no longer clean.” After the rinse comes the . Although the words and are used to describe bathing attendants, “among ourselves,” Tamtartar says, “we call those who do this job , regardless of gender”. Tamtartar learned the art of body scrubbing, from her family. “My mother and grandmother always worked in this profession,” she says. “I didn’t learn in any school or course but rather from them. I actually learned before I was 15 years old”. A looks and feels similar to coarse sandpaper in fabric form and is used to scrub dead skin from the body. In the past a , a pumice stone, was used instead. High-ranking women had theirs encased in handcrafted silver cups and embossed with personalized designs. The sensation of having your skin scrubbed with a glove can be distinctly odd — at times rough, sometimes ticklish even strangely hot. Almost no inch of skin is left untouched. A good covers the torso, arms and legs as well as face, inner thighs and all the way down to the sacral dimples. If you find the pressure too much or have sensitive areas, let your know. Although, “most of us do not know foreign languages ​​in general”, Tamtartar says, “we have been doing this job for years, we can easily communicate with foreign guests through body language.” As your scrubs, layers of thin black grit — hidden city grime — roll off the skin. or loofah, are then used to remove the dead cells. It varies from hamam to hamam, but the lif can be made from cotton, linen or goat hair. Once you’re squeaky clean it’s time for a Turkish The creates foam by soaping up a piece of soft wet muslin and ballooning it out before passing it gently across your body in preparation for the massage. Most Turkish soap is made from olive oil because it cleans without stripping away the skin’s natural oils. This, combined with the effects of the makes your skin feel brand new, with a cashmere-like softness. Tamtartar says kese prevents aging. “Pores open in the bath and cell renewal accelerates since the scrub also serves as a peeling,” she says. Once the final hair-washing stage is over, you leave the way you came, first stopping in the middle section to be patted dry and swaddled in towels before re-entering the cool room, the space you first entered. It’s not recommended to leave a hamam abruptly, so lie back, enjoy your tea and, when you’re ready, glide back to the changing area to get dressed. Taking time out and being soothed by the balm of steamy waters are timeless pleasures that never grow old. Yet going to the hamam has never solely been about getting clean. “Guests who come to the bath forget their troubles and sorrows,” says Tamtartar. “We approach them with a mother’s love. To us, they are our children. The energy of water, the bath and the person unites. And when your energy is one with the guest you wash, even if we provide a very long service, time flows like water — the main source of healing.”", "tags": ["bath", "turkish"]},

{"content": "Four hours and 58 minutes after it had begun, the longest winner-takes-all playoff game in history was decided in suitably dramatic fashion on Friday night. With the bases loaded, one out and a full count, Jorge Polanco – who was 0-for-5 up until that point – sent the 472nd pitch of the night into right field, and sent the to their first (ALCS) in 24 years with a 3-2 win over the Detroit Tigers. “A lot of emotions since the start of the game,” Polanco reflected afterward. “I know we played a long game, but this team never gives up. I know there is a lot of emotion but we always try and keep it simple and just try and go out there and play.” Polanco’s single may be the moment that fans will still be talking about in 20 years, but Seattle’s victory in Game 5 of the American League Division Series (ALDS) was defined by an extraordinary night from its pitching staff. Starters Logan Gilbert and Luis Castillo both pitched in relief for the first time in their major league careers, while relievers Matt Brash and Eduard Bazardo made their longest ever appearances. There were also contributions from Gabe Speier and Andrés Muñoz, after George Kirby had given up one run in five innings to kick things off. “I don’t even know where to begin to try to recap all the heroic efforts that went into today. Just from one guy to the next,” Mariners manager Dan Wilson told reporters afterward. “Just an incredible ballgame from top to bottom.” For the Tigers, another wonderful showing from Tarik Skubal would come to mean nothing. The two-time All-Star gave up one run off two hits and no walks in six innings, striking out 13 – a record number of punchouts for a postseason winner-takes-all game. His dominance had Detroit 2-1 up after the sixth, in which Kerry Carpenter had hit a two-run homer off Speier. But Skubal’s subsequent exit would see the Mariners tie the game immediately thanks to one of the evening’s many unlikely heroes. Leo Rivas, a journeyman minor leaguer who only made his MLB debut last year, stepped up for the first postseason at-bat of his career on his 28th birthday. His single to left field brought home Polanco, and the game was tied again. “It’s hard,” Rivas said afterward of a career which had seen him wait the best part of a decade for his opportunity. “(Watching) everybody go all the way like that. Most people just give up. “It’s not easy. I was thinking to give up back then also.” Rivas’ RBI single took the game to extra innings, where missed opportunities for Seattle in the 10th, 12th and 13th had the crowd at T-Mobile Park fearing a potential repeat of 2022, when the Mariners were eliminated at this stage by the Houston Astros after 18 innings. J.P. Crawford went 1-for-7 that night, and so it was only fitting that it should be him who touched home off Polanco’s single on Friday to clinch the walk-off victory and begin the wild celebrations.

{"content": "Three of a kind! The Las Vegas Aces can now call themselves the WNBA’s latest dynasty. The Aces secured the 2025 WNBA championship following a 97-86 win over the Phoenix Mercury Friday to sweep the Finals. It is Las Vegas’ third title in four seasons and were led by no other than superstar . The 29-year-old Wilson finished with 31 points and nine rebounds to add another ring to her collection of accolades which include being named MVP for a record-breaking fourth time this season. It wasn’t the only history Wilson made. She was named Finals MVP for the second time in her career, and has now become the first player in WNBA history to win MVP, FMVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season. The win Game 4 and are the 2025 WNBA Champions 🚨 A'ja Wilson: 31 PTS | 9 REB | 4 AST | 3 BLKS | 2 STL Jackie Young: 18 PTS | 7 REB | 8 AST Chelsea Gray: 18 PTS | 4 REB | 4 AST | 2 STL | 2 BLKS WNBA Finals presented by An emotional Wilson shared an embrace with her partner, Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo, following the win. “For us to be able to celebrate this, it’s truly special,” Wilson told ESPN on making history. “We worked our butts off to get to this point. And now its time to have some fun. I wish I could take this credit but this is God’s work. This ain’t got nothing to do with me. This is not about X’s and O’s. This is from what’s inside.” Just like the story in Game 3 a few days ago, it wasn’t an easy road to victory for Las Vegas. Despite a 16-point deficit going into halftime, the Mercury have proven in these Finals that no one can ever count them out. Phoenix clawed their way back into the game in the third quarter, cutting the Aces lead to just 12 behind forward Kahleah Copper scoring 12 of her 30 points in the period. Late in the third, it all came to a crashing halt as Mercury head coach Nate Tibbetts was ejected after being issued a double technical for arguing a foul call on guard Monique Akoa Makani. The second-year coach appeared to be confused after the foul call before exiting the court and heading into the locker room tunnel. The ejection grew the ire of Copper. “I think the refs aren’t doing a good job tonight, I’m sorry,” Copper told ESPN during an in-game interview. “But we’ve just got to keep our heads.” The Mercury kept up their resilience throughout the fourth quarter, turning it into a six-point game at one point but Las Vegas proved to be too much. Copper would foul out of the game late in the fourth quarter just as the Aces appeared to have all but wrapped up the victory. As the buzzer sounded and Aces players and coaches rushed onto the Mortgage Matchup Center floor to celebrate the win, guard Chelsea Gray commended her team for getting through the adversity they faced all season. “This team has been through hell and back,” an emotional Gray told ESPN after the game before hugging head coach Becky Hammon. “What a run. Everyone stepped up. Everybody. We got the best player in the world in A’ja Wilson. … We’re champions bro.” The start of the 2025 season was a grueling one for the Aces, starting out 14-14 before winning their last 16 regular season games. As WNBA commissioner was booed loudly while addressing the Phoenix crowd, it was Aces and NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis who got to hoist the WNBA championship trophy first. The loss is a familiar feeling for Phoenix, who have now lost in the WNBA Finals for the second time in five years. Tibbetts didn’t mince words about his ejection and the refereeing. “To me, that’s embarrassing. I feel bad that I was tossed. Been around this game a long time. I think it’s one of the weakest double technicals ever,” Tibbetts told reporters after the game. “I didn’t even know I got the second one, to be completely honest. I don’t understand it.” Tibbetts added he wasn’t trying to get himself ejected. “We’re playing for our playoff lives. Most coaches when they get tossed, you’re doing it on purpose. That was not my intention at all,” he added. “There’s been issues with the officiating all year. I have to look at it. I feel like I didn’t deserve that.” When asked about her comments to ESPN during the game, Copper stopped short expanding on her feelings. “It’s cool. It’s done. We don’t even got to talk about that. It’s cool. It’s done,” Copper said. Phoenix has won three championships in their franchise history, the last coming in 2014. The team came into Friday’s win-or-go-home game shorthanded after forward Satou Sabally sustained a concussion late in Game 3 and suffered another blow when forward Alyssa Thomas appeared to injure her shoulder before halftime. She returned in the second half, but it was apparent the injury bothered her the rest of the way. Thomas told reporters her shoulder was “good” and was proud of the way her team responded all season. “I think this team just showed what we’re about. It’s a game I don’t think I ever been a part of like that, but super proud of how we fought, continued to play through everything. It’s been a great season. No one expected us to even be here,” Thomas said. “Of course it didn’t go the way that we want it to end, but we have a lot to build on.”", "tags": ["vegas", "sweep", "championship", "wnba", "phoenix", "las", "mercury", "win"]},
{"content": "As soon as he learned the was returning to China, diehard fan Buke Liu scrambled to get his hands on tickets, paying almost a thousand dollars – a price you might expect for an NBA game – for a ticket to a preseason match-up. One of America’s most successful sporting exports, the NBA is hugely popular in China, and a rare cultural touchpoint between two nations increasingly seen as geopolitical rivals. For Liu, and many Chinese fans, it’s been a long wait to go to a game. NBA teams, packed with global stars, have effectively been banned from setting foot in one of basketball’s largest overseas markets since 2019, following a that drew the ire of Beijing. And the pent-up demand has made seats at this weekend’s Phoenix Suns - Brooklyn Nets preseason matches particularly hard to come by. The Suns beat the Nets 132-127 after overtime in the first game on Friday at The Venetian Hotel in Macao, the glitzy gambling hub in southern China known for its casino-powered entertainment. The second contest is slated for Sunday at the end of a three-day basketball carnival that also allows fans to try out their hoop skills at game booths, as well as meeting some of the league’s iconic former players, from Shaquille O’Neal and Yao Ming to Vince Carter and Jeremy Lin. Liu forked out $980 to a scalper for his seat at the Sunday game and access to fan activities. Tickets to see the same teams face each other in Phoenix for the Suns’ home game in January are on sale for as little as $15, but the university student has no regrets about paying top dollar for his tickets. “It’s worth it. They are playing in China,” the Suns fan told CNN. “I am very happy about the return of the NBA China games because it allows (Chinese) fans … to watch the games in person.” The return, after a six-year absence, packs more than just fanfare: it bears symbolic significance. In 2019, a from then Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of Hong Kong protesters angered Beijing, culminating in televised games being pulled and sponsors in China severing ties with the league. While NBA games have gradually returned to state-owned television and commercial activities have slowly trickled back over the years, Chinese fans being able to see players in person once again marks the culmination of the comeback. Ticketing revenue, merchandise sales and sponsorship opportunities, backed by a massive fanbase which spends big without batting an eyelid, are what the NBA stands to gain from its return to the country, where basketball is booming among its population of 1.4 billion, experts and insiders tell CNN. But greater opportunities also come with greater risks, Paul Argenti, professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, told CNN, cautioning that the NBA will now have to tread carefully to avoid the tiniest misstep. “It’s a thaw, but it’s also a test of how far the NBA and Chinese authorities are willing to rebuild ties,” he said. Tapping into the vastly lucrative Chinese market and playing by Beijing’s rules can be a perilous tightrope for international brands, like the NBA – especially when it comes to issues that clash with their corporate values. “One misstep by a player or a coach, (an) offhand remark like the one Daryl (Morey) made, could reignite those tensions,” said Argenti. Geopolitics, though, were the last thing on the minds of Liu and other fans that headed to the NBA spectacle on Friday – they’re just happy to see elite basketball back, even a preseason contest, back on the court in China. Devin Booker appeared to steal the show as many fans turned up in his jersey cheering for the Suns star guard whenever he hit a jumper. Among them were father Arkers Wong and his 12-year-old son Altus, who brought along a tiny basketball autographed by Booker during a previous trip to Phoenix to watch the four-time NBA All-Star. “We were so excited…Almost all the players had their time on the court,” said Wong, who spent about $6,400 for the three-day experience, that includes stays at hotels. “We were sitting next to the players’ entrance [to the court] so some of them signed the jerseys we brought,” he added. Student Joseph Hu, also a Booker fan, is already planning ahead. “Of course, I will see them again if they come back to play next year,” he told CNN. Home fans also showered Zeng Fanbo with thunderous applause when the Chinese forward made his debut with the Nets during Friday’s preseason game. Zeng has signed a one-year Exhibit 10 – a one-year, minimum salary agreement that isn’t guaranteed – contract with Brooklyn. The Chinese market has plenty to offer, especially at a time when the league is exploring opportunities beyond the fanbase back home. The NBA’s TV ratings in the US have declined slightly over recent years – though, according to the league, Game 7 of the 2025 Finals series recorded the biggest TV audience for a single Finals game in six years. David Carter, adjunct professor at USC Marshall School of Business, told CNN that the global market can be “vital” for growing revenue. “Any concentrated focus on China, one that is successfully positioned and rolled out, should enable the NBA to drive this revenue and franchise value growth,” he said. The NBA’s popularity in China exploded after Yao Ming was drafted by the Houston Rockets as the No. 1 pick in 2002. Before the 2019 fallout, nearly 500 million people, more than a third of China’s population, were tuning in to watch the league’s content, according to an estimate by Chinese social media giant Tencent, which currently holds the league’s digital broadcasting rights. In 2019, NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum an estimated 300 million people in China played the sport. That number has likely climbed since then, with viral videos on Chinese social media showing how the love for the sport has spread to rural areas, sparking huge rivalries in village tournaments. The game has also inspired the popular reality show Dunk of China, which featured former NBA players Jeremy Lin and Stephon Marbury coaching skilled amateur players. The value of NBA China, the arm of the league that manages all its operations in the Greater China region, is estimated at approximately $5 billion, according to an analysis commissioned by ESPN in 2022. “China is the NBA’s most important market outside of the United States, with hundreds of millions of fans, huge media rights sponsorship potential,” said Dartmouth professor Argenti. “Walking away is never going to be a long-term option.” Some of the biggest names in the NBA have already taken steps before the league to reconnect with their Chinese fans in person. LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Nikola Jokić toured China to promote sneakers earlier this year. NBA players are also popping up on a range of Chinese social media platforms – from the X-like Weibo to Douyin, China’s version of TikTok – to share snippets of their lives and maximize their exposure to Chinese fans. Matthew Spalter, chief operating officer at East Goes Global, an agency that specializes in helping localize social media content for a Chinese audience, said his company has been helping at least 10 NBA players and one third of all teams to formulate marketing strategies to break into the Chinese market. “We’ve never seen the demand higher than we’ve seen since really diving into sports,” Spalter said. “It’s like an open pool of opportunity.” Former Phoenix Suns forward Shawn Marion, who was invited to Macau to meet fans, told CNN that his visit reminded him how much the nation loves the NBA. “I just love coming here,” he said. Before the relationship turned sour, the NBA was warmly welcomed in China, where it regularly staged games. But it took just one comment to jeopardize the seemingly friendly dynamic. Andrew Spalter, CEO at East Goes Global, says his company prepares clients for sensitive questions that come their way. “We simply ask them high-level questions,” he said, adding that they would advise clients not to talk about things they would normally avoid in public. But the reality is more nuanced. Argenti said the NBA’s comeback is a masterclass in how to navigate the Chinese market amid intensifying geopolitical tensions. But he warns that things could get more complicated again in President Donald Trump’s second term. “They’ve (got) trouble at home and trouble abroad because, if they get it wrong, Trump will amplify it, make it worse than it already is,” said Argenti. “That makes it even more of a tightrope.” CNN’s John Liu contributed to this report.", "tags": ["splash", "foul", "china", "stay", "trouble", "nba", "return"]},

{"content": "The crash of a small plane in southwestern Brazil killed four people including Chinese landscape architect and urban planner , Brazilian authorities said Wednesday. The accident happened late Tuesday during a landing attempt at a large farm about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the municipality of Aquidauana in Mato Grosso do Sul state, firefighters said. Yu, who was known for promoting ecologically sound development, was traveling with two Brazilian documentary makers, Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were making a film about the Pantanal wetlands. All three were killed along with pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, authorities said. Yu was know for developing the concept of “ ,” with infrastructure that can absorb rainwater to mitigate flood risks and improve the urban climate. “In times of climate change,” Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on social media, “Yu became a global reference with his sponge cities, which unite quality of life and environmental protection.” Yu argued that by creating large spaces to hold water in city centers, such as parks and ponds, extreme rainfall can be absorbed, helping prevent floods. The idea is widely cited in Chinese urban planning, and in recent years Yu worked on projects in other countries including Saudi Arabia and Thailand. He was known for his “notable contributions to sustainable urbanism, the preservation of biodiversity, and the protection of the planet,” Brazil’s Vice President Geraldo Alckmin adding that Yu’s legacy will continue to inspire those dedicated to ecological cause. Yu founded the College of Architecture and Landscape at Peking University, one of China’s most prestigious universities. The university did not respond a request for comment. The military fire department in Aquidauana was called at around 8:10 p.m. local time on Tuesday to respond to a plane crash, firefighters said. A search and rescue operation lasted approximately nine hours. Yu and the filmmakers were part of a team producing a documentary about the world’s largest tropical wetlands. The Pantanal, fed by tributaries of the Paraguay River and mostly located in Brazil, is a biodiversity hotspot and a popular destination for tourists to see jaguars, macaws, caimans, capybaras and migratory birds in the wild. In an interview with The Associated Press in 2022, Yu criticized much of Asia’s modern infrastructure for being built on ideas imported from Europe, which he said are ill-fitted to the monsoon climate that prevails over much of the continent.", "tags": ["plane", "crash", "architect", "city", "yu", "sponge", "brazil", "kongjian"]},

{"content": "Every year, in the middle of summer, hundreds of Hong Kong construction workers and engineers walk up some 200 steps to Ching Lin Terrace in the seaside neighborhood of Kennedy Town. There, in one of the city’s temples they gather and pay their respects to Lo Pan, a legendary Chinese carpenter from the Zhou dynasty and patron saint of builders and contractors. Even in the sweltering heat, workers cram into the tiny temple’s smoke-filled foyer with incense and candlesticks in hand. Bowing several times, they chant slogans in honor of the construction deity’s birthday and pray for a stable year of work. “I always tell people that Lo Pan is like our Michelangelo. He is a designer, an architect and an engineer,” said Lawrence Ng, president of the Hong Kong Construction Sub-Contractors Association, which represents the city’s waterproofing, metalwork and scaffolding professionals, among others. “We must pay respects to the workers who came before us, and Lo Pan is our ‘sifu’ (master).” Worshipping Lo Pan has taken on a particular significance in today’s precarious economy, Ng said. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the city has seen in large scale construction projects, leaving many laborers employment. Among them are the city’s — thousands of construction workers trained in the ancient technique of bamboo scaffolding. On a slope behind Lo Pan temple is a towering residential building covered in a familiar sight to those who’ve walked Hong Kong’s streets: bamboo poles arranged in a distinct grid-like formation. The crisscrossed structures, in which each pole is fastened with nylon ties, are ubiquitous across the city’s dense, vertical urban landscape. These scaffolds are erected on skyscrapers, hundreds of feet high, and encased in fabric safety nets forming colorful cocoons of green, blue and purple. Smaller bamboo contraptions often poke out of windows, or cover air conditioning units and balconies. Bamboo scaffolding is not only used in the construction of new buildings, but the renovation of thousands of high-rises and historic tenements (“tong lau”) every year. Popular in Hong Kong for over a century, the technique’s origins in Chinese construction date back to at least the Han dynasty, around 2,000 years ago. The method was also widely used in mainland China until government regulations started calling for steel and aluminum scaffolds, in keeping with international norms, in the 1990s. Bamboo, however, remained the go-to material in Hong Kong, and has been used to build some of the city’s tallest skyscrapers, like Norman Foster’s HSBC headquarters and parts of the 88-floor International Finance Centre. Aside from helping develop Hong Kong’s modern structures, bamboo has also played an integral role in building temporary Cantonese opera . These traditional theaters, made entirely out of the plant, are built on special occasions like the birthdays of local deities or the Hungry Ghost Festival. Scaffolding has, in turn, become part of the city’s visual language. Being lightweight, customizable and relatively affordable, bamboo stands in stark contrast to its mainstream counterpart, metal. “Steel is relatively stiff and strong, but it’s less flexible than bamboo,” said Goman Ho, a structural engineer at British engineering firm Arup, who has more than three decades of experience overseeing the development of tall buildings in the city, including the 283-meter (928-foot) tall Cheung Kong Center. “Bamboo on the other hand, has its own craftsmanship,” he added. “You can build a lot of beautiful scaffolding in ways you’d never think of.” Whether in traditional or modern construction, handling the long poles requires specific skills and intuition, which can take months or years to achieve. “Sometimes people spend one, two, three or even four years learning bamboo scaffolding and may not become masters,” said Ho Ping-Tak (no relation), Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union. “But with metal, the technical requirements are lower. If you have the strength, you can generally meet the requirements in a much shorter time.” The largest member of the grass family, bamboo is combustible, susceptible to deterioration and weaker in rain, raising legitimate questions about its durability, Arup’s Ho said. “We need to find ways to overcome it,” he said of these challenges, suggesting that poles could be coated with epoxy or plastic solution to prevent erosion. “It’s culture we need to maintain,” Ho added. But keeping the tradition alive is challenging. The industry comprises an aging workforce –– many, like 78-year-old Leung Siu Wai, among the dozens of senior bamboo scaffold workers paying respects to Lo Pan, are close to retirement. New talent is also lacking, said Ng. “It’s hard to get young people to enter,” he added. “Young people in Hong Kong don’t want to do physically demanding work, or work that gives them an identity they feel uncomfortable with.” Discussions on safeguarding the practice resurfaced earlier this year when the Hong Kong government’s Development Bureau that 50% of new public building projects erected from March onwards would need to use metal scaffolding to “better protect workers” and align with modern construction standards in “advanced cities.” The notice sparked concern among some Hong Kong residents, even though the policy will only impact “one or two new building projects” this year, according to the statement. The bureau later confirmed to CNN that only one public project would be affected in 2025. Nonetheless, some residents have taken to social media to lament what they believed to be the beginning of the end of bamboo scaffolding. “This is your sign to film bamboo scaffolding while you still can,” wrote a Hong Kong videographer in an Instagram that garnered over 20,000 likes. “Truly one of Hong Kong’s quiet wonders. And soon, it’ll just be part of the past.” The storied building technique has also been celebrated on the global stage, presented as part of the Hong Kong pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale –– the world’s largest architecture exhibition. In May, a sprawling bamboo scaffold was built in the courtyard of Venice’s Campo della Tana, as part of a showcase exploring the diverse and often juxtaposing aspects of public space in Hong Kong, with a focus on threatened heritage. Its curators said their proposal for the pavilion was finalized in January, two months before the government announced its move to adopt more metal scaffolding in construction. “We were a bit shocked, to say the least, because we had planned for this without knowing (the government’s announcement) was coming,” said Ying Zhou, an architect and one of the curators. “So immediately, we were like, ‘Oh what does our thing now say?’ It takes on a whole different kind of importance, especially when we bring it to a place like Venice.” Eleven bamboo “sifus,” or masters, traveled to Venice to build the structure. Watching them in action, Zhou’s Italian counterparts were, she said, impressed with the way the material was assembled so quickly and precisely –– without much calculation. “These pre-modern technologies are never recognized in a standardized world, because you have steel, you have concrete, you have numbers that are calculable,” she said. “And here we have something that even the Italians are like, ‘Oh, we need your structural engineer to certify (it).’” Thirty-six-year-old Over Chan, a bamboo scaffold worker who builds structures for external repair work, claims that recent industry-wide discussions about fatal accidents on construction sites have prompted more government intervention. (There were from January 2018 to August 2025, according to Hong Kong’s Labour Department). “When I was starting out as a worker, we didn’t even have to wear shirts, but now, we’re required to wear our uniform, have good manners, and so on –– this ultimately allows us to rise above the competition.” “Bamboo is not unsafe,” Ho, the chairman of the workers’ union, said, emphasizing the importance of workers fastening themselves to the wooden structures. “It’s fine to use metal scaffolding –– we’re not saying that metal scaffolding is a competing technique, but if (the government) makes an announcement without much explanation…it gives the public the wrong impression that bamboo is unsafe, which has huge implications.” Hong Kong’s Development Bureau told CNN that adopting metal scaffolding in construction is just one of many ways to improve site safety. “Provided relevant legislative requirements on bamboo scaffolds and metal scaffolds are fulfilled, both types of scaffolds are safe,” the bureau said in an email, adding that the government has “no intention to phase out the adoption of bamboo scaffolds.” Many large-scale construction projects in Hong Kong already incorporate a hybrid of bamboo and steel scaffolding, the union leader Ho said, with metal bars fixed to the ground supporting wooden structures higher up. He estimates that, currently, 80% of scaffolds are created using bamboo, while 20% use metal or a hybrid of materials. Chan, who remains eager and optimistic about the trade, said he has started taking courses on metal scaffolding to stand out in the workforce, despite his belief that bamboo isn’t going anywhere. “Over the past few years, there’s been this feeling in Hong Kong about needing to preserve what’s left of the city’s identity,” he said.

{"content": "Zooey Deschanel’s new home is overflowing with bespoke design flourishes. The actor’s upholstered L-shaped sofa was custom-made, as was the marble mantelpiece. Her bed, kitchen hood, terrace trellises and various lampshades are all custom, too. Perhaps that’s just what happens when you buy a home with a man famed for transforming fixer-uppers as one half of the Canadian TV show “Property Brothers.” Deschanel’s fiancé Jonathan Scott is, along with his twin brother Drew, the face of interior design and home renovation on cable’s HGTV. The presenter also co-owns a magazine, production company, furnishing lines, how-to book series and YouTube channel all dedicated to one thing: helping people build their dream homes. Now it was his turn. “He won’t stop until everything is perfect,” Deschanel told Architectural Digest as the pair opened the doors of their Manhattan duplex for the magazine’s forthcoming . “And anything I can think of, he can execute.” The result is a meticulously curated home that balances old-world charm with the kind of quaint touches one might expect from a star renowned for twee vintage fashion and quirky roles in “500 Days of Summer,” “Elf” and the long-running sitcom “New Girl.” “The first thing they told me was, ‘Nothing modern. We want a sense of history and we love color,’” said the couple’s interiors collaborator Young Huh, a New York-based designer who also spoke to Architectural Digest for the feature. Allusions to history are found across the Georgian-inspired property, from decorative pilasters to the crown molding that lines its palatially high ceilings. There’s literal heritage, too, in the form of antique chairs dating back to the reign of Britain’s George III (and now upholstered in deep purple velvet). The apartment building itself is slightly newer, dating to the turn of the 20th century. Deschanel and Scott, who met while filming a “Carpool Karaoke” segment for “The Late Late Show with James Corden” in 2019, recalled the duplex being in a sorry state when they first viewed it that year. “It was totally raw and stripped down, like an abandoned 1980s office building,” said Scott. “It was definitely sketch,” Deschanel added. Almost six years later, the home is completely transformed. Floral and botanical patterns are a recurring theme, from the chintz sofas to the colorful hollyhock wallpaper that greets visitors at a private elevator entrance. Above the hardwood dining room, a bouquet of Murano glass roses spills out from a whimsical Bottega Veneziana chandelier. These florals rub up against embroidered wall coverings, striped curtains and flashes of marble. It seems no surface was left untouched by their interior designer. “Young is brilliant with maximalist style and she really got my aesthetic,” Deschanel told Architectural Digest, which last month published a coffee table book “ ” featuring almost 70 celebrity homes. “It takes a lot of skill to mix patterns and textures and make them feel harmonious.” Elsewhere, in a pistachio-colored family room, two recessed bookshelves flank a large fireplace. Three separate terraces meanwhile offer sunlit outdoor spaces. There’s also a kids’ room equipped with bunk beds for Deschanel’s two children, 10-year-old Elsie and 8-year-old Charlie, from her former marriage to Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard. For now, however, the Manhattan apartment will only serve as the family’s East Coast pied-à-terre, not their main residence. Deschanel hails from Los Angeles (earlier this year, her childhood home was in Pacific Palisades was destroyed by the wildfires that devastated the city), where she and Scott bought — and, of course, renovated — a huge in the leafy Brentwood neighborhood.", "tags": ["scott", "step", "fiancé", "manhattan", "jonathan", "home", "deschanel"]},
{"content": "Sitting inside the minimalist-chic interior of Nestle, you’d never guess it used to be a wind turbine. From the outside, though, the tiny home’s former life is more apparent. Nestle has a caravan-like aesthetic: a cream-colored, elongated metal box topped with four solar panels and a single skylight. Inside, glass doors and windows at each end create a surprisingly light and airy space in the compact (376-square-foot) pod. Nestle — a loose homonym of “nacelle,” the part of a wind turbine containing its engine — is made from a decommissioned, donated by Business of Wind, a Dutch company that purchases used turbines for reuse. Marking the first time a nacelle has ever been used for housing, the Dutch building code-compliant home is an ambitious demonstration of the possibilities of upcycling, says Jos de Krieger, co-founder of , the company behind the project. “This is basically the most complex thing that you can do with it,” said Krieger on a video call, who is also a partner at Dutch architecture firm Superuse Studios, one of the home’s designers. “So, all the other less complex things are now easier to imagine and to realize, because this has already been done.” Amid a global boom in onshore and offshore wind farming, turbine waste is expected to accelerate in the coming decades. Krieger hopes that projects like Nestle can provide an end-of-life alternative for decommissioned blades and nacelles. “Everything in the built environment — everything that you see around you — has an end of life,” said Krieger. “And we need solutions besides waste or landfill, incineration or something without value.” “Changing that perception is really something that has to happen in the eyes of everyone,” he said, calling for “processes that create stories, instead of waste.” While Nestle is Krieger’s most ambitious upcycling project to date, it’s not his first time working with turbine waste. In 2008, one of his first projects as a then-intern at Superuse, involved transforming five decommissioned turbine blades into a children’s . “The main challenge, in most cases, is that it has never been done before,” he explained. “So it’s innovation at its core, where you try to do something that nobody knows if it’s possible and what it takes to make it possible.” Superuse, which dedicates its practice to sustainable and circular design, went on to pioneer more turbine-upcycling projects over the next 15 years. The firm launched Blade-Made in 2021 as an initiative to take its design concepts to market. Two years later, Krieger turned it into a separate company with Rotterdam-based design firm . Krieger describes Blade-Made as a “mediator” between the wind industry and the field of design. And Nestle, which debuted at the , epitomizes this collaborative cross-sector approach. Commissioned by Swedish power company Vattenfall, the project involved the work of , including structural support by IMd Consulting Engineers, interior design by Woodwave and Reliving, technical installations by Feenstra and design by Superuse. Blade-Made has also transformed decommissioned turbine blades into a range of other structures, from benches to bus stops to street sculptures. The size and weight of blades and nacelles make them difficult to transport and work with, “so we need simple ways to adapt and change it into something usable,” said Krieger. Wind turbines are increasingly vital to renewable energy infrastructure, with global wind power operating capacity reaching around in 2025 (for context, 1 gigawatt is enough to power ). Last year, they accounted for production, a share that’s expected to grow to , according to the International Energy Agency. But as more wind power is installed, a new challenge is emerging: What to do with turbines after their 20- or 25-year operational lifespan? While of each turbine’s mass, excluding its foundations, can be recycled, blades and nacelles typically cannot, due to their complex structures and high fiberglass . “Unfortunately, blade recycling is technically challenging,” said , a development engineer at the Technical University of Denmark’s (DTU) Department of Wind and Energy Systems, in a video interview. “The nature of the material is difficult to process, and the component is actually just one piece. It’s not something that you can re-manufacture, like you would do with a washing machine, where you can take things apart.” A lack of open-source data on blade composition further complicates recycling and upcycling efforts, she added. The scale of the problem is growing. In the US alone, wind blade waste could reach over , according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and another that by 2033, around 200,000 tons of wind turbine blade waste will need to be disposed of globally each year. But DTU’s Beauson notes that projections on waste volumes are often speculative, as there’s limited data on whether decommissioned turbines are disposed of, recycled or put back into service in other countries. “The forecast of waste is almost impossible to make,” she added. Many countries in Europe have now banned turbine parts from landfills, adding urgency to the search for waste solutions. Last year, the US Department of Energy invested for researchers developing cost-effective recycling technologies for wind energy systems. And in 2021, renewable energy giant Siemens Gamesa developed the “ ” recyclable wind turbine blades, that allows the materials to be separated at the end of their life, which were recently at one of the UK’s largest offshore windfarms. Currently, Beauson doesn’t believe there is enough blade waste to sustain large-scale recycling operations. But this could be where repurposing solutions, like Blade-Made, prove valuable, as they require less specialized equipment than mechanical or thermal recycling, making them more accessible. “You don’t need rocket science technology; you need to understand the material, you need knowledge about the structure of the blade, and you need to understand what you can and cannot do,” Beauson said. The wind power industry is also beginning to explore “material passports,” which track all the materials used in a product through its lifecycle, to improve transparency and aid recyclers, said Beauson. But while this could bolster upcycling, turbine manufacturers can be surprisingly reluctant to share detailed blade designs, even for outdated models, she added. Krieger said that insufficient transparency is one of the biggest challenges his team faces. He likens the upcycling process to remodeling an old house: “You break open a wall and you find something that you did not expect.” He called on manufacturers to publish more information on material composition, design sketches and strength testing records, particularly for models that are no longer made: “If that becomes more open source…that would help with repurposing solutions.” Blade-Made’s latest project converts turbine blades into sound barriers used at the sides of highways. The 37-meter-long (121 feet), 5,600-kilogram (6.1 ton) blades can be used in their entirety, without needing to be cut into pieces, a process that requires a lot of energy. According to Krieger, standard concrete sound barriers need steel or concrete foundations every 6 to 10 meters (19.7 to 32.8 feet), whereas the Blade Barrier uses a support structure every 25 meters (82 feet), which reduces carbon emissions and material use. A prototype is currently being tested on a roadside in North-Brabant in the Netherlands. Blade-Made’s projects have predominantly been completed in the Netherlands, but Krieger is eager to collaborate with clients and designers in other countries. He hopes to adapt his concepts to different geographies and regulatory requirements. So far, the response to Nestle has been “overwhelming,” said Krieger, and the company is now in “early-stage preparations” to create its first run of around 10 micro homes, which will help “optimize production and make it fit-to-market.” As more potential uses for the wind turbine parts are showcased, “the easier it will be to convince people, clients and wind farm owners that it is also an option for them,” he added.", "tags": ["homes", "tough", "micro", "turbines", "recycle", "wind", "architects"]},

{"content": "Thousands of Palestinians began the long, dusty walk from the south of Gaza toward Gaza City after a in the enclave on Friday. They found their city lying in ruins – yet were relieved to be returning home. Virtually the whole population of northern Gaza had been displaced since Hamas’ attack on October 7, 2023, led to Israel’s war in the enclave, and the area has been reduced to rubble over the past two years. Aerial footage shows vast stretches of land with nothing but ruins. There’s no infrastructure, no electricity and no running water. Yet for many of those making the trek on Friday, there is no question about returning. “I pray that God relieves our sorrow and distress and that people return to their homes. Even if the houses are destroyed, we will return, God willing,” said Ahmad Abu Watfa. Abu Watfa spoke to CNN on his way back home to Sheikh Radwan in Gaza City. He said he was feeling an overwhelming joy, even though he knew that it’s likely that nothing awaits him that he could call home. “There is no feeling more beautiful than this — the feeling of people returning from the south to the north,” he said. An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said that people were allowed to move from the south to the north via the coastal Al-Rashid Street and the Salah al-Din Road in the center of the Gaza Strip. For many residents of northern Gaza, Friday marked the second time they tried to return home. While Israel forced most residents of northern Gaza to leave the area early in the war, it briefly allowed people to return to some parts during the last ceasefire in January. But that homecoming was short lived for most, as Israel once again ordered a in early September, ahead of a ground invasion into the city. The IDF told CNN at that time that 640,000 people have left the city after the evacuation order. That number represented about 90% of Gaza City’s pre-war population, although it was not possible to verify that estimate. The situation in Gaza City was critical even before that ground offensive, with no fully functioning hospitals and few places to shelter. On Friday, medical teams from the Al Rantisi hospital in Gaza City returned to the facility to find it completely destroyed. Gaza’s deputy minister of health, Dr Yousef Abu Al Rish, shared a video from the scene with CNN that showed ruins and burned and destroyed medical equipment. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a United Nations-backed initiative, said that famine took hold of Gaza City in August and has since spread to the rest of the strip. As people began to return to the north, grim discoveries awaited them there. Footage from the city shows many multistory buildings completely flattened and others ripped apart by blasts. The whole area appears to be covered in grey dust, with mostly no other color visible. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa hospital in the north, told CNN that the bodies of at least 33 Palestinians have been recovered from Gaza City on Friday, after the Israeli military withdrew from some areas of the city. He said that it was impossible to identify some of the bodies, which is why they were sent to the hospital where forensic teams could examine them. Majdi Fuad Mohammad Al-Khour was standing amid the rubble of what used to be his house in Tal el Hawa when he spoke to CNN. He said two of his children – a son and a daughter – were killed in the war. His house was destroyed and nearly everything he ever owned is gone. “Forty years of work to build this home,” he said. “I am 70 years old now. Since I was 10, I worked until I could marry, build this house, and have children. Now I cannot work, and my health does not allow me to. Where should I go? My health is no longer what it was when I was young. I am old and sick, and I cannot work. My wife is also sick and cannot see with her eyes.” The Israeli military said on Friday that a ceasefire was now in effect in Gaza, with forces pulling back in accordance with the plan that was approved by the Israeli government. Under the ceasefire agreement, a 72-hour period for the held by Hamas started Friday. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will also be freed as part of the agreement. Sair Hikmat Subh from Beit Lahiya, a town just north of Gaza City said he was “tired and fed up” but hoping to return home soon. Subh spoke to CNN as he was dismantling and packing up his tent near Al-Rashid Street ahead of his trip north. “We are happy that the roadblock has been removed. Praise be to God for everyone’s safety. Of course I am happy!” he told CNN. However, he said that experience taught him to be cautious. “I have dismantled many tents and left many behind. I have been displaced nearly 20 times,” he said. Subh was likely correct to be cautious.

{"content": ", a Venezuelan opposition leader driven into hiding since a disputed election last year, has been awarded the for keeping “the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.” Machado received the accolade for tirelessly promoting democratic rights in Venezuela and “for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said Friday, announcing the award at a ceremony in Oslo. Born in Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, in 1967, Machado trained as an industrial engineer before entering politics. In 2002, she founded Súmate, a volunteer group that promotes political rights and monitors elections. Machado has described her life’s work as promoting “ballots over bullets.” The Nobel committee lauded her as “one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times.” “Oh my god … I have no words,” Machado said after being woken in the middle of the night by a phone call from the committee to tell her she had won the prize. In a statement accepting the award, Machado said the prize belongs to the people of Venezuela. “It is a recognition of what we have achieved together and a reminder of what still remains,” she said, adding that it should act as an impetus for Venezuelans to complete their task of achieving freedom. Although the White House the Nobel committee for overlooking the peacemaking efforts of Donald Trump – who has long publicly coveted the prize – the US president praised Machado in January for “peacefully expressing the voices and the WILL of the Venezuelan people.” On Friday, Trump said he spoke with Machado after the prize was announced, adding that she was “very nice” in their call. “The person who actually got the Nobel Prize called today, called me and said, ‘I’m accepting this in honor of you, because you really deserved it,’” the president said. Machado, who mentioned the call earlier on Friday, told El País newspaper that Venezuelans are “deeply grateful” to the president. Earlier, she publicly thanked him on social media “for his decisive support of our cause.” “We are on the threshold of victory, and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the people of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies in achieving freedom and democracy. Venezuela will be free!” she wrote on X. Tensions between the US and Venezuela have escalated in recent weeks. CNN has that Trump is conducting a broad strategy aimed at weakening President Nicolás Maduro, according to sources briefed on the administration’s plans. Machado’s work has become more difficult over time. Freedom House, a monitoring group, says Venezuela’s democratic institutions have deteriorated since 1999 and “have grown sharply worse in recent years” due to a harsh crackdown by the Maduro government. Machado attempted to run against Maduro in the 2024 presidential election, but her candidacy was voided by the regime. She then switched her support to the party of Edmundo González Urrutia, and worked to mobilize citizens and train election observers to try to ensure the vote was free and fair. Both Maduro and González claimed victory after the vote. When Venezuela’s government-aligned electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner, with 51.95% of the vote, opposition forces cried foul. Analysts reported “suspicious” data patterns in the reported results. One said there was about a “one in 100 million chance that this particular pattern will occur by chance.” After the election, Machado claimed she could prove that Maduro had lost “in a landslide to Edmundo, 67% to 30%.” Writing in the , she said her group had “receipts obtained directly from more than 80% of the nation’s polling stations.” The Nobel committee praised Machado on Friday for making sure “the final tallies were documented before the regime could destroy the ballots and lie about the outcome.” At the time, the Biden administration also concurred that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Maduro lost the vote. In the past year, laureate Maria Corina Machado has been forced to live in hiding. Despite serious threats against her life she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions of people. When authoritarians seize power, it is crucial to… After declaring victory, the Maduro government moved to crack down on dissent. Human Rights Watch, a monitoring group, said this year that the government has “killed, tortured, detained, and forcefully disappeared people seeking democratic change.” As a result, Machado has lived in hiding in Venezuela since last year, resurfacing briefly during protests in January. Speaking to CNN from an unknown location in August 2024, Machado said the regime had “lost total touch with reality and lost its social base,” allowing her movement – with no resources, and operating under strict censorship – to mobilize “millions of Venezuelans” committed to democracy. “Everyone in Venezuela is afraid of losing our freedom or even our lives,” she told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “But above all we are committed to make the truth prevail … and get a transition to democracy peacefully.” The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded each year to the individual or organization which has done the most to satisfy the terms set out in the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist whose fortune established the Nobel Prizes. The will says the award will be given to “the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses.” Jørgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said Machado had satisfied the full criteria. “She has brought her country’s opposition together. She has never wavered in resisting the militarization of Venezuelan society. She has been steadfast in her support for a peaceful transition to democracy,” he said Friday. González, Machado’s fellow opposition figure, said their movement is “very pleased” that the prize went to her. “This prize recognizes peace, a fundamental element in our (2024) electoral campaign. During the campaign we made peace the core of our ambitions, so we could have a peaceful and ordered transition. This is what this award exemplifies in the person of Maria Corina Machado, an upright, brave and courageous political figure” In selecting Machado as this year’s laureate, the committee signaled its concerns about the health of democracy worldwide, according to Karim Haggag, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). “The Nobel Committee clearly chose to highlight democracy as a priority area, underscoring that this award comes at a time of global backsliding of democratic values and norms,” Haggag told CNN. Nina Græger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said Machado’s award is “above all, a prize for democracy.” “Research shows that democracy is an important precondition for peace. At a moment when authoritarianism is on the rise across the world, this award highlights the courage of those who defend freedom with ballots, not bullets,” she told CNN. Analysts say the committee often uses the prize to send a message about areas of concern over the past year. The 2024 prize went to Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots Japanese organization of atomic bomb survivors, at a time when the world was once again confronting the specter of nuclear weapons, amid Russia’s threats during its war in Ukraine. Friday’s award came after a months-long campaign of self-promotion by US President Donald Trump, who stressed repeatedly that he believed he deserved the prize for ending “unsolvable” wars during his second term. Although Trump scored a major diplomatic victory this week in announcing the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, this likely came too late to influence the Nobel commitee. Nominations for this year’s prize closed on January 31, when Trump had only been in office for 11 days. The White House nonetheless criticized the committee for snubbing Trump. “President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives,” said communications director Steven Cheung. “The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had nominated Machado for the Peace Prize in 2024 when he was a US senator from Florida and while Venezuela was rocked by protests following its disputed presidential election. “Her tireless struggle for a free and just Venezuela is an inspiration and will always be remembered,” he wrote on X then. The prize also comes at a time of rising between the United States and Venezuela, with the US military carrying out lethal strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, which the Trump administration has deemed to be “narco-trafficking” vessels. The US has also deployed at least seven warships to the southern Caribbean and announced a $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest. The Venezuelan president has faced formal drug trafficking charges from the Justice Department since 2020, which he denies. The peace prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) and will be formally presented at a ceremony in Oslo in December. Frydnes, the chair of the committee, could not confirm whether Machado will be able to attend. “It’s a question of security. It’s too early to say. We always hope to have the laureate with us in Oslo, but this is a serious security situation which needs to be handled first,” Frydnes said.

Actresses Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler, who co-starred with Keaton in the 1996 comedy “The First Wives Club,” where they played divorcées seeking revenge on their ex-husbands, were among the many who paid tribute to her. Actress Bette Midler wrote Keaton’s death made her “unbearably sad” in . “She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star,” she said of Keaton. Hawn, meanwhile, said in an post a sentiment probably shared by fans and those who knew her alike: “Diane, we aren’t ready to lose you.” “We agreed to grow old together, and one day, maybe live together with all our girlfriends,” she added. “Well, we never got to live together, but we did grow older together. Who knows… maybe in the next life.” Oscar winner Leonardo DiCaprio remembered Keaton, whom he starred alongside in “Marvin’s Room” when he was only 18 years old, as “a legend, an icon, and a truly kind human being.” Kimberly Williams Paisley, who co-starred with Keaton in the 1991 film “Father of the Bride,” wrote, “Diane, working with you will always be one of the highlights of my life,” . The actor Ben Stiller called Keaton as “one of the greatest film actors ever” and “an icon of style, humor and comedy” And the Tony-winning playwright wrote Keaton “maintained a sense of self throughout her many roles that was a reminder to me as a young performer that the most interesting person you can mine are the many aspects of yourself.” The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awarded Keaton an Oscar for her star-making turn alongside Woody Allen in 1977’s “Annie Hall,” wrote she “embodied the contradictions of being human: funny and fragile, bright and bruised, always achingly honest” in . “Her spirit will live forever on screen, and in the hearts of all who saw themselves in her,” the post goes on. Keaton was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress four times in total, including for “Annie Hall.” Charles Miers, the publisher of Rizzoli, which published Keaton’s 2024 book “Fashion First” about her life and unique style, wrote in a statement, “She was herself at all times and in all ways: extremely thoughtful, very funny, generous to a fault, always energetically hardworking, and just plain true to people in the best possible ways.” “We are so honored to have worked with her, proud of the books we still have but so sad not to be working on another with her and her contagious enthusiasm,” he wrote. The , which honored the actress with a Life Achievement Award in 2017, wrote Keaton “filled our hearts with laughter and tears and the deepest of humanity for decades.” In , Paramount said Keaton became “a cinematic icon by doing the most daring thing of all: being wholly herself.” The company added, “Her legacy will continue to shine as brightly as she did on screen for generations to come.” SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents actors and other media workers, in a statement, “We’ve lost a legend.” “From stage to TV to film, she captivated audiences and captured hearts with her spirit and dedication,” the statement reads.", "tags": ["dead", "keaton", "mourns", "entertainment", "world", "diane"]},
{"content": "Planet-heating methane is escaping from cracks in the Antarctic seabed as the region warms, with new seeps being discovered at an “astonishing rate,” scientists have found, raising fears that future global warming predictions may have been underestimated. Huge amounts of methane lie in reservoirs that have formed over millennia beneath the seafloor around the world. can escape into the water through fissures in the sea floor, often revealing itself with a stream of bubbles weaving their way up to the ocean surface. Relatively little is known about these underwater seeps, how they work, how many there are, and how much methane reaches the atmosphere versus how much is eaten by methane-munching microbes living beneath the ocean. But scientists are keen to better understand them, as this super-polluting gas traps around 80 times more heat than carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. Methane seeps in Antarctica are among the least understood on the planet, so a team of international scientists set out to find them. They used a combination of ship-based acoustic surveys, remotely operated vehicles and divers to sample a range of sites in the Ross Sea, a bay in Antarctica’s Southern Ocean, at depths between 16 and 790 feet. What they found surprised them. They identified more than 40 methane seeps in the shallow water of the Ross Sea, according to the published this month in Nature Communications. Many of the seeps were found at sites that had been repeatedly studied before, suggesting they were new. This may indicate a “fundamental shift” in the methane released in the region, according to the report. Methane seeps are relatively common globally, but previously there was only one confirmed active seep in the Antarctic, said Sarah Seabrook, a report author and a marine scientist at Earth Sciences New Zealand, a research organization. “Something that was thought to be rare is now seemingly becoming widespread,” she told CNN. Every seep they discovered was accompanied by an “immediate excitement” that was “quickly replaced with anxiety and concern,” Seabrook said. The fear is these seeps could rapidly transfer methane into the atmosphere, making them a source of planet-heating pollution that is not currently factored into future climate change predictions. The scientists are also concerned the methane could have cascading impacts on marine life. It’s unclear why the methane seeps are happening in the region, but the researchers are investigating whether they might be affected by climate change. At the other end of the world, in the Arctic, increased underground methane release has been linked to climate change impacts, Seabrook said, including warmer temperatures, shifts in sea level and the continued, slow rise of land after the glaciers melted in the last Ice Age. It can create a feedback loop, Seabrook added, where climate change increases methane seeps, which themselves further increase the rate of climate change. The scientists are heading back to Antarctica next week for two months to analyze the seeps in more detail. Methane is a “real unknown, it’s going up in the atmosphere and we don’t know why,” said Andrew Thurber, a marine biology professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a study author. One of the most significant concerns is what’s happening in Antarctica, where there are vast reservoirs of methane, Thurber told CNN. If humans continue to warm the planet, these seeps could go from “a natural laboratory to an epicenter of danger,” he said. In some ways they “are like a dangerous animal,” he added. “They are amazing to study and understand, but one needs to be very aware of what they can do if provoked or underestimated.”", "tags": ["ocean", "antarctica", "scientists", "something"]},
{"content": "Melting sea ice and deforestation are continuing to drive many species toward extinction, with the latest Red List of Threatened Species showing that more than a quarter of all animals, plants and fungi assessed are at risk. Three species of Arctic seals now face extinction due to global warming, while half the planet’s birds are in decline due to habitat loss. But the return of the green sea turtle shows how, with coordinated conservation efforts, things can be turned around. The Red List, produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is the most authoritative global assessment of extinction risk of species. Released today at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi, the updated database includes 172,620 species of which 48,646 are threatened with extinction. “The Red List records symptoms of extinctions,” said Jon Paul Rodríguez, chair of IUCN’s Species Survival Commission, speaking to CNN via video call from the conference. “It’s like a thermometer when you are sick… you’re measuring something that tells you there’s something wrong; we have to act.” “The forces behind degradation of biodiversity are big and they’re widespread and strong,” he added. “But it’s not that we don’t know what to do, it’s just that there are fewer of us with fewer resources than are needed.” The research highlights the plight of Arctic seals, which rely on sea ice for breeding and raising their pups, and use it to rest and access foraging areas. As the Arctic has warmed than the rest of the world, sea ice is rapidly retreating. As a result, the hooded seal is listed as endangered, and the bearded seal and harp seal are near-threatened. Thinning sea ice will also threaten other seal species, walruses and marine mammals in the region, according to the update. It will have a wider ecosystem impact, affecting the food web as species such as polar bears have fewer seals to prey on. “Protecting Arctic seals goes beyond these species; it is about safeguarding the Arctic’s delicate balance, which is essential for us all,” said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group and biodiversity research leader at the Norwegian Polar Institute, in a statement. The update also included a significant reassessment of the state of the world’s birds, which involved thousands of experts over a nine-year period. It found that 61% of bird species are in decline globally, up from 44% in 2016. This is mainly due to habitat loss and degradation, driven especially by agriculture and logging. Madagascar, West Africa and Central America were highlighted as at-risk regions, due to the loss of tropical forest. Some threatened species, such as the black-casqued hornbill, found in West and Central Africa, are also under increased threat due to hunting and wildlife trade. Hornbills are a key example of the vital role birds can play in the wider ecosystem. In some areas, they are collectively able to disperse up to , making them critical in maintaining healthy and diverse ecosystems and restoring degraded areas. Birds also serve as pollinators, pest controllers and scavengers. Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International, the IUCN Red List authority on birds, said in a statement that the findings show “how deep the biodiversity crisis has become” and he urged governments to take strong action. The new research offered one glimmer of hope, as populations of the green sea turtle are rebounding thanks to conservation efforts. Found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide, it is now listed as of least concern rather than endangered, as populations have increased by around 28% since the 1970s. Decades of conservation action have mainly focused on protecting nesting females and their eggs and curtailing trade and the unsustainable harvest of turtles and their eggs. The report notes the efforts in Ascension Island, Brazil, Mexico and Hawaii as particularly successful, with some populations rebounding to close to pre-commercial exploitation levels. But it warns that the species is not in the clear yet, as much of its habitat is still vulnerable to coastal and marine development and climate change is also having an impact. The Red List is to refresh existing assessments and include species assessed for the first time. The last update was in March 2025. Rodríguez said that the database is the first step in developing conservation strategies and taking action. “Resources are limited and we have to prioritize. We have to think of ways to cleverly invest the money where it will have the biggest impact, and the Red List is a key piece of information to do that,” he said. The IUCN World Conservation Congress is held and is an opportunity for conservation leaders, academics, Indigenous peoples and decision-makers from government and business to work together on improving the natural environment. This year’s event in Abu Dhabi is the first time the Congress has been held in the Gulf region, and Emirati Razan Al Mubarak is the current IUCN president. “We look at the biggest challenges facing conservation around the world, and we try to build on the strengths and the knowledge of all of these voices,” said Rodríguez. “What comes out of the Congress is a good measure of what the world knows and what the priorities are.” Now, all eyes are on next month’s UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) held in Brazil. “We see climate and biodiversity as two sides of the same coin: damaging biodiversity affects the climate, improving biodiversity helps with the climate,” he added. “We hope the messages we can produce here will influence the discussions and the thinking of people at the climate COP.”", "tags": ["extinction", "red", "seals", "decline", "arctic", "list", "birds"]},
{"content": "stood inside a circle of her teammates on Friday, playing a tambourine. The superstar center was orchestrating the celebrations, just as she had orchestrated the performance that preceded them and, increasingly, the Aces’ dynasty itself. She contributed to practically every aspect of the Aces’ third WNBA title in four years – the talisman, finisher, creator and leader all rolled into one. “You have your Mount Rushmore, she’s alone on Everest,” Aces coach Becky Hammon said afterwards, per the Associated Press. “There’s no one around.” No one else in WNBA history has ever been named MVP, Finals MVP and Defensive Player in the same year. Even at a time when stars are proliferating across the league and when the quality of play is better than it has ever been, Wilson is still undeniably the best. For Hammon, “the skill set and the level” her team are at “is not comparable” to previous dynasties in WNBA history like the Houston Comets – who won four consecutive titles in 1997-2000 – and the Minnesota Lynx –who won four titles between 2011 and 2017. “I think these ladies are at the top of the game, and it is the best basketball that the W has ever seen from top to bottom,” she told reporters. And within this golden age of the WNBA, there is Wilson. Even just her stats from the Finals make for extraordinary reading. She contributed 31 points and nine rebounds in Friday’s Game 4, sunk the game-winner in Wednesday’s Game 3, and became the first player in WNBA Finals history to record three consecutive games with 25 or more points and 10 rebounds. But her influence runs deeper than that. There was a time this season when the Aces were almost dismissed as title contenders. They started the season 12-13, a sign, perhaps, of their failing powers after they had exited the playoffs in the semifinals last year. Then came a record 53-point defeat against Minnesota at home. Wilson, according to ESPN, sent her teammates a text which read: “If you weren’t embarrassed from yesterday, then don’t come into this gym. You’re not needed or wanted here. We need the mindset to shift, because that was embarrassing.” She “check(ed) on every single person,” teammate NaLyssa Smith recalled to ESPN. “You would think a person that’s a four-time MVP, with all these accomplishments, would really care just about moving themselves to the top. But (she) pours so much into other people.” After that, the Aces went on a 16-game winning streak, during which Wilson averaged a remarkable 26.1 points, 12 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.3 blocks and 1.6 steals. Wilson is still only 29 years old and already has won four MVP awards – more than any other player – and two Finals MVP awards. “Greatness is, like I said, just being patient, waiting on your turn, waiting on your moment,” she told reporters afterward. “I think that’s what defines us is you’ve got to be great when the lights aren’t on you. You’ve got to be great when nobody’s in the gym with you. You’ve got to be great when you may not get anything on the end. “That is what greatness is to me because that is consistency and that is just you doing the right things because it’s right. So I think that’s how I would redefine it, and I think that’s what you saw in this group. We had times where it was tested, battle tested, but like our plants, we just needed to grow with a little bit more sunshine, a little bit more water.” As for whether the Aces can continue building their dynasty, that is still unclear. The future of this team is uncertain, as much is across the WNBA right now with the league’s collective bargaining agreement expiring at the end of October. And, because of that, most players timed their contracts to expire at the end of this season too, meaning that there will be 123 free agents this offseason, according to . For the Aces, much depends on whether stars like Wilson, Jewell Loyd and Chelsea Gray will recommit to the franchise. But, for the moment, the Aces are focusing on what they have already built, the celebrations, and the tambourine. “I know everybody’s laughing that (the tambourine is) funny, and it is funny and it’s cute and it’s pink, but this is a symbol of just the joyfulness we have right now, and I’m grateful to be with this bunch,” Wilson said. “That ain’t the alcohol talking.”", "tags": ["confirms", "status", "wnba", "historic", "performance", "great", "finals", "generational", "ja"]},

A is about to develop off the Southeast coast and this coastal storm will bring some serious threats along with dreary weather for much of the East Coast into early next week. The upcoming storm will churn up dangerous seas and drive coastal flooding while also delivering drenching rain and strong winds. The combination of wind and rain will likely lead to travel headaches in the East, and could prove especially disruptive for major airport hubs from Washington, DC, to the greater New York City area. Its development hinges on the same potent cold front that brought refreshing fall air to millions in the United States.  That front is now draped over the Southeast, where it will linger into the weekend. The nor’easter is expected to develop along that stalled front on Saturday and spread hazardous weather along the coast from the Carolinas to the Northeast through the weekend. A nor’easter is just a coastal storm named based on the direction from which its winds slam into the coast: northeast. Nor’easters are notorious snow producers in winter, but they can happen at any time of year, bringing heavy rain instead. They’re most frequent between September and April and usually develop between Georgia and New Jersey. The strongest nor’easters are also by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution, a July found. This nor’easter looks to pack a punch, and its track and strength have come into better focus: The area from North Carolina through New Jersey and into coastal southern New England looks to bear the brunt of the storm’s disruptions. The nor’easter will develop on Saturday somewhere off the coast between Florida and South Carolina and strengthen on Sunday while hugging coastal North Carolina. Some areas near the North Carolina coast could receive up to half a foot of rain and gusty winds up to 50 mph. The nor’easter will also contribute to ongoing beach erosion in the state’s Outer Banks, where at least nine unoccupied homes have since September 30 due to intense wave action and erosion from recent storms. Disruptive weather will stretch farther north Sunday and Monday with several inches of rain possible along the rest of the mid-Atlantic coast and into southern New England. Parts of southern Delaware and eastern Maryland could also record up to half a foot of rain. Any areas caught under multiple rounds of this drenching rain could see localized flash flooding. ﻿Powerful winds will accompany this rain with prolonged gusts of 40 to 50 mph possible. Winds will whip along the Southeast coast starting Friday, maxing out later Saturday into Sunday for much of the mid-Atlantic coast. Some of the strongest gusts for New Jersey and southern New England will occur Sunday into Monday. A multi-day coastal flooding event could also unfold from the Outer Banks and north with tide levels later this week and this weekend just shy of their highest marks of the month. It will also drive turbulent seas and generate rough surf that could make swimming dangerous for hundreds of miles of coastline. After the storm moves away from the coast later Monday into Tuesday, the East could get a brief reprieve from the dreary weather. Then, yet another batch of unseasonable heat is expected to set in by late next week.

{"content": "“Bad Sports: When Fans Turn Violent” airs on Saturday, October 11 at 8pm ET on “The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper”. If you’re a sports fan there’s nothing quite like the Fall season on the calendar. Football is tightening its grip on our attention. The drama of playoff baseball is intensifying. The dawn of new basketball and hockey seasons are upon us as well. And if you prefer the kind of football played with your feet, you’ll find the passionate singing of international soccer fans filling stadiums around the world. But with this sports-inspired passion comes an all-too-common drama also where millions of fans find so much joy. Every week provides viral moments captured on cellphones of sports fans behaving badly, often erupting into life-altering brawls and chaos. In September, Anthony Thomas left the first NFL game of this season celebrating his team’s “big victory.”  Just outside the stadium where his hometown Washington Commanders beat the rival New York Giants, he heard a “commotion” erupt behind him. Thomas saw two men – wearing Commanders’ jerseys – unleashing a flurry of punches on another man in a blue Giants shirt. The crack of punches hitting the Giants fan can be heard on the cellphone video Thomas captured that afternoon. A young woman and a security guard stepped in to pull the two Commanders fans off the Giants fan who had fallen to the ground. One of the men wearing a Commanders jersey leaves the scene with blood on his face. As quickly as the fight started, it seemed to evaporate just as fast. Thomas doesn’t know what sparked the fight, but he says it’s just become part of the experience of attending a professional football game. “It happens at every game. Every single game,” said Thomas. Thomas is a high-profile chef in Washington, D.C. He has a growing social media presence and makes routine appearances on television cooking segments and even competed in a Food Network show called “Battle of the Brothers” in 2021. Four years ago, Thomas started noticing the changing dynamic of sports fans at games. That’s when he decided to start taking his own personal security officer to every football game. Thomas acknowledges this “sounds crazy” but he calls the 6-foot-7, 310-pound hired security officer an insurance policy. “There’s always one or two fans that are looking to impede on everyone else’s fun and try to find a way, if they have the losing team, to try to ruin the morale that’s going on in the stadium,” said Thomas. Over the last year, I’ve embarked on a journey to explore why so many sports fans turn into neanderthal spectators in the heat of athletic battle. We are there to admire the feats of the world’s premier athletes. We fill stadiums in our favorite team’s colors and jerseys and cheer young men and women who have reached the pinnacle of their sport. But the experience too often triggers barbaric rage. To help explore the answer this question, I turned to Bill Buford the author of “Among the Thugs” – one of my favorite sports books. Buford spent years immersing himself in the world of British hooligan soccer syndicates. He befriended a wild cast of characters that wreak havoc at soccer venues around Europe. “Being in a crowd at a live sporting event is one of the great dramas of human civilization that has been rarely understood and appreciated,” Buford told me in a London pub just blocks away from the Chelsea Football Club’s home stadium. “It is high theater without a script.” Buford traveled to games with British hooligans to understand the mind of a violent crowd. He witnessed gruesome fighting and fans crushed by mobs. His book is raw and jarring. There’s a scene where a hooligan bites the eye out of a police officer during a fight. In those days, Buford came to have a sixth sense of when a sports crowd was “about to go off” and spark “wild anarchic power.” “Big crowds are capable of so much power, so much destruction,” said Buford. “If you have a unified crowd, there’s a moment when you realize how powerful you are. And it’s very hard to stop a crowd.” Buford wanted to understand the psychology of what lures people – usually men – to feed into the violence inspired by a sporting event. And what he found is that in the rush of attending sporting events, there’s a connection and emotional transformation that takes place. “There is a nationalism that arises out of loyalty to your side,” said Buford. A few weeks ago, Joey Cromwell settled into his seat to watch the Cincinnati Bengals and Jacksonville Jaguars football game, he didn’t expect a seat in row 32 to get him too close to the action. It seemed like a perfectly safe distance from which to watch massive gladiators violently blocking and tackling each other. But at the end of the third quarter, a brawl between fans erupted two rows behind him and one of those fans was pushed into his lap. By the time the 40-year-old Bengals fan turned around and realized what was happening, his cellphone camera recorded a group of men throwing punches. “My wife, she actually, took off running because she was so scared. She’s like, ‘I don’t know what’s about to happen, but I’m getting the hell out of here,’” said Cromwell. “We spent a lot of money for those tickets. I literally had somebody fall on me.” Cromwell said the fight started with spectators arguing over someone standing up and blocking the view of the game for other fans. As Cromwell described what happened and how the tussle seemed to last nearly 10 minutes, you can tell he has a hard time believing something so trivial became so dramatic. “I’m like, ‘Really? This is what they’re fighting over? Oh wait, this is really serious. They’re really fighting,’” said Cromwell. After it all ended, Cromwell said an elderly couple sitting in the same rows were visibly terrified by what happened. Most of the fighting fans seemed to be escorted away from the section The scene returned to normal, and Cromwell said everyone went back to simply praying for the Bengals to win. I’ve thought about the fights I’ve witnessed at sporting events over the years and reflected about my conversation with Buford. Surely alcohol plays a factor, to a certain degree, but I sense there’s something else going on. We fill stadiums to watch sporting events where success is often measured by toughness and the ability to inflict pain on your opponent or overpower them in battle. And many of those players on the field are our heroes. Some of us sitting there as spectators absorb that mentality. Walking away from a fight or turning the other cheek at someone hurling insults your way would be an insult to our own ego and pride. And in these moments, it doesn’t take much to spark the flame of violence. “If you allow yourself to do violence, it’s a little bit like a person jumping off a diving board, or jumping out of a window, or it’s like you’re lurching into no rules. Anything goes. You know you’re doing something you shouldn’t do, and there’s this exhilarating moment of like the leap,” Buford said. And once a sports fan takes that leap into violence, Buford says, you cross a civil threshold, you are airborne and there’s no coming back.", "tags": ["stands", "happens", "game", "events"]},

A serious flood threat is on tap for some of the driest areas of the United States as an ailing former Hurricane Priscilla combines with another storm system to create a long-lasting rainfall event. More than an October’s worth of rain could fall within days in some areas of the Southwest and cause “potentially widespread flash flooding” and “significant impacts” as the week comes to a close, according to the Weather Prediction Center. And another tropical system following on the heels of Priscilla early next week could pile onto the flood threat. Periods of rainfall will likely begin to increase Thursday, but the flood threat really increases Friday. A Level 3 of 4 threat of flooding rainfall is in place for Friday into early Saturday across central and northeastern Arizona, including Flagstaff, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Serious flooding like what happened in 2018 because of a similar forecast instigated by remnants of Hurricane Rosa could happen in these areas, the WPC said. unfolded in Phoenix then after 2.36 inches of rain fell there during a single day, the city’s wettest October day on record.

Rainfall totals could be more than the entire October average in some areas. It’s possible Phoenix doubles its average October rain of just over a half-inch in a day or two. Flagstaff would need an inch and a half of rain to meet its average for the month. The higher elevations of northern Arizona are likely to see the heaviest totals, possibly up to 3 or 4 inches. That might not sound like much, but it can create serious problems in the desert where water runs off the dry ground quickly, especially if it falls fast enough.

Priscilla is expected to dissipate later Thursday to the west of Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula. However, its moisture-rich air will get scooped up by a weather system riding through a dip in the jet stream along the West Coast. This is a classic weather pattern that has historically been responsible for slingshotting Eastern Pacific hurricane remnants into the Southwest US where they can trigger flooding rain. Phoenix is coming off its 10th-wettest September after picking up 2.26 inches of rain, or nearly quadruple the month’s average. Much of that fell during the same storm system that caused the deadly flooding in Globe. Despite the recent drenching, the Valley of the Sun remains in severe to extreme drought. This might not be the end of the tropically-infused wet Southwest pattern either. Another Eastern Pacific tropical system could bring a new burst of drenching rain Sunday into Monday.

The storm will drive major coastal flooding and beach erosion alongside the heavy rain and potentially damaging wind. This disruptive weather will likely lead to travel headaches in the East and could be a nightmare for major airport hubs like Washington, DC, New York City and Boston. The nor’easter is expected to develop just offshore along a stalled front draped over the Southeast on Saturday and spread hazardous weather along the coast from the Carolinas to the Northeast through the weekend. A nor’easter is just a coastal storm named based on the direction from which its winds slam into the coast: northeast. Nor’easters are notorious snow producers in winter, but they can happen at any time of year, bringing heavy rain instead. They’re most frequent between September and April and usually develop between Georgia and New Jersey. The strongest nor’easters are also by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution, a July found. This nor’easter looks to pack a punch, and the area from North Carolina through New Jersey and into coastal southern New England will bear the brunt of the storm’s disruptions. A state of emergency will go into effect for New Jersey Saturday night ahead of the storm’s worst impacts, acting Gov. Tahesha Way announced Friday. “I urge all New Jerseyans to exercise caution, monitor local weather forecasts and warnings, stay informed on evacuation protocols, and remain off the roads unless absolutely necessary,” Way said in a statement. After developing Saturday somewhere off the coast between Florida and South Carolina, it will strengthen on Sunday while hugging coastal North Carolina. Up to half a foot of rain could fall near the North Carolina coast, paired with gusty winds up to 50 mph. The nor’easter will also contribute to ongoing beach erosion in the state’s Outer Banks, where at least nine unoccupied homes have since September 30 due to intense wave action and erosion from recent storms. The disruptive weather will stretch farther north Sunday and Monday with several inches of rain possible along the rest of the mid-Atlantic coast and into southern New England. Any areas caught under multiple rounds of this drenching rain could see localized flash flooding. Powerful winds will accompany this rain with prolonged gusts of 40 to 50 mph possible. Winds will start whipping up along the Southeast coast Friday, maxing out later Saturday into Sunday for much of the mid-Atlantic coast. Some of the strongest gusts for New Jersey and southern New England will occur Sunday into Monday and could reach 60 mph at times. Power outages are possible as these strong winds batter coastal areas for days. They could also stretch further inland to more heavily populated areas. A significant coastal flooding event will also unfold from the Outer Banks through the Northeast with tide levels this weekend just shy of their highest marks of the month. The combination of soaking rain and strong winds pushing water onshore will be potent: Dozens of coastal spots from North Carolina to New York are expected to reach moderate-to-major flood stage from this nor’easter. In Delaware and New Jersey – particularly the southern part of the state – coastal flooding could get bad enough to cause some roads to become impassible and some structures to flood, according to the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey. Water levels could rise above 8 feet Atlantic City, New Jersey, – the highest level since in 2012 – and enter major flood stage on Sunday afternoon. That’s enough to trigger widespread flooding of roads in the area with some neighborhoods potentially becoming cut off due to the water, according to . The nor’easter will also drive turbulent seas and generate rough surf that will make swimming dangerous for hundreds of miles of coastline. After the storm moves away from the coast later Monday into Tuesday, the East could get a brief reprieve from the dreary weather. Then, yet another batch of unseasonable heat is expected to set in by late next week.

{"content": "Curved lines and block colors in shades of orange, yellow and blue create the image of an artist, framed by a border of abstract shapes. Look a little closer and you can see the artist’s beret with concentric circles, perched atop the solitary figure’s head as they lean over their work. The painting is by Nigerian artist Uzo Egonu, as part of a series titled “Stateless People,” made in 1981. Egonu settled in Britain in the 1940s, where he spent most of his career until his death in 1996 in London. As an artist yearning for his homeland, Egonu crafted paintings that spoke to feelings of statelessness and the complexity of migration. Think of modern art and you may think of Pablo Picasso, Georgia O’Keeffe or Salvador Dalí. However, a new exhibition at London’s Tate Modern gallery shows how Nigerian artists have contributed to the movement throughout the 20th century. Egonu is one artist among the more than 50 represented in “ ” — the first show at the museum to trace modern art from the country. It spans over 250 works created in the 1940s during British colonial rule, through to independence in 1960 and into the postcolonial period of the 1970s and 1980s. “Where we would often associate modernism with European art history, there were in fact multiple contexts within which the language of modern art developed and evolved,” said Osei Bonsu, a curator of International Art at the Tate Modern. Nigeria was a key hub for the development of modern African art, in part due to its colonial connections with Britain — several of the artists featured in the show had trained in London or other European cities before returning back to Nigeria, blending both European and indigenous techniques and forms within their work. As the country achieved independence from British rule, artists debated what new forms of nationhood, identity and art could look like. And while some techniques, such as uli — a traditional design practice indigenous to Igbo land in southeastern Nigeria, where women painted directly onto their bodies or created wall murals — may not have been viewed as modernist at the time, they incorporated modernist ideas such as improvisation and harmony through the use of positive and negative space, said Bonsu. One artist who is credited with pioneering Nigerian modernism is the sculptor and painter Ben Enwonwu. “His works were the cultural background to our growing up,” said Sylvester Okwunodu Ogbechie, professor of History of Art and Architecture at the University of California, Santa Barbara and author of the 2008 biography “Ben Enwonwu: The Making of an African Modernist”. “Enwonwu made it possible to think about the arts as a respectable profession. In terms of Africa, he was the first African artist to gain global recognition and global prestige.” Born in 1917 to an elite family in Onitsha, in the southeastern region of Nigeria, Enwonwu earned a scholarship to train at the Slade School of Art in London. Contemporary critics placed him in the same — if not higher — calibre as European modern masters, while famed British sculptor Henry Moore saw Enwonwu as a protégé and even bought one of his early works, said Ogbechie. There is a wider recognition that artists from Africa, from this time, have perhaps been sidelined in comparison to their western peers. Helene Love-Allotey, the head of Modern and Contemporary African Art at Bonhams In 1957, Enwonwu was commissioned to create , which elevated his already-respected artistic profile and prestige throughout the countries under British colonial rule as well as those that had recently gained independence. Yet Enwonwu also connected his Igbo ethnic identity and heritage with his classical art training in other aspects of his work. He used traditional sculpture techniques and tools inherited from his father, and in his paintings portrayed Igbo masquerade culture — a traditional ritual where masks, costumes and performance personify ancestral spirits. “He foregrounded African cultural registers in his work,” said Ogbechie. “He was very insistent on the fact that if Monet could paint church facades and hay bales and water lilies and be considered a modern artist, there was no reason why he couldn’t paint masquerades and African market scenes and have them received in the same manner.” Another artist now receiving recognition further afield is the potter and ceramicist Ladi Kwali, whose portrait appears on the 20 Nigerian naira note. Born in the Gwari region of northern Nigeria, Kwali became the first female trainee at the Pottery Training Centre in Abuja in 1954, and is known for infusing her modern ceramics training with traditional influences. “I’ve been very drawn to her way of making, and I think it’s really interesting that she stuck to her own identity and maintained a certain way of doing things,” said Helene Love-Allotey, the head of department and a specialist in Modern and Contemporary African Art at Bonhams, a private auction house in London. Love-Allotey pointed to Gwari traditions, such as Kwali’s aunts teaching her techniques including handcoiling, and the recurring motifs of lizards and fish seen on her bowls and water vessels as examples of this blend within Kwali’s work. Kwali is also a focal point of the current exhibition ” on show at the Ford Foundation Gallery in New York. Earlier this year in Paris, the Centre Pompidou’s summer exhibition, titled “ ,” also explored the role, importance and influence of African artists in the Modernist movement. Besides institutional recognition, African modern and contemporary artists have also gained greater commercial interest in recent years. In 2023, Kwali and her female peers from the Abuja Pottery Training Centre saw when their work was auctioned at Bonhams, while in 2018, an Enwonwu painting, “Tutu,” sold for $1.67 million. An this week of Nigerian modernist work will also feature pieces by Enwonwu and Egonu. “There is a wider recognition that artists from the continent, from this time, have perhaps been sidelined in comparison to their western peers,” said Love-Allotey, who also created and runs the Instagram account , which celebrates such artists. The growing appetite from both private collectors and public audiences builds on years of scholarship by academics such as Ogbechie, and curator Bonsu hopes that this mainstream interest alongside the exhibition will prompt visitors to ask questions and reflect on their own cultural heritage. “We don’t always center African stories when we talk about world history,” he said. “This is an opportunity to think about the immense contributions that African artists have made towards art and art history, but also to society at large.”", "tags": ["recognition", "nigeria", "modern", "afield", "art", "artists"]},
{"content": "The 2025 Nobel Prize in literature has been awarded to László Krasznahorkai, a Hungarian writer who said his dark and difficult novels aim to examine reality “to the point of madness.” Announcing the prize at a ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden, on Thursday, the Nobel Committee praised Krasznahorkai “for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art.” When only a handful of his works were translated into English, the literary critic James Wood wrote that Krasznahorkai’s books were once “passed around like rare currency.” That has since changed, and the Nobel Committee said the award recognized a body of work that has won widespread acclaim and “is characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess.” Born in Gyula, Hungary, in 1954 – two years before the Hungarian Revolution that was met with brutal repression by the Soviet Union – Krasznahorkai has previously said he grew up “in a predicament and a country where a person accursed with a heightened aesthetic and moral sensitivity like me simply cannot survive.” Dubbed the “contemporary master of the apocalypse” by the late American essayist Susan Sontag, Krasznahorkai’s novels – often set in shivering Central European villages – depict townsfolk searching for meaning in symbols scattered across a godless world. This year’s laureate in literature László Krasznahorkai is a great epic writer in the Central European tradition that extends through Kafka to Thomas Bernhard, and is characterised by absurdism and grotesque excess. In “The Melancholy of Resistance,” published in 1989, a travelling circus arrives in a shabby town, bringing with it only the carcass of a giant whale. The whale feels like a potent symbol – a potential nod to Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick,” or even to Jonah being swallowed by a huge fish in the Old Testament – but Krasznahorkai’s meaning remains obscure. Instead, one of the villagers, Mrs Eszter, sees the arrival of the circus as a chance to create chaos. The “mysterious and menacing spectacle sets extreme forces in motion, prompting the spread of both violence and vandalism,” the committee said. Mrs Eszter moves to stamp out the violence and claim power over the town, and soon has “swept away the old and established the new,” Krasznahorkai writes. While the novel reads like an allegory for the rise of fascism, it is not clear if there is a lesson Krasznahorkai wants his readers to glean from it. His novels often resist neat moral solutions. In an interview this year, he stated flatly that “art is humanity’s extraordinary response to the sense of lostness that is our fate” – and it is not, one might presume, advice about what to do with that “lostness.” The first thing that strikes a reader of Krasnahorkai is the sentences: long, serpentine, self-revising. The novelist once said that the period “doesn’t belong to human beings – it belongs to God.” The result, as his translator George Szirtes says, is a “slow lava-flow of narrative.” While the world of his novels is often sparse, the sentences are dense as granite. In his 1985 debut novel “Sátántangó,” in which villagers try to decipher whether the new arrival Irimiás is a con-man or a savior, a sentence describing a sunrise runs for the best part of a page: “Sátántangó” was made into a film in 1994 by the Hungarian director Béla Tarr, with whom Krasznahorkai has collaborated on various screenplays. Despite its seven-hour run-time, Sontag said the film was “enthralling for every minute.” His 2021 work “Herscht 07769” has been hailed as a great contemporary German novel, the committee said, “on account of its accuracy in portraying the country’s social unrest.” The novel – which is written in a single sentence and opens with a comically bleak epitaph, “hope is a mistake” – describes how a physics student, convinced that his calculations show the world is set to break down, tries to enlist the help of then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, writing her a series of deranged letters. Describing Krasznahorkai as “a great epic writer in the Central European tradition” running through Franz Kafka to Thomas Bernhard, the committee notes that his later works adopt a more contemplative tone influenced by his travels to China and Japan. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, of whom Krasznahorkai has been a critic, was among those to congratulate the author, posting on X that the win “brings pride to our nation.” Last year, the Nobel went to , a South Korean author who was lauded for her “intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life.” The 2023 prize was awarded to , a Norwegian novelist and playwright whose “radical reduction of language and dramatic action expresses the most powerful human emotions of anxiety and powerlessness in the simplest terms,” the committee said. The prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million).", "tags": ["hungary", "lászló", "wins", "work", "prize", "terror", "literature", "apocalyptic"]},
{"content": "The world of high fashion is increasingly accessible. Anyone with a phone and the internet can get a front row view of fashion week, connect with their favorite designers and immerse themselves in the virtual worlds of luxury brands. But, while people may be looking, liking and following fashion more than ever, this isn’t necessarily translating to sales. Leaders across the industry are fighting to combat a global luxury slowdown and searching for new ways to maintain relevancy, reinvigorate their relationships with shoppers, while improving their bottom line. This pinch was particularly felt at the Spring-Summer 2026 shows in Paris, many of which had fewer seats for guests and less elaborate set designs than usual, despite there being an unprecedented number of designer debuts. An overwhelming 111 fashion brands featured on the nine-day schedule during Paris Fashion Week, which concluded on Tuesday. Front rows were packed with A-list celebrities and influencers, and show content flooded social media, but it was difficult to envisage how each brand could cut through the noise and reach people navigating rising costs of living and other uncertainties in a fast-changing world. But some houses did. Throughout the week, the designers that left a lasting impression created moments that sparked meaningful conversation and demonstrated how fashion’s influence could extend beyond the runway and shape what regular people wear on the streets. The idea of clothes — especially expensive clothes — looking good on the wearer shouldn’t be a novel idea, yet recent years have seen some designers become fixated with expressing artistic creativity or generating shock value, rather than designing for wider appeal. That wasn’t the case at Spanish house Loewe, where co-creative directors Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez presented their first collection of joyful, highly wearable pieces. saw him masterfully steer the luxury house away from the oversized streetwear it had become known for in recent years and back to its elegant roots. The same could also be said for Michael Rider at Celine, who presented his second collection for the French brand to guests including actors Uma Thurman and Natasha Lyonne, and the South Korean singer Kim Tae-Hyung, known professionally as V. There were flattering party dresses, mannish trousers and long coats, as well as Celine-branded sweaters and accessories featuring its “Triomphe” monogram. Much like in July, the womenswear styles felt preppy and classic, and reflected his experience as an American (who formerly designed for Polo Ralph Lauren) in Paris. Several models walked with their jackets and bags tucked under their arms, creating a relatable image of a person on the go. Backstage, Rider shared that he worked on both the men’s and women’s collections at the same time, hence the feeling of “continuity,” and his desire for timelessness and consistency. “We’ll never be a brand that jumps from concept to concept,” he said. “You may not be the person in the strangest thing that you might throw away, but you’ll have the best coat, and you have the attitude to wear it.” Rider said he placed emphasis on making “something that lasts.” He added: “There’s a discretion at Celine that I really appreciate, and I think there’s a tension between that and being at Paris Fashion Week, which isn’t very discreet anymore.” Equally unobtrusive is Nadège Vanhee’s vision for Hermès, and this year marks over a decade in her tenure as the French brand’s creative director. Hermès is a brand with much lore around its leather goods, primarily handbags, which represent its core business and fuel its prestige. Some of those featured on the sandy catwalk created for the Spring-Summer 2026 show, alongside caramel-hued garments in tactile textures like suede and quilt. The designs leaned young — the opening look was a leather bra top with chain detailing that hung down the front, paired with Bermuda shorts, an open coat and knee-high boots — but, overall, the quiet confidence of Vanhee’s shows offers a reminder that there is strength in restraint. There were nudity and overt expressions of sex across the runways this season, reflecting the skin-baring age we are living through — see pop stars performing in lingerie and the ever-present “nude dress.” So when Tom Ford designer Haider Ackermann presented just enough sex to leave onlookers wanting more, we leaned in. His interpretation of sexy was subtle — it was about a mood, not an exposed body part. Models walking his sultry runway seduced the audience in beautiful suiting, a dress with a plunging neckline that mirrored an equally high slit. There was lace and leather, of course, and a series of skirt suits and trenchcoats — perhaps with nothing underneath? — finished to give a lacquered, glistening effect. Fashion’s recent obsession with nostalgia, be that the 70s, 90s or Y2K style codes, is well documented and perhaps indicative of an industry weathering an identity crisis. While some of the standout collections this season did look to the past, the aim for many was to reinvent, not recreate. For his , Matthieu Blazy threw open the windows and breathed fresh air into his new creative home — honoring elements of the 115-year-old brand’s past in a way that felt genuinely new. It wasn’t a history lesson but rather an exercise in experimentation through materials, silhouettes and styling. Tweed skirt suits, once the uniform of maturing high society ladies, were lighter in weight and softer in shape — the skirts, many with pockets — slung low on the hip. Dramatic ball skirts blooming with color and texture were styled with simple silk Ts and cotton shirts. In a fun twist, Blazy added moldable wire to the classic 2.55 bag so that it could be scrunched up and shaped by the owner. Chloé’s Chemena Kamali surprised those watching her show with a series of brightly colored floral dresses at the top of her collection — a departure from the muted, neutral tones often associated with the brand. This season she said she wondered what Chloé couture might look like. The answer was an easy-going reinterpretation of classic couture techniques — including draping and pleating — but done with simple cotton fabrics to create casual dresses you might wear to a pool party rather than a formal gala. Is Miuccia Prada aware of the tradwives of TikTok? Who knows, but this season at Miu Miu she took a stab at repositioning — shifting it away from the social-media-generated, 1950s perfect homemaker aesthetic by styling it over triangle bikinis and heavy jumpers and jackets. According to show notes, she wanted to afford the humble garment a “nobility and respect,” hinting at this being a conversation about class, too, though an expensive fashion apron likely out of reach for anyone who wears one to work is hardly going to disrupt the system. Good design is ultimately about finding solutions — ideally, ones that are as beautiful as they are smart. Stella McCartney has been loud and consistent in her calls for fashion to be more environmentally aware and each season, she typically unveils a new innovation with this in mind. Last week the British fashion designer closed her show at Paris’ Pompidou Centre with three final, feathery looks made with “Fevvers,” a new naturally dyed, plant-based alternative to animal feathers. “It’s weird to me that feathers plucked from a bird are seen as delicate in fashion,” said McCartney backstage after her show. “You can escape into fashion and have beauty and dream but you don’t have to kill animals.” Pushing the boundaries of clothing and challenging Western ideals around them is what made the arrival of Japanese designers in Paris in the 1970s and ’80s such a groundbreaking cultural movement. Today, many of those labels remain a fixture on the Paris Fashion Week schedule — and continue to fly the flag for originality and independent thinking. At Issey Miyake, designer Satoshi Kondo shares the same democratic values as the brand’s late eponymous founder, while also challenging how clothes are made and worn. For Spring Summer 2026, he presented tops in all kinds of haphazard forms: some — like the one worn by the American model Maggie Maurer — appeared shrunken; others looked like they had been thrown on in a drunken stupor and worn sideways or backwards. But there was also lots of ingenious layering that would be more easily incorporated into the everyday wardrobe. Later that evening, Yohji Yamamoto’s show took place at his usual venue, Hôtel de Ville. A note left by the designer on every seat encouraged guests to “be present” and put their phones away. “Let the moment, the movement and the clothing speak to you — they are meant to be felt with your senses, not merely digitally recorded,” it read. But many attendees simply want to capture the fruits of Yamamoto’s twilight years before his eventual retirement, which is sure to leave a gaping void in fashion. Yamamoto, who this week turned 82, surely understands the impact that would have: His latest show featured a subtle but heartfelt tribute to Giorgio Armani in the form of tunic dresses printed with images of the late designer’s past campaigns. There were also many of Yamamoto’s signature styles, like dresses that were asymmetrically cut or effortlessly draped. Also not to be overlooked are the cult Japanese labels Sacai, by Chitose Abe, and Undercover, by Jun Takashi, which are never the flashiest on the schedule, yet find ways to balance consistency with newness that keep their devotees coming back for more. Among the highlights at Sacai were blue jeans turned on its head, and at Undercover, a kooky offering of mismatched buttons, distorted jackets and dotty garments, as Takahashi imagined stepping into the shoes of an inexperienced clothes maker — which is hardly the case with the designer himself.", "tags": ["paris", "clothes", "week", "fashion"]},
{"content": "After a month of designer debuts — more than a dozen across fashion weeks in London, Milan and New York — the task fell to Chanel’s new artistic director, Matthieu Blazy, to present his vision for the future of one of history’s most storied houses. Bringing to a close on Monday evening, the highly anticipated collection reveal was held where Chanel has frequently staged shows since 2007: the historic Grand Palais, which recently underwent a multiyear, . The set wasn’t just a whole new world, it was an entire solar system. Enormous glowing planets hung overhead; others were installed at ground level, punctuating the venue’s gleaming black floor. Stars including Margot Robbie, Penélope Cruz and Pedro Pascal sat front row, as did the label’s newly anointed brand ambassadors and Nicole Kidman — a return of sorts for Kidman, who was once the face of Chanel No. 5 perfume. The impressive glass-domed building stands less than a mile from Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel’s first couture house on Rue Cambon, a historic Paris address the company still occupies. As a tribute, the Grand Palais’ main entrance now bears Chanel’s name, carved in stone — a symbolic gesture that was no doubt part of the deal struck when the label contributed a reported 25 million euros ($29 million) to the restoration project. What would Coco have made of the show last night? It’s impossible to know, but fun to speculate. Would she have enjoyed the references to some of her earliest hallmarks — a classic black tweed jacket embellished with white camellias, her favorite flower, for instance — or would she have told Blazy to forget the past entirely? She was a shrewd saleswoman, notoriously outspoken and often dismissive of nostalgia. “Fashion should die and die quickly, in order that commerce may survive,” she once said. “The more transient fashion is the more perfect it is. You can’t protect what is already dead.” Following that logic, and with both Chanel and her famous successor Karl Lagerfeld (who shared a similar disdain for nostalgia) gone, Blazy has creative license to take the house in an entirely new direction, something his immediate predecessor Virginie Viard did not attempt during her comparatively short tenure. Lagerfeld’s right-hand woman for decades, Viard presided over the brand following his death, in a role that was widely presumed to be transitional. While Chanel performed well during this five-year period (as one of the many luxury labels to enjoy pandemic-related sales surges), the energy of the collections and shows waned, and Viard appeared to keep her head down. Her approach stood in sharp contrast to that of Lagerfeld, whose image became arguably more ubiquitous than Chanel’s interlocking double-C logo across his 36-year reign. He was largely credited with awakening Chanel from a period of slumber after its founder’s death, turning the brand into the powerhouse that it is today. The late German designer was also a showman who reveled in the attention his signature white ponytail, black tie, gloves and sunglasses attracted. By contrast, Blazy cuts a remarkably less recognizable figure — though his low-key personal style of jeans and T-shirt, and his under-the-radar public profile, should not be underestimated. Having risen though the fashion industry working for some of its most widely respected designers, including Raf Simons and Phoebe Philo, Blazy held roles within the design studios of Maison Margiela, Celine and Calvin Klein. In 2021, he became the creative director of Italian house Bottega Veneta, where he enjoyed a short but very positive run at the Kering-owned brand. Taking the creative helm of Chanel as only the fourth artistic director to ever lead the house, Blazy has been entrusted with one of the biggest and most sought-after — although perhaps not the most challenging — jobs in fashion. The 41-year-old French-Belgian designer has entered one of today’s few privately owned luxury fashion houses. With approximately $20 billion in annual revenue, Chanel is one of the world’s most powerful luxury brands. But unlike labels operating within conglomerates like LVMH and Kering (which are obliged to post quarterly financials), the company can work on its future with a little more privacy. So, while there’s an urgency to the challenges facing some of Blazy’s peers at rival fashion houses, who are stepping into business with rapidly declining sales amid a sector-wide slowdown, he may be given the luxury of time to find his rhythm. During an with The New York Times in December, months ahead of Monday’s show, Chanel’s president Bruno Pavlovsky said, “We are not trying to put everything on the table from Day 1,” adding: “We need to give it time.” But this debut was hardly a gentle easing in. In fact, in an exclusive interview with the Business of Fashion, published Monday, Blazy said he designed the new collection as if it was his last. The Spring-Summer 2026 show opened with a suit, the jacket cropped at the waist and the sleeves rolled up. The slouch of the suit was a subtle precursor to what was to come — a collection full of movement. At one point, ‘90s anthem “Rhythm is a Dancer” came on, the energizing dance track bringing the clothes to life as they slinked, swished and bounced their way down the runway. Edges were frayed and raw, expressing a softness or, perhaps, youthful carelessness: Even the bags were scrunched up and half open, as if their contents were about to spill out onto the floor. Nods to Chanel’s classic codes were seen throughout, though they were modernized — boucle jackets were lighter, their silhouettes softer. The final ensemble, a colorful, voluminous skirt that looked like it had been made from a combination of shredded flowers and feathers, paired with a simple silk T–shirt, was joyful and frenetic — much like the audience, which gave Blazy a standing ovation as he came out to take his first bow for Chanel. Blazy is a designer who is often praised for putting craft at the center of his design practice, and tonight’s show was another demonstration of this. Despite all the potential distractions and hype — the buzz of the debut, the dramatic set and the A-list front row — the clothes came first, that much was clear.", "tags": ["man", "fashion", "jobs", "biggest", "debut"]},

In 2023, Radicondoli launched offering up to 20,000 euros, or about $23,000, to anyone willing to buy and live in one of its vacant homes, along with an extra 6,000 euros in contributions towards expenses like heating and transport. This year, the town expanded the plan. Instead of only helping buyers, it will now cover half of the first two years’ rent for new tenants through early 2026. “The housing scheme, initially launched two years ago, is being boosted,” says mayor Francesco Guarguaglini, who is orginally from Radicondoli. “We’ve earmarked over 400,000 euros ($465,000) this year to support new home purchases and rentals, alongside other key measures like financial aid to students, public transport commuters and green energy subscribers.” Guarguaglini says the approach sets Radicondoli apart from Italy’s better-known “one-euro home” programs. “We distinguish ourselves from the sale of houses at one euro. Here, our homes have a value,” he says. “Sociality, hospitality and numerous cultural initiatives are the added value alongside the strategic location of the village.” The empty homes, available for both rent and purchase, include one-bedroom apartments in the village’s historic center, as well as Tuscan farmhouses on the outskirts. The historic center’s apartments tend to be smaller, cozy units with one or two bedrooms, while homes on the outskirts include spacious farmhouses surrounded by olive groves and vineyards. Each comes with its own character, often featuring exposed beams, stone walls, or original artisan brickwork. Prices start at around 50,000 euros for smaller units and climb to 100,000 euros or more for larger homes. Most are in reasonably good condition, the mayor says, but a few may need roughly 10,000 euros of renovation. That means a buyer using the full 20,000-euro bonus could acquire a small apartment for roughly 30,000 euros or $35,000. Renters can also benefit. A 60- to 80-square-meter home that normally costs about 400 euros a month a month would drop to 200 euros under the subsidy. There’s a catch, of course. To qualify, new residents must stay for at least 10 years if they buy a home, or four years if they rent. Radicondoli’s population began shrinking in the 1950s, when younger residents left for jobs in larger cities. Guarguaglini says about 15 elderly residents die each year while only about three babies are born. The mayor hopes the new program will bring back some of the grandeur and vitality that the village was known for when it was a wool-production hub in the 14th century. It still displays some of that history — a maze of arches and brownish-red stone dwellings sits alongside lavish palazzos that once belonged to wealthy wool merchants. Some locals still live in “tower-homes” embedded within the village walls, relics of its medieval past. “Since we launched the scheme in 2023, we’ve funded 23 property sales and lured some 60 new residents, mostly Italians and a few foreigners including Belgians,” Guarguaglini says. “But we need to do more.” He hopes to raise the population to at least 1,000. Those who plan to transform one of Radicondoli’s neglected homes into a holiday rental receive extra support from the municipality. This includes financial aid for renovations and rental loans for tenants, helping make the village more attractive for entrepreneurs and seasonal tourism. The municipality offers additional support for people who renovate neglected properties, including loans and aid for rental conversions. International families setting up home in Radicondoli are eligible for university grants and school book vouchers, helping make the move easier for those with children. Radicondoli lies about 40 minutes from Siena and over an hour from Florence. Though quieter than Tuscany’s tourist centers, it shares their appeal: wine, olive oil, and food. Local specialties include the Cinta Senese cold cuts, ribollita soup, and handmade pici pasta with wild boar or porcini mushrooms. The village also offers a range of cultural and outdoor activities. Residents and visitors can take guided tours of the historic center, explore artisan workshops, or attend folkloristic festivals and fairs throughout the year. Nature lovers can enjoy trekking, cycling, and horseback-riding routes across the lush countryside. The Radicondoli Energy Museum, known as “Le Energie del Territorio,” highlights the area’s geothermal energy production. “Our village is green, we use geothermal energy produced on our territory and get paid royalties by a national energy provider,” says Guarguaglini. “So, it is also quite a rich village, despite many people having fled.” Would-be residents can browse listings on the town’s only real estate agency, VP Immobiliare, or national property sites such as idealista.it and immobiliare.it. Homes are also available in Belforte, a smaller district about 10 minutes away. Among them is a 316-square-meter house with beam ceilings and brick walls listed for 72,000 euros, or roughly $84,000. Belforte is even quieter than Radicondoli, but equally picturesque. Its residents live in stone houses connected by cobbled alleys, and the village maintains a small but lively community life with bars, a mini-market, and local restaurants. In summer, the village occasionally hosts music concerts and huge sunset gatherings in the main piazza.

Diwali comes from the Sanskrit word deepavali, meaning “row of lights.” It marks the triumph of light over darkness, of good over evil. Though Diwali traditions vary according to region and religion, the myths and historical stories behind the holiday share themes of justice and liberation.

Diwali is largely observed by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists, but much like Christmas, the holiday transcends religion and is now celebrated by many people outside those traditions. The meaning of the festival varies by community and region. One of the legends at the heart of Diwali comes from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana.

{"content": "A 2,000-year-old tunnel once used by Roman emperors to slip into the Colosseum unseen will open to the public this month, offering visitors a rare glimpse of the arena’s imperial backstage. Known as the Passage of Commodus, the 180-foot corridor was built beneath the amphitheater to let emperors and VIP guests reach their seats in the imperial box without mingling with the crowds. The passage takes its name from Emperor Commodus, the ruthless leader who governed from 177 to 192 CE and was nearly assassinated in the underground walkway. Moviegoers will remember Commodus as Joaquin Phoenix’s scheming emperor in “Gladiator” — the one who murdered his father, Marcus Aurelius, and faced Russell Crowe’s Maximus in the arena. In real life, Commodus’ vanity went further. He fought in gladiatorial bouts dressed as Hercules, killing weakened fighters and even animals — once beheading an ostrich before a cheering crowd, according to the Colosseum Archaeological Park. The hidden corridor was first uncovered between 1810 and 1814 by French excavators under architect Carlo Lucangeli, then reopened in 1874 and studied again in the 1990s. During the 2020–2021 restoration of the entire site, archaeologists fully mapped the tunnel and began a new phase of conservation. The recent restoration removed centuries of dust and grime, reattached fragile plaster using laser tools, and revealed marble-lined walls etched with landscapes and mythological scenes — including the story of Dionysus, god of wine and revelry. Near the entrance, carvings of boar hunts, bear fights and acrobats recall the spectacle that once filled the arena. “Once this passage is now open to the public, visitors will appreciate what it was like to be an emperor,” said archaeologist Barbara Nazzaro, who led the work. Massimo Osanna, director general of Italy’s museums, called the reopening “a significant milestone” that blends research and preservation. New features such as a tactile map and video reconstructions aim to make the site “truly accessible and inclusive for all audiences.” The vaulted passage, added in the first and second centuries after the Colosseum’s initial construction, consists of three branches: two running east–west and one north–south. The restoration includes lighting that recreates daylight from long-sealed skylights, plus glass panels allowing visitors to watch archaeologists at work. A new excavation set for next year will trace the tunnel’s route — possibly toward the gladiators’ barracks. The project was funded by the Colosseum Archaeological Park and Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR).", "tags": ["beneath", "opening", "tunnel", "emperors", "secret"]},

However, the supermarket store manager told NHK the bear didn’t seem interested in food. “It seemed like it had entered the store, wanted to leave but couldn’t, and then became agitated,” he said. As the manager tried to evacuate customers from the store, the bear ran out. “I often heard news reports about bears entering stores, but I never imagined one would actually come to ours,” the manager told NHK. Earlier this month, two deaths were attributed to bear attacks, taking the annual toll to 7.

{"content": "Two powerful offshore earthquakes struck off the southern Philippines on Friday, killing at least seven people, while towns near the epicenter suffered structural damage and authorities warned of strong aftershocks. The first quake of magnitude 7.4, in waters off the town of Manay in the province of Davao Oriental, triggered a tsunami alert for coasts within 300 km (186 miles) of the epicenter, but the warnings for the Philippines and Indonesia were subsequently lifted. A second earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the same area seven hours later, triggering a new tsunami warning, with the country’s seismology agency Phivolcs warning of possible waves that could be more than one meter (3.2 feet) higher than normal tides. People living near coastal areas in the southern Philippines were “strongly advised to immediately evacuate” to higher ground, or move further inland, it said in an advisory. Phivolcs Director Teresito Bacolcol described the twin earthquakes as a “doublet,” two distinct earthquakes that occurred along a massive trench off the country’s eastern seaboard. There were initial reports of damage to homes, buildings and bridges, one official in Manay said, although the full extent of the damage in the Philippines was not immediately clear. At least seven people were killed, civil defense official Ednar Dayanghirang said in a briefing. The fatalities were reported in towns and cities near the earthquake’s epicenter. The twin quakes were among the strongest in recent years to hit the Philippines, which sits on the Pacific “ ” and experiences more than 800 quakes each year. It came two weeks after the Philippines experienced its in more than a decade with 74 people killed on the central island of Cebu following an offshore quake of magnitude 6.9. A video posted on social media and verified by Reuters showed people in the city of Davao calmly holding on to parked vehicles that rocked from side to side as the ground shook, as metal gates rattled nearby. Richie Diuyen, a disaster official in Manay, said the quake lasted 30 to 40 seconds and damaged some homes and the facade of a church, while leaving cracked roads and unpassable bridges. “We couldn’t stand earlier. I am 46 years old now, and this is the strongest earthquake I ever felt,” Diuyen said by phone. Earlier, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said authorities were assessing the situation and search-and-rescue teams would fan out once it was safe. “We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” he said in a statement. Phivolcs warned of aftershocks and urged people in affected areas to stay away from the shoreline. Verified footage from the southern Philippines showed workers filing out of buildings to gather in the streets, lamps swaying in shops, and offices with toppled cabinets and workers holding on to desks as structures and fittings around them creaked. Video images from Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi showed fishing boats returning from sea and children playing on a beach from which water had receded. Phivolcs revised down the magnitude to 7.4 from an initial figure of 7.6, and put the quake’s depth at 23 km (14 miles). The second quake was also downwardly revised to 6.8 from 6.9, with a depth of 37 km (23 miles). The governor of Davao del Norte in the Philippines said people panicked when the earthquake struck. “Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told broadcaster DZMM. “It was very strong.”", "tags": ["toll", "death", "quake", "philippines", "warnings", "rises", "tsunami"]},
{"content": "Protesters both for and against Ecuador’s President rallied in the capital Quito on Sunday after a state of emergency took effect in 10 provinces. Anti-government demonstrations began two weeks ago, organized by the country’s largest Indigenous group, in response to the removal of a fuel subsidy that raised diesel prices from $1.80 to $2.80 per gallon. “Diesel goes up, everything goes up,” and “Out with Noboa” were among the slogans shouted by dozens of protesters at a popular park in the capital, where pro-government supporters also gathered in higher numbers. No incidents were reported. Late Saturday, the government declared a state of emergency starting Sunday at midnight in 10 provinces, citing “serious internal unrest.” The provinces are areas with large Indigenous populations where protests have been concentrated. The order restricts freedom of assembly but does not prohibit peaceful demonstrations. A violent clash between police and Indigenous protesters a week ago left one civilian dead and several injured. Nearly 100 people were detained, and some military personnel were briefly held before being released. On Sunday, protesters demanded the release of detainees, including 13 people accused by prosecutors of terrorism. Pro-government activities included an art fair in El Arbolito Park attended by ministers and other officials, all under the protection of police and military forces. Minister of Government Zaida Rovira told reporters that Ecuador “has grown tired of violence.” Edgar Lama, president of the Social Security Board, said, “There is nothing to discuss with a minority that seeks to impose its will through violence.” Noboa has said he will not reverse the fuel subsidy cut. “Those who choose violence will face the law.

Minutes later, explosives were dropped by a motorised paraglider, also known as a paramotor. “I was thrown away,” said the protester, asking not to be named for fear of retribution from the junta. “Initially, I thought the whole lower part of my body had been severed. I touched it and I realized the legs are still there.” At least 20 people were killed in the attack by the junta, according to the eyewitness, Amnesty International, the shadow National Unity Government and an armed resistance group in the area. It is also the latest instance of Myanmar’s well-armed military using paramotors as part of its widening range of aerial weaponry, including aircraft and drones, deployed in an expanding civil war. A spokesperson for Myanmar’s junta did not respond to calls seeking comment. The military has previously rejected accusations that it targets civilians. The Southeast Asian nation has been gripped by protests and a nationwide armed rebellion since 2021 following the of an elected civilian government. The attack at Sagaing’s Chaung-U township took place just before 8 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. ET) on Monday as local residents gathered in a field, said the eyewitness and a spokesman for a local anti-junta armed resistance group. “The military has used paramotors to bomb this area approximately six times before this latest incident,” Ko Thant, an information officer for the Chaung-U Township People’s Defence Force, told Reuters. The junta’s first recorded use of paramotors, which can seat up to three soldiers to drop bombs or fire at targets, was in December 2024 and they have since been deployed more widely, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. The military also used paramotors to carry out attacks in parts of Myanmar hit by a in March, the United Nations said in April. “Paramotors are typically deployed in areas of mixed control or where resistance groups have minimal equipment, such as lacking access to the 7.62 cartridges and weapons required to shoot them down,” ACLED Senior Analyst Su Mon said in a July report.

{"content": "One year on from her inauguration as Mexico’s first female president, still commands the sort of popular support many leaders can only wish for. Roughly of her performance, according to an August poll by Buendía & Márquez for the newspaper El Universal. Although that’s down from 80% in February, it’s still a sharp contrast to US President Donald Trump, whose rating is hovering just over 40% eight months into his second term, according to a . So, what’s the key to Sheinbaum’s success? suggest one of her most popular achievements has been the expansion of social support programs for millions of citizens, including seniors, students, single mothers and women in general. These are in part a continuation of the policies that made her predecessor and mentor, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, so popular and reflect the slogan that swept him into power: “For the good of all, first the poor.” Sheinbaum was elected Mexico’s first female president in June, with around , partly on the back of her promise to continue the legacy of Lopez Obrador. But since coming to power she has done more than simply follow his agenda. Analysts point to three other areas that have generated praise for Sheinbaum: her handling of relations with the United States and Trump; her fight against corruption; and the looming soccer World Cup. The Mexican leader has won many plaudits for her measured approach to the US president, including her mantra of keeping a “ .” While Trump has upped the pressure on her with orders that included as the Gulf of America and declaring drug cartels as terrorist organizations – an act that could pave the way for using American military force on Mexican soil – Sheinbaum has trodden a diplomatic line between cooperating on security and migration while also demanding respect for . Though she has delivered on many of Trump’s demands, such as boosting the number of troops at the US border to deter drug trafficking, receiving thousands of deported migrants from the US, and extraditing dozens of alleged cartel members wanted by the American government, she has also stood strong in the face of his rhetoric. During a speech Sunday at the iconic El Zócalo square in Mexico City, in which Sheinbaum highlighted a reduction in crime as being among the most important achievements of her first year, she also noted, pointedly, that “Mexico does not accept interference, does not accept interventionism – we are a free, independent and sovereign country.” Treading that fine line, experts say, has not only helped her international standing, but has also helped her tackle some of the many security problems that have plagued the country for decades. In Sheinbaum’s first year, the rate of several high-impact crimes fell sharply, according to official figures. During the first 11 months of Sheinbaum’s term, 23,917 intentional homicides were recorded in Mexico, down from 31,801 during the first 11 months of López Obrador. That’s not to say Sheinbaum doesn’t face challenges in this area. That fall in crime has not been even across the entire country. In the northwestern state of Sinaloa, intentional homicides increased by 400% in the year following the arrest of drug trafficker Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada in July 2024, which triggered clashes between cartel factions that federal security forces have so far been unable to contain. Moreover, roughly 63.2% of Mexicans say they feel unsafe in their city, according to a report by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. And most Mexicans believe that security issues are still the country’s top problem, according to multiple surveys. Another area where Sheinbaum has won support is her fight against corruption, particularly the targeting of officials linked to fuel theft, which is a major problem in the country. Known in Mexico as “fiscal huachicol,” the theft of gasoline and diesel for illegal profit has become a growing source of revenue for criminal groups and is sometimes fueled by government corruption. In early September, Secretary of Security Omar García Harfuch announced that authorities had allegedly involved in a large-scale fuel smuggling scheme. Among those arrested were marines, former customs officials and businessmen. This crackdown is considered a significant development in Sheinbaum’s campaign against corruption and has won the support of 70% of Mexicans, according to a for El País newspaper and W Radio, even though many experts liken progress so far to a drop in the ocean. While those issues have dominated Sheinbaum’s first year in office, the issue that looks likeliest to dominate her second year is Mexico’s co-hosting of the 2026 soccer World Cup with the United States and Canada. This will be the third time Mexico has hosted a World Cup – it was the sole host in 1970 and 1986 – and on this occasion it will hold 13 games, including the opening match on June 11. Both the government and the private sector see an opportunity to attract tourists and income, but they recognize that the country must prepare its infrastructure to receive the visitors who will arrive in the three cities with World Cup stadiums: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. There are some other potential pitfalls, too. Some residents of Mexico City wonder if the capital will have the capacity to host the tournament, after this summer saw historic rains that caused multiple floods, collapsed roadways, and affected the operation of the Metro, the city’s main public transportation network. In addition, some anti-gentrification groups have held protests to reject the works related to the World Cup. Sheinbaum herself has identified the tournament as “a showcase for Mexico,” and will likely receive a further boost to her popularity if she can pull it off smoothly. This is the first time in history that the tournament is being hosted by three separate countries. Luckily for Sheinbaum, given her skill in handling Trump, she already has a head start when it comes to cooperating with Mexico’s co-hosts.", "tags": ["year", "mexico", "popular", "president", "cup", "cool", "head", "world"]},
{"content": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he has secured “$17 trillion” in investment this year – or even more than that. “We have over $17 trillion being invested now in the United States,” Trump at the White House on Tuesday. He added moments later, “We have more than $17 trillion in eight months.” On Friday, he he thought the figure had “just cracked $18 trillion.” But even the $17 trillion figure is fictional. Trump’s own values the “major investment announcements” this term at “$8.8 trillion,” around half the “$17 trillion” and “$18 trillion” numbers Trump used out loud this week. And an item-by-item CNN review of the top 10 items on the White House’s list shows that even the “$8.8 trillion” number is itself a big exaggeration. The White House list doesn’t show that $8.8 trillion is “being invested now in the United States” or even that there have been $8.8 trillion in credible Trump-era commitments to make eventual investments in the US. Rather, the White House list includes: The White House declined to comment on why the president keeps saying he has gotten “$17 trillion” in investment instead of the White House’s own “$8.8 trillion” figure, and it would not comment on the record to address CNN’s specific questions about the many holes in the “$8.8 trillion” figure. Instead, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in an email that the media is doing “pointless and pedantic nitpicking” and said, “The President is right: industry leaders have committed to investing trillions to make and hire in America, with trillions more to come.” He added that the media would be “beclowned” when Trump’s “policies take effect and investment commitments materialize into new factories and facilities.” Here’s a fact check about what the top 10 countries or entities on the White House list have actually committed to – or, more to the point, what they have not. The White House’s list of supposed investment announcements attributes $600 billion to “EU Firms.” But firms in the European Union haven’t invested $600 billion in the US during this Trump presidency – or even made promises to invest $600 billion in the US. Rather, the EU has vaguely signaled that unidentified companies in the EU are interested in investing this much in the US during Trump’s second term. The EU agreed in August to the following language in a with the Trump administration: “European companies are expected to invest an additional $600 billion across strategic sectors in the United States through 2028.” The $600 billion in “expected” private investment may never materialize. , a University of Michigan economics professor, noted in an August interview that “there is no commitment; ‘expected to’ is not a commitment.” Trump has the $600 billion as a “gift” the EU “gave me” to “do anything I want,” but the money has not been handed to him to control, nor handed to anybody at this point. “The European Commission cannot order or decide how private companies invest in the US,” , a Peterson Institute for International Economics nonresident senior fellow who formerly served as European commissioner for trade, said in an email. “The figure given was an estimation of what companies have said they planned to do and invest in the coming years. It is not a legal commitment, and it would be a bit risky to include the figure in a budget or a forecast.” The White House’s announcements list attributes $600 billion in supposed “foreign investment” to Saudi Arabia. But Saudi Arabia has publicly described the $600 billion not as “investment” but as an “intention” to engage in some unspecified combination of “ ” over four years. Experts say a $600 billion Saudi in the US over four years appears unlikely. “The economic and financial relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia will deepen under the Trump presidency, but the numbers given for potential future Saudi trade and investment with the United States look too high,” , a former International Monetary Fund official who is now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute think tank, said in an email. “If it is to occur during this presidency, the $150 billion per year average this implies is equivalent to 14% of Saudi Arabia’s annual gross domestic product, 40% of its annual export revenue, and just over 50% of its annual imports of goods and services,” Callen said. Referring to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, he added, “It is also equivalent to about two-thirds of the assets held by the Public Investment Fund, but the PIF has recently that it aims to have 80% of its portfolio invested in Saudi Arabia.” Maya Senussi, lead economist at advisory firm Oxford Economics, that if global energy prices don’t increase, the Saudi commitment to making domestic investments “could restrict its ability to fulfil” pledges of overseas investment within the next four years. Callen also noted that Saudi Arabia to fulfilling what Trump has claimed was a Saudi pledge during his first term to buy $450 billion in American goods. The White House’s announcements list includes $500 billion in supposed “foreign investment” from India. But India has not actually made any promise to invest $500 billion in the US. Rather, an from Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February confirmed that the $500 billion figure is a goal “aiming to more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.” In other words, the goal would be met in part by Indian companies exporting more to Americans. And even if it was largely met by American companies exporting more to Indians, that would not be the same as India making an “investment” in the US. The White House’s online list does say the “focus” of the $500 billion Indian “investment” is “mutual trade expansion.” Still, it’s inaccurate to describe the $500 billion figure as an Indian investment pledge at all. “I would not include $500 billion on an investment chart,” , the chair on India and emerging Asia economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said in an email. Rossow said “it is hard to imagine a jump to $500 billion” from the current level of Indian investment in the US. (A non-comprehensive 2023 survey from an Indian industry group about $40 billion in cumulative investment in the US from the Indian companies that responded.) The second-biggest item on the White House’s announcements list is $1.2 trillion in “foreign investment” from Qatar. But when the White House announced its deal with Qatar in May, it , “President Donald J. Trump signed an agreement with Qatar to generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion.” The phrase “economic exchange” is vague enough to include two-way trade and US investment in Qatar rather than only Qatari investment in the US. The chief executive of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund that the fund planned to make $500 billion in additional US investments over the next decade. But Diego Lopez, managing director of Global SWF, which researches sovereign wealth funds, said that figure is “unrealistic” based on his organization’s estimates of the Qatari fund’s current investments ($524 billion in assets under management, with about $105 billion of that invested in the US). Even if the fund did manage to invest $500 billion in the US, it’s unclear where the other $700 billion in Qatari investments needed to get to the “$1.2 trillion” figure would come from; Lopez said that “most of the sovereign wealth and firepower in Qatar” is held by the fund. The biggest item on the White House’s announcements list is $1.4 trillion in “foreign investment” from the United Arab Emirates. While UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan did in May that the country had a plan to invest $1.4 trillion in key sectors “over the next 10 years,” neither the UAE nor the Trump administration have explained how the UAE would invest that much in the US. The $1.4 trillion figure is well over double , and a document published by the White House in May the UAE had just $35 billion in total foreign direct investment in the US as of 2023. That May document claimed that Trump “announced over $200 billion in commercial deals” during a visit to Abu Dhabi that month, but the list includes UAE product purchases and American companies’ investments in the UAE rather than only UAE investments in the US. Even if they were all investments, there would still be a massive leap needed to reach $1.4 trillion. The White House’s announcements list credits Japan with $1 trillion in “foreign investment.” But the Japanese government hasn’t pledged nearly that much new investment. Rather, Japan’s prime minister at the time that Japanese companies would bring their level of investment in the US $1 trillion – from an existing level of . In July, Japan agreed to invest $550 billion in the US . The money is supposed to be invested in specific key industries, including semiconductors, shipbuilding, energy, pharmaceuticals, metals and minerals. A memorandum of understanding between the US and Japan says Japan has the right to decline to invest in an opportunity that was selected by Trump after a recommendation from a US investment committee, but if Japan doesn’t quickly provide the funding, Trump . That’s a lot more detail than the statements from other countries and entities on the White House list, but there are still a bunch of key details left to be worked out. , director of the Center for Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution think tank, noted that Japan’s top trade negotiator Japan’s position is that just 1% to 2% of the $550 billion will be actual equity investment, with the rest in loans and loan guarantees. And Solis said “many Japanese companies are in a wait-and-see attitude,” wondering how the US-led investment initiative will operate. Regardless, Solis said, the $1 trillion figure listed by the White House “seems extremely high to me,” adding, “I’m scratching my head, let me put it that way.” The White House’s announcements list includes $450 billion in “foreign investment” from South Korea. But South Korea has actually to invest $350 billion, in some form still to be determined, and negotiations over that smaller sum have run into difficulties. The White House’s “$450 billion” figure appears to include a South Korean pledge to purchase $100 billion in US energy products during Trump’s tenure. But aside from the fact that product purchases are not investments, a South Korean official told The Chosun Daily newspaper that this commitment is not to buy an $100 billion in US energy products but to get to a of $100 billion – so a total of roughly $25 billion a year, up incrementally from a 2024 figure the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis . Other analysts use higher or lower 2024 figures, but they agree that the South Korean commitment is for an incremental increase. In addition, the specifics of the $350 billion in supposed investment . Following an August meeting between Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, “the United States added a few demands that we found difficult to accept,” Foreign Minister Cho Hyun the JoongAng Daily newspaper in early October. Trump in September that the $350 billion from South Korea would be “up front,” but a senior South Korean official responded on domestic television that this is “objectively and realistically not a level we are able to handle,” Reuters . The Korea Herald this week that South Korea is pushing to make heavy use of “loans and guarantees from state-run financial institutions” in the package, while the US “is pushing for a higher proportion of direct cash investment and wants control over project selection.” Negotiations are ongoing, but they have been complicated by in political and economic relations caused by a US immigration raid in September that ensnared hundreds of South Korean workers at a Georgia factory ​being built for two South Korean corporate titans, Hyundai and LG. Lee that current US immigration policies affecting Korean workers will make his country’s companies “very hesitant to make direct investments in the United States.” , Korea chair and president of the geopolitics and foreign policy department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a forthcoming article he provided to CNN that the promised $350 billion investment fund is “in trouble,” citing the immigration raid and financial sticking points. “Koreans, already angered over the images of their countrymen in shackles in ICE detention facilities, may play hard ball and continue to withhold their massive investment commitments,” Cha wrote. He noted it’s also possible the two sides find creative “workarounds” in the negotiations, but it’s clear there is, at least, considerable uncertainty about the future of the promised $350 billion sum. The White House list includes numerous investment pledges from corporations. The biggest is . Tied for the second-biggest are Nvidia and a from Softbank, OpenAI and Oracle. There is an AI investment boom underway, and there is no telling how big it will be. But there is also a long history of splashy corporate investment announcements not coming to fruition, including . Expert observers have expressed caution about the pledges made this year – saying it’s likely the figures include normal spending and previously approved investments. “Even the largest companies” like Apple and Nvidia “can’t realistically commit to an incremental spend of $500 billion over any reasonable timeframe,” , managing director and head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, said in an email. “What they would most likely count in those numbers is their current spend in the US, as well as other spend they expect from their vendors, partners and customers. Even then, these numbers are more likely a statement of support for the administration more than a firm commitment of capital.” Similarly, , portfolio manager at investment firm Gabelli, wrote in emailed commentary about Apple’s announcement: “The $600 billion will be spread out over several years and includes multiple areas of investment, from facilities to personnel to input costs, most of which was already reflected in Apple’s long-range financial planning.” Belton added: “For context, they unveiled a $ , so a program of this magnitude is not out of the ordinary.”", "tags": ["fiction", "investment", "trump", "figure", "fact"]},
{"content": "Argentine President Javier Milei took to the stage Monday night in Buenos Aires for a book launch-turned-rock concert, a move that delighted his fans but drew criticism from opposition members who accused him of being out of touch with the country’s economic problems. Surrounded by a crowd of 15,000 that included political allies and young supporters, Milei swapped his trademark chainsaw for a microphone as he sought to energize his base ahead of the October 26 legislative elections and put behind him a controversy surrounding the resignation of one of the ruling party’s big-name candidates. José Luis Espert was running for a seat in Argentina’s lower house of Congress representing Buenos Aires province, a key region for the ruling “La Libertad Avanza” (Freedom Advances) party. He stepped down on Sunday amid allegations that he received a payment from a drug-trafficker, but has denied any wrongdoing. Milei made no explicit mention of the controversy while on stage, but he did physically embrace Diego Santilli, who has stepped in to replace Espert on the campaign trail. What was billed as the launch of Milei’s latest book, “The Construction of the Miracle,” morphed into a musical spectacle broadcast live on state TV that included members of Milei’s ruling coalition performing nine rock covers. Milei, a far-right libertarian, performed songs like Charly García’s “Demoliendo Hoteles” and Nino Bravo’s “Libre,” tracks associated with resistance against oppression, referencing the last military dictatorship in Argentina and the Franco dictatorship in Spain. The spectacle drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders, who accused the president of being out of touch with Argentina’s mounting economic hardships. Argentina, which is facing inflation and has in recent weeks experienced currency volatility, has been struggling to accumulate dollar reserves necessary to meet upcoming debt payments The fragility of the country’s economy recently prompted the Trump administration to announce a new financial assistance package and Milei is set to meet US President Donald Trump, whom he has often praised, in Washington on October 14 to discuss the plan. Buenos Aires governor Axel Kicillof accused Milei of “living in another reality.” “Perhaps during his time as a candidate, Milei could do these things, but now I find it very serious … They should be taking responsibility and dealing with what’s happening to business owners,” he told the Argentine television station C5N. Others were harsher. “Come back to planet Earth, president,” Ricardo López Murphy, a member of the chamber of deputies for the United Republicans, wrote on X. “Our country needs you here. These images give a mix of secondhand embarrassment, anger, and pain.” Former economy minister Martín Lousteau posted, “One day of work lost, and the only Argentine miracle is performed by the millions of families who work magic just to make it to the end of the month.” The president, whose party suffered a significant electoral defeat in Buenos Aires in September, rallied his supporters and took aim at the opposition: “You may have won one round, but you haven’t won the battle yet, much less the war.” Milei closed the night by shedding his leather jacket for a suit and tie, promising sweeping “structural reforms” after December 10 if his party can expand its power in Congress. The ruling party hopes to win seats in the October 26 elections to push forward its economic plans without requiring votes from allies.", "tags": ["argentina", "resistance", "vote", "turmoil", "songs", "party", "milei", "rocks"]},

Mthethwa, 58, began serving as South Africa’s envoy to France in December 2023 – his latest role in a series of high-profile portfolios that included stints as police minister, as well as the minister of sports, arts and culture. As a young man, Mthethwa campaigned against apartheid, a racist policy that kept Blacks and Whites apart, and grew through the ranks of the African National Congress (ANC) party, which fought for democratic rule in South Africa.

{"content": "Over the next five years, New York City will welcome two new momentous spaces for the arts, both along Manhattan’s iconic Fifth Avenue, some 40 blocks apart. The first is an airy for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s modern and contemporary collection on the Upper East Side; the second is a new home for the groundbreaking National Black Theatre (NBT) in Harlem. Both of these undertakings are led by the same architect, who, until now, had never completed a building for a cultural institution of this scale — nor had she even designed a major project in New York. Frida Escobedo’s tandem commissions reflect the barrier-breaking superlatives she is now accruing. In a profession that often skews older and male, the 45-year-old Mexico City-born architect’s achievements have often been prefixed by “the youngest,” the first” or a combination of the two. Her project with the Met, for instance, makes her the first female architect to design a wing in the storied museum’s 155-year history. Escobedo has always forged her own path. Eschewing tradition, she opened her own eponymous studio in 2006 without having worked her way up through larger architectural firms or under the guidance of a celebrated “starchitect.” Her early projects included a juried commission for Mexico City’s Museo Experimental El Eco, where a series of movable concrete blocks in the museum’s courtyard can be built up or rearranged depending on the program, and the Plaza Cívica, a tilted round stage in the center of a busy plaza in Lisbon, for the Portuguese capital’s architectural triennial, that invited public interaction. Escobedo’s breakout moment arrived in 2018, when she was selected to design , one of architecture’s most prestigious commissions, in London. There she constructed a dark, porous structure of stacked “celosia” walls, typical of Mexican buildings, that cast deep shadows with the rising and setting sun. The architect’s practice is, she said, “changing constantly” as she works across scales and mediums — a series of Aesop retail stores, temporary sculptural museum installations or tranquil hospitality projects around Mexico. For Escobedo, architecture is a language through which she understands the world. With each new project, she refines her sense of minimalism with an elegant touch, often playing with form and materials that foster a sense of openness, tranquility and mutability. “What I’ve learned is that I want to become very good at doing things for the first time. It’s about staying curious and engaged and not seeing it as something that you have complete knowledge of,” Escobedo said in a video call. “Even if you’re repeating a certain typology, see it with fresh eyes.” At the Met, Escobedo took the unusual step of fully embedding herself by setting up an office in the museum and working there for a year as she collaborated closely with its staff. In 2030, when the Tang Wing for Modern and Contemporary Art is due to open, the five-floor building with two sweeping terraces and latticed facade, all of which face the greenery of Central Park, will give a sense of atmosphere and reverence to a portion of the museum that, architecturally, has always felt like an afterthought. For David Breslin, the Met’s curator in charge for modern and contemporary art, Escobedo’s limited experience with large-scale buildings was not an issue. “People ask: ‘What’s it like working with an architect on their biggest project?’ And I say, ‘Well, it would probably be the biggest project for almost any architect that we chose,’” he said. “It just so happens that Frida is younger and earlier in her career than some others. But for whomever, this would have been .” Breslin believes the museum has benefitted from working with an architect who is experimental and open, even without a CV full of similar projects. “Artists love her, and artists are, a lot of the time, her first collaborators. I think she brings that same sense of real inquiry,” Breslin said. “I think the best artists are the ones who also refuse a signature style, who are open to having their minds changed. And I think she brings that artist’s mind, as well, to her idea of what design and architecture can be. “We’re really building something for the future — and so we want to open up possibilities and not close them down,” he added. Many parts of the Met have been in flux lately as the museum looks to the future, refreshing its galleries for European paintings; building a for African, Ancient American and Oceanic art; and providing a more central location for the blockbuster Costume Institute exhibitions that inspire the Met Gala each year. Escobedo’s task is to elevate and showcase the Met’s collection of 20th- and 21st-century art, which has long been underrepresented among the museum’s vast encyclopedic holdings and within its maze-like halls. The museum recently received a substantial gift of 188 artworks by leading surrealist and Dada figures, including Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray and Max Ernst, and has been adding contemporary additions from artists like Kerry James Marshall and Nicole Eisenman, Breslin said. “We’re at the crossroads of many different collections,” Escobedo said of the new wing. “There’s this wonderful thing about the fluidity of the Met — you go from one wing to the other without even noticing it.” Visitors might wander from the Arms and Armor section to the American Wing, then find themselves gazing up at the Egyptian Temple of Dendur, letting serendipity guide them. The Tang Wing, a collaboration with the architecture firm Beyer Blinder Belle, will also house rotating special exhibitions, requiring blank canvases of sorts. But Escobedo is rethinking what it means for a space to be versatile. “It’s common to think about flexibility as a very neutral space that could be reprogrammable, something that is flat and that could allow for different divisions of the space,” she explained. “But the way that we have been thinking is almost the opposite. It’s the architectural specificity that allows for future flexibility.” She continued: “The collection holds many different formats — photography, prints, paintings, sculpture, video, installation — and because it’s a contemporary collection, it will be growing, and we don’t know what’s going to happen next. So the idea was that a variation of spaces, a range of scales, and different relations between them, would allow for a more interesting approach on what flexibility could be.” Two miles uptown from the Met, Escobedo approached her design for the building housing the National Black Theatre with the same sense of inquisitiveness. The NBT is one of the longest running Black theaters in the country, exploring and uplifting Black culture through a range of often genre-bending productions. Now partnering with Ray Harlem, a mixed-use residential building, the performing arts space was founded in 1968 by Dr. Barbara Ann Teer as a “temple for liberation” at a time when Harlem was largely abandoned, explained Teer’s daughter, Sade Lythcott, who now helms the NBT. Decades after the Harlem Renaissance, the artistic and cultural movement that transformed the city in the 1920s and 1930s, Teer remained committed to the neighborhood’s reinvestment and renewal. “I told Frida that story, and how Frida responded was by far the most thoughtful, the most balanced and the most radical approach to what this hub of cultural ingenuity needed to be: a monument of Black imagination with a very refined and balanced hand,” Lythcott said in a video call. “She’s a deep listener. And I think architects build these massive structures and ego does get in the way — she just didn’t have any.” Escobedo is collaborating with Marvel Architects, Handel Architects and interior designer Little Wing Lee on the project, and recently completed the residential portion of the 21-story Ray Harlem. The NBT will open in its new permanent space in the tower’s lower floors in 2027, hosting both a 250-seat flexible “temple” and a 99-seat theater within its 27,000 square feet. A group of notable contemporary artists will contribute works to the space, too, including the interdisciplinary artist Sanford Biggers. In the spirit of serving its community, the new theater has been designed to forge a sense of inclusion, according to Lythcott. “We wanted to be explicit about theater having to connect folks together, and — literally — our windows look into our neighbors windows,” Lythcott said, adding that the architecture promotes “this idea of belonging. No matter what view you have in the theater, you feel connected.” Following her conversations with Lythcott, one point of reference Escobedo returned to was the residential stoop, where so many of Harlem’s residents spend their time with their families and neighbors. Stoops directly informed the theater’s private boxes, Lythcott said, but they also guided Escobedo’s thinking around how the space’s interiors could feel permeable to passersby. “We wanted to make it visible, but, of course, it’s a theater, so there needs to be an enclosed space, as well as some opportunities to engage with the street,” Escobedo said. “There’s something really interesting in the streets of New York, particularly in Harlem, where some of the collective spaces happen just at the threshold of private and public.” Escobedo said that when she began her career, she would have “never imagined” having two projects on the same historic avenue in Manhattan. Building her own practice, now with the support of two full studios in Mexico City and New York, has been “really difficult and incredibly challenging,” she said. “I know that it might sound like it’s the opposite, because I had these opportunities when I was very young, but it’s hard. It’s hard to build trust around a practice that has not had previous experience,” she explained. “It’s a balance between being incredibly grateful for all these opportunities and being really surprised every time they happen.”", "tags": ["museum", "architect", "female", "art", "meet", "metropolitan", "history"]},

{"content": "“If we don’t have FREE SPEECH, then we just don’t have a FREE COUNTRY,” then-candidate Donald Trump But less than nine months into his second term, he was explaining his administration’s stance this this way: “We took the freedom of speech away,” he said at a White House event Wednesday as he tried to explain his call to put people who burn the American flag behind bars for years despite a very clear Supreme Court decision that lists flag burning as free speech. Trump’s complete turnabout on speech is indicative of the contradictions and ironies in the bedrock principle of the American liberties in the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment. While Trump came to office promising to restore free speech, particularly on college campuses and on social media, he’s now engaged in a multi-front war over what people can say in the US: ► A Ronald Reagan-appointed judge accused Trump’s administration of a “ ” for targeting and deporting pro-Palestinian academics. ► Conservative Supreme Court justices were skeptical at oral arguments over a Colorado law that bans , suggesting it may step on the free speech rights of therapists. ► Trump wants colleges and universities to in exchange for federal funding. ► He applauded his FCC chairman, , for trying to get Jimmy Kimmel’s show canceled by ABC, an effort that backfired. ► His lawsuits against media companies and law firms, none of which appear to stand on firm legal ground, have nonetheless been wildly successful in and sending a message to firms that would oppose him. ► Companies like YouTube have or made plans to do so for members of his administration, such as FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who were suspended for spreading misinformation during the pandemic. ► His attorney general, Pam Bondi, promised to go after “ ” by people who she perceived as celebrating the death of Charlie Kirk. The hate speech element is particularly concerning to experts because in recent decades, it has become a tenet of Supreme Court cases and free speech advocates that “hate speech” is such a nebulous term that leaving it unprotected would invite exactly the type of selective viewpoint-policing that the administration now stands accused of. The hate speech in question was not any obviously repugnant White supremacist or racist ideology, but rather comments related to Kirk’s death, potentially including those who celebrated it. But we don’t really know since Bondi has not been specific. US history is full of pendulum swings back and forth between freedom and restriction of speech. The First Amendment, adopted shortly after the Constitution, guarantees Congress shall make no law “abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” But within a few years, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which made it a crime to criticize the president, then John Adams, during the undeclared Quasi War between the US and France. “The sad truth is, free speech has always been a weaponized slogan, right from the outset, when it’s first invented in the early 18th century,” according to Fara Dabhoiwala, a historian at Princeton University and author of the recent book Benjamin Franklin’s grandson was among those arrested for “libeling” Adams under the law. Federalists also threw a Vermont publisher and congressman, , in jail for criticizing Adams in print. (Among other things, Lyon wrote that Adams had “an unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp,” and, separately, over Adams’ foreign policy. Lyon, attacked with a cane after he spat tobacco juice at a fellow lawmaker, defended himself with fire tongs.) Far from silencing Lyon, however, the Sedition Act backfired. Lyon ran a successful campaign for Congress from jail. The unpopularity of the clampdown on speech helped lead to Adams’ defeat in the election of 1800. Another wartime restriction on speech, the Sedition Act of 1918, led to the conviction and sentencing to 10 years in prison of the socialist Eugene Debs for his criticism of the draft during World War I. The Supreme Court upheld his conviction, but Debs ran a presidential campaign from his jail cell in 1920 and got nearly 1 million votes. President Warren G. Harding later commuted Debs’ sentence. Courts and people have complex and nuanced views on free speech. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the unanimous majority opinion upholding Debs’ conviction, but he also wrote a key dissent in a case involving the conviction of Russian immigrants who distributed leaflets calling for a general strike in the US to interrupt the war effort. In that 1919 dissent, he espoused what would become a more absolutist view of the benefits of free speech. “The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,” he In the US, the evolution of speech has also turned on issues of race. “If you go to the 1830s you would see that abolitionism was brutally suppressed in many Southern states,” according to Jacob Mchangama, executive director at the Future of Free Speech, a think tank at Vanderbilt University and a Senior Fellow with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. “You would face jail if you spread abolitionist writings, so that was an attempt to try and contain abolitionists in the North from spreading their ideas to the South,” he told me in a phone interview. Generations later, it was the civil rights movement that helped secure more and more protections for speech. “The steady expansion of the First Amendment was to a very large extent accomplished by civil rights groups; you had the NAACP and Jewish organizations who were persuaded that adopting laws against group libel, as hate speech was often called, was detrimental to minorities,” Mchangama said. Those protections have also helped protect the type of hateful speech that civil rights groups would abhor. Thurgood Marshall argued in favor of school desegregation at the Supreme Court as an NAACP lawyer in the Brown v. Board of Education case. Later, as a Supreme Court justice, he ruled against an Ohio law right to free speech. It’s an important distinction between the US and much of the rest of the world, where laws are more likely to restrict speech. Mchangama points to people in European countries who have been jailed over Facebook posts, for instance. Those cases are why Trump and Vice President JD Vance have both sought to lecture European countries about free speech — lectures that have not aged well as the Trump administration now tries to clamp down on dissent on college campuses and on television, among other places. Dabhoiwala fears the US is entering a disturbing new period where speech is in danger. Protections we enjoy today, he said, come out of the Red Scares of the late 1910s and the 1950s, “when government was trying to shut down socialist and communist speech and the speech of homosexuals and the speech of other kind of progressives.” “And yet what we’re seeing is really a third Red Scare where once again, we have an authoritarian government trying to shut down political voices that it disagrees with,” Dabhoiwala said. The larger issue may be what Dabhoiwala sees as a major flaw in the First Amendment, which protects speech from the government but is narrowly drawn. “The government may not censor you, but any private corporation can sack people for putting a bumper sticker on their car or for posting something online, and that’s that,” he said. To that point, Kimmel was put back on the air not because of a definitive government action, but because ABC’s parent company, Disney, made a business decision. ABC needs its broadcast licenses, although fewer and fewer people watch TV over the air. Tech companies jealously guard their exemption from liability for what’s posted on their platforms, a relic of telecommunications law that was passed in the 1990s before the Internet was much of a thing. If you’ve heard the term “ ,” that’s what people are talking about. “We’re in such a mess because these providers don’t have any legal responsibility to the truth or to the common good, and they are happily monetizing and making giant amounts of profit out of spreading lies and untruths alongside truth and deliberation of a serious kind,” Dabhoiwala said. Mchangama agrees that untruths can spread quickly online, but he thinks the effects can be blown out of proportion and would be impossible to stop through content moderation. “If you believe that everyone with an internet connection should be able to participate in the public sphere, then I think it’s impossible to try and combat mis- and disinformation through content moderation, because what constitutes mis- and disinformation is often very difficult to determine,” he said. Dabhoiwala sees things differently. He wants more out of social media platforms because misinformation spreads quickly, but fact checking takes time. “The moment we say this is all just the same and free speech, say what you like, you open the door to vast quantities of misinformation, to manipulation by hostile outside actors, by politicians just bullshitting their way to power,” he said. Mchangama, on the other hand, hopes the American left will look at the Trump administration today and dial back on efforts to control speech. “Power changes hands,” Mchangama said. New leaders have new ideas about which groups are worthy of protection, and which should be targeted, which is what we’re seeing right now with Trump.", "tags": ["backflip", "speech", "trump", "free", "years"]},

In remarks Friday evening, Trump confirmed he spoke with Machado, adding that she was “very nice” in their call. “The person who actually got the Nobel Prize called today, called me and said, ‘I’m accepting this in honor of you, because you really deserved it,’” the president said. “A very nice thing to do. I didn’t, I didn’t say, ‘Then give it to me,’ though I think she might have. She was very nice,” Trump joked. “I’ve been helping her along the way,” Trump added. “They need a lot of help in Venezuela, it’s a basic disaster. So, and you could also say it was given out for ’24 and I was running for office in ‘24.” Shortly after the Nobel Prize announcement, the administration reacted negatively. “The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace,” White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a post on social media. Machado won the award after years of efforts to promote democracy and has described her life’s work as promoting “ballots over bullets.” She was driven into hiding in Venezuela amid a sharp crackdown on dissent by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Many in the Trump administration had previously praised Machado’s work. The administration has also repeatedly denounced Maduro and has deployed a substantial military presence to the region to combat “narcotrafficking” – a campaign that many see as an attempt to weaken and potentially drive the Venezuelan leader from power. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was among a group of lawmakers, including now US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz, who nominated Machado for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2024. “In our work as policymakers who strive for democracy and human rights in the  face of dictatorial regimes in the Western Hemisphere and beyond, we have rarely witnessed such courage, selflessness, and firm grasp of morality as we have in María Corina Machado,” they wrote in a letter in November 2024. “It is our firm belief that María Corina Machado’s courageous and selfless leadership, and unyielding dedication to the pursuit of peace and democratic ideals, make her a most deserving candidate for this prestigious award,” the group of Florida lawmakers wrote. In April, Rubio called her “the personification of resilience, tenacity, and patriotism,” someone who “has never backed down from her mission of fighting for a free, fair, and democratic Venezuela.” Trump himself, before his inauguration in January, said she was a freedom fighter who “MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE!” Machado on Friday dedicated her Nobel Prize “to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!” However, there were no warm words from the president’s allies after her win and the perceived snubbing of Trump. Richard Grenell, Trump’s envoy for Venezuela, declared the “Nobel Prize died years ago.” Benjamin Gedan, the Venezuelan director at the National Security Council under the Obama administration, said it appeared the Nobel Committee was sending a message to both the United States and the Venezuelan opposition in its choice to award Machado the prize. “The White House has been sending signals that it might use military force to topple this regime, and that it has the support of Maria Corina to do so,” Gedan told CNN. “It seems to me that the Nobel Committee would prefer that both the United States and the Venezuelan opposition continue to fight peacefully for change.” “I think the US reaction might reflect both things – frustration that Trump wasn’t chosen but also discomfort with this critique of US policy in the Caribbean,” he said. Although Trump did not speak publicly about Machado’s win until early Friday evening, he had, however, thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin hours earlier. “There have been cases where the committee has awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to people who have done nothing for peace,” Putin said in remarks in Tajikistan Friday. “Whether the current US president deserves the Nobel Prize or not, I don’t know. But he’s really doing a lot to resolve complex crises that last for years, even decades,” he said. “Thank you to President Putin!” Trump wrote in on Truth social, following Friday’s announcement, which included a clip of the Russian President who has perpetuated an ongoing war against Ukraine and has defied Trump’s own efforts to bring that conflict to an end.", "tags": ["peace", "machado", "trump", "prize", "administration", "award", "winner", "decision", "nobel"]},

{"content": "In Luca Guadagnino’s new psychological thriller “After the Hunt,” Julia Roberts stars as a Yale professor who is forced to choose sides when a star pupil accuses another faculty member of sexual assault. Each scene that unfolds is thorny and tense. And as the cast — including Ayo Edebiri and Andrew Garfield who play the accuser and the accused, respectively — engage in an unflinching battle of wits, navigating one knotty maneuver after another, what stands out is their clothes, which are as sharp as the dialogue. “After the Hunt” brings Guadagnino into more volatile territory as a filmmaker, but it has similarities to his past work in the visually rich sartorial choices of its cast, where the clothes contain deeper meaning and expresses the power dynamics between its characters. The result is made possible by the film’s costume designer Giulia Piersanti. Whether teaching a class at the pristine Ivy League institution or grabbing a drink at a bar after hours, Roberts’ character Alma Imhoff has an unmistakable penchant for preppy, tailored cream-colored pieces, achieved with a wardrobe of luxury labels like The Row, Celine and Lemaire, though she also occasionally opts for vintage Ralph Lauren and L.L. Bean. And her style is mimicked throughout by Edibiri’s character Maggie Price (who wears clothes by young British designer Grace Wales Bonner, which is just as classy but not at the same extortionate price point). It is through these subtleties that viewers can deduce she has a yearning for Alma’s approval, and possibly more. “I wanted to play around with the idea of the same type of looks but worn by different personalities and therefore with different styling and proportions,” said Piersanti in an interview with CNN in August from the Venice Film Festival, where the film premiered. “If you notice the women in the film, they all wear very similar items: blazers, button downs, it’s very academic. But Alma is the chicer contemporary version, while Maggie, who emulates Alma, wears a younger version of her looks.” Piersanti was born in Rome but moved to Paris with her mother and sister, when she was seven. She relocated again, as a teen to Los Angeles for a few years, and then to New York to study at Parsons’ Design School of Fashion. When she turned 20 in the ’90s, she was offered the opportunity to work at  Miu Miu, so she packed her bags and headed to Milan. Piersanti, who today lives between Milan and the Italian capital, found herself gravitating towards knitwear and decided to specialize in the craft, subsequently taking on design responsibilities at Paris-based labels Balenciaga, Lanvin, and Alaïa. Today, she works as the head of knitwear across womenswear and menswear for Celine, the French house owned by the world’s biggest luxury group LVMH, while also continuing her work in costume design. “Most movies stay in the past or the present, to tell a story about a character. Fashion, on the other hand, is about the future.” Giulia Piersanti, the designer behind the costumes for the film, \"After the Hunt,\" and in the knitwear department at French luxury label Celine “Being a fashion designer was my dream ever since I was young, but costume design is something that I fell into,” Piersanti said. In hindsight, however, perhaps it isn’t too surprising. “When I was a teenager, I loved movies and used to skip class to go to the nearby theater by myself, and with my lunch money I watched film after film,” she said. Piersanti’s professional relationship with Guadagnino stretches back to 2015. After meeting in Milan through mutual friends, the Italian film director approached her to work on “A Bigger Splash,” starring Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes and Dakota Johnson. Impressed by Piersanti’s understanding of complex human social behaviors, Guadagnino felt she was a natural fit for the film’s costume design. But instead of leaping at the opportunity, “I was worried it would be too big of a responsibility,” Piersanti recalled. Back then, she had never worked on a project of that scale, and there was much to be done, but she remembered getting straight to work. “I got stressed out for time, so I started making phone calls and research,” she said. The film turned out to be a critical success, garnering favorable reviews for its visually arresting style rather than just the acting or the plot. The costumes, particularly Swinton’s wardrobe and the pieces designed by Raf Simons during his tenure at Dior, were celebrated as a key element of the artistic narrative and established the movie as a source of style inspiration. Piersanti has since become a go-to collaborator for Guadagnino, working on the costumes for several of his films in the years that followed, including the critically acclaimed “Call Me by Your Name” and gorier “Bones and All” and “Suspiria.” Each project or collection Piersanti works on requires thoughtful consideration as she juggles designing for the big screen and for everyday people — or at least, the customers who buy Celine clothes. “Creating looks for movies and designing for fashion are two very different things,” she stated, observing that while both draw from historical references, “most movies stay in the past or the present, to tell a story about a character. Fashion, on the other hand, is about the future.” Nonetheless, both mediums challenge her creatively, Piersanti said. “They both need empathetic observation to understand people and why they dress in one way or another.” And while Piersanti often experienced “culture shock” due to moving around as a child, it ultimately “opened my mind to different worlds and realities, which has very much fed my work,” she added. Guadagnino’s latest film presents messy characters navigating a 2019 landscape shortly after the rise of the #MeToo movement, which held men accountable for the sexual abuse and exploitation of women, and a time of heightened debate around cancel culture and social justice. Unlike his past projects, there is little exploration of sexuality or love; instead, the focus of the movie is on power dynamics and optics. Piersanti said she used the script as the starting point. Typically, at the beginning of any film’s production, Guadagnino “will talk me through the characters and what he wants to say about them,” she explained. From there, she’ll have carte blanche on the clothes. Piersanti’s process then unfolds through visual research, which she’ll plaster on the walls of the costume department, “so that when the actors come in for fittings, they are surrounded by visuals of what their characters will look like,” she said. Beyond what a person might wear, Piersanti said she thinks about “their psychology” including “what they might like and what music they might listen to.” The goal, she continued, is to ensure the viewer “understands the character without making too obvious choices but still adding personality where the script allows freedom.” For “After the Hunt” in particular, Piersanti watched the 1988 American drama “Another Woman” starring Gena Rowland (who also plays a professor) for inspiration in creating a “higher bourgeoisie mood,” she said. Primarily, Piersanti wanted to convey “upper-class chic,” with a touch of “edge and rigidity.” As she noted: “No soft fabrics, no knitwear, no dresses.” That resulted in much of the cast wearing blazers, trousers and loafers — anything that could create an angular feel. Though, it was a different approach for Alma’s psychologist husband, whose clothing inspiration was “less new England academics,” according to Piersanti, and more in the style of music composer Philip Glass and the late filmmaker David Lynch and “how they wear lightweight Japanese suits with no ties.” It is these finer details that act as a prescient form of non-verbal communication, which excites Piersanti most. Some naysayers may dismiss fashion as frivolous or an unessential part of daily life, but for Piersanti, that couldn’t be further from the truth. “Everyone makes choices, whether consciously or subconsciously, when choosing what they wear or buy,” she said. “To understand that allows me to design for a customer who will buy the garment and for a character in the script.”", "tags": ["outfits", "crisis", "guadagnino", "film", "professor", "julia", "roberts", "designer", "luca"]},

{"content": "“Is it stealing to take back what was stolen?” That’s the question asked in the trailer for “Relooted,” a video game in which players form a crew and plan a heist to reclaim real-life African artifacts held in Western museums. Created by South African game developer Nyamakop, the game, to be released on PC and Xbox, is set in a futuristic Johannesburg, South Africa. The crew is composed of scientists, computer programmers and MMA fighters — rather than seasoned criminals — and guided by the fictitious Professor Grace, a retired South African art historian frustrated by the glacial rate of restitutions. There are hundreds of thousands of African artifacts held in Western collections. As European countries colonized Africa, they took art and valuables. Some, such as the . This collection of thousands of sculptures and plaques once adorned the royal palace in the Kingdom of Benin, in modern day Nigeria, and was taken by British soldiers in 1897. Some African artifacts were acquired through coercion and others were bought. Precise numbers are hard to ascertain, but a 2009 report from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimated that 90-95% of sub-Saharan Africa’s art is held outside of the continent. The impact of their absence has been immense, Chika Okeke-Agulu professor of art history at Princeton University, told CNN. It would be like European civilization “without all the cultural artifacts of Greece, Rome, the Holy Roman Empire, the Renaissance,” he said. While many African artifacts are viewable in museums around the world, traveling there isn’t always a realistic option “These museums are only accessible to the same people for whom they were built,” Okeke-Agulu said, “Americans, Europeans and their peer nations.” The game will feature 70 artifacts to steal, some of which are among the most controversial in the ongoing debate around restitution. While the artifacts are real, the museums are not. The likes of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the British Museum in London are swapped out for cookie-cutter depictions of future Western museums. In the way that Western countries characterized the entirety of Africa as just “mud huts,” Ben Myres, CEO and creative director of Nyamakop said, the developers “wanted to do the same thing back to the West.” Europe, referred to in the game as the Old World, is generically old and stuffy, while the US, called the “Shiny Place,” is a mix of Las Vegas and Times Square. The game is non-violent. Myres said, “We wanted to contrast the very violent way the artifacts were often taken. The way the artifacts are reclaimed is not through brute force and overpowering, but outsmarting the very same systems and institutions which took the artifacts.” The developers are adamant that they do not want the idea of stealing back cultural artifacts taken seriously. Rather, they hope the game can be “reflective of the general frustration around repatriation.” A number of African governments have formally requested the return of cultural artifacts. Legal limits by some governments on their museums, such as the British Museum Act 1963, and French inalienability laws, have stopped some museums from returning items However, progress has been made, and the French senate is due to vote on a law this year that would simplify restitutions. This comes after the French government commissioned a in 2018 into African artifacts held in French public institutions. The report set out a process to return artifacts, though only 30 have been returned to African countries so far, 26 of which were to the West African nation of Benin. In August, , including one thought to be King Toera, a Malagasy king executed by French troops in 1897. The British Museum told CNN in an email that it “understands and recognizes the significance of the issues surrounding the return of objects and works with communities, colleagues, and museums across the globe to share the collection as widely as possible,” adding that its “ambition is to work in partnership with other museums around the world to lend or exchange items.” Alongside the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the British Museum has to Ghana. In 2021, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced . The museum did not respond to a request for comment. Mohale Mashigo, the narrative director of “Relooted,” says the game is “African Futurist,” rather than Afrofuturism as seen in the movie “Black Panther.” Afrofuturism is “this melting pot of all the cultures we can find, whereas African Futurism stays true to the cultures that exist,” she said. The futuristic Johannesburg in the game features landmarks that will be familiar to South Africans, something Myres said is not a common experience for an African gamer. “You don’t get to see Africa in the future very often. It’s almost like Africa is not allowed to dream and be hopeful of what the future looks like.” The success of “Black Panther” showed Myres that they might be able to find an audience amongst the African diaspora and Western gamers, and in doing so, they might also be able to raise awareness of the restitution issue. Okeke-Agulu thinks that video games are a perfect format. Far from trivializing the debate, it makes it accessible. “The producers of Relooted have used this knowledge producing platform to point to this important history and topic that is of relevance to Africans. I’m all in.” The developers hope “Relooted” will encourage Western gamers to take an interest in African history. “The whole game is this invitation to learn,” Myres said. The game doesn’t yet have a launch date, but a demo has been released on Steam.", "tags": ["game", "artifacts", "african", "museums", "western"]},

{"content": "On November 22, 2023, Chantal and Nicky Young closed their front door in London for the final time and boarded a flight to Israel. Family members were waiting at arrivals in Tel Aviv with a sign saying, “Welcome home Grandma and Grandpa.” One person who wasn’t there, however, was the youngest of their five children: Nathanel. The 20-year-old was murdered by Hamas on October 7. Two years previously he’d made Aliyah – the term for Jewish immigration to Israel, which translates as “ascendance” and was serving with the Israel Defense Forces on the Gaza border. “Nathanel’s dream had been for us to make Aliyah. He’d been looking for a property for us,” his French-born mother Chantal told CNN. The Youngs were planning their move when Nathanel was killed. “We were in shock,” said 62-year-old Chantal, who oversaw catering at a Jewish school before she emigrated. “For a long time, I wouldn’t say that my son passed away, I’d say ‘he’s gone on a trip,’ because it was very difficult for me to accept.” Nathanel’s grieving parents soon decided to realize his dream by bringing their move date forward, despite the war. The Youngs are among thousands of Jewish people who have made Aliyah in the two years since the brutal Hamas-led attacks. Some have been motivated by a need to stand in solidarity with Israel, others by a desire to find a refuge from in their home countries. But the flow is not just in one direction. As Jews from around the world have moved to Israel, many Israelis have left the country to settle elsewhere, finding themselves unable to live amid the ongoing conflict, economic challenges and in an increasingly polarized society. The result, according to Sergio DellaPergola, a demographer and emeritus professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem who has spent his career studying migration to and from Israel, is a net migration deficit that speaks to a wider disorientation in the wake of the October 7, 2023 attacks. “Israel has always been fundamentally an immigration country,” he told CNN. But in 2023, official statistics revealed a rarely seen “negative migration balance,” he said of the data from the country’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). About 80,000 Israelis left, with that October alone accounting for 15,000. Around 25,000 have since returned to Israel, while the country welcomed 30,000 new immigrants. The result is a net deficit of 25,000, said DellaPergola. While these may not sound like huge numbers, Israel is a small country with an overall population of just over 10 million, 7.2 million of whom are Jewish, according to DellaPergola. The CBS has just released further data relating to migration to and from Israel up to September 2025, which he says paints a similar picture to 2024. “The worst that could have happened had already happened so I wasn’t scared,” said Chantal of leaving life in Britain for a country at war nearly two years ago. “Every country has its problems and it’s not the perfect country but we feel it’s our country.” Nicky, 65, who worked in customer services for many years, admitted he had been “more apprehensive,” but added: “It’s incredible the support we’ve had as a bereaved family in Israel and we still get right up to now.” Yocheved Ruttenberg, 24, was living in Texas and working in construction sales on October 7 when she heard the news of the attacks. “I just couldn’t function,” she told CNN. “I was like, ‘I need to be in Israel.’” She flew to Israel two weeks later with 23 huge duffel bags of supplies for those affected by the attacks, bought with funds she and a friend had raised. “Three days before my return flight, I called my job and quit,” she said. “I had a whole life in Texas but I couldn’t leave. I saw this huge need to match volunteer opportunities to people around the world. Everybody wanted to help and nobody knew what to do.” Today, Ruttenberg lives in Tel Aviv and runs a thriving organization that has a community of 45,000 people interested in volunteering opportunities in Israel. She still travels back to the United States but says she has noticed a shift in the mood there. “I was very aware that the atmosphere has changed drastically getting off the flight,” she said of a recent trip. “I was wearing a big Star of David on my sweater and was suddenly very aware I wasn’t surrounded by people who support Israel.” Over the centuries, there have been waves of Jewish migration, largely driven by persecution. While the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 might have been regarded as an end to the wandering, some there are now questioning whether the Jewish homeland is the best place for them. In the past two years, thousands of Israelis have opted to relocate to places where air raid sirens, terrorist attacks, mandatory military service and anti-government protests no longer feature in their daily lives. But while many Israeli emigrants have embarked on new lives in Cyprus, Canada and Thailand, according to DellaPergola’s analysis, few are prepared to speak publicly, citing a mistrust of the media and fear of anti-Israel sentiment. An exception, however, was Noy Katsman, an Israeli student who was on an internship in Leipzig, Germany, when Hamas attacked. Among those killed was Katsman’s brother Hayim, an academic and peace activist murdered on kibbutz Holit, near Gaza. Katsman, 29, who is nonbinary, has now applied for citizenship in Germany - a country their grandmother fled in the 1930s. “I didn’t want to leave but the political situation is impossible and there’s more and more discrimination against leftists, activists and of course Palestinians,” Katsman told CNN. “There were a lot of articles about my brother being a peace activist and then all of the comments were very nasty, saying he deserved it and was naive,” said Katsman, who has repeatedly spoken out against the war in the international media, including on CNN. “It’s obvious that the Israeli state is using our grief to create more grief and I don’t want this. I think it’s terrible. Someone wrote to me saying ‘you don’t sound like someone whose brother was killed on October 7.’ They want to own our narrative.” Nonetheless, Katsman’s ties with home endure, as they regularly visit and are studying for a masters in culture and gender studies at Israel’s Open University. “If there’s peace I’d go back tomorrow,” said Katsman. “If there’s an end to the conflict and people get justice and human rights, of course I’d love to go back. I love the land, I love the people, I love the culture – but I don’t love the state.” For others, seeing incidents of antisemitism on the rise in Europe and elsewhere, Israel feels like a safe haven. German Jewish journalist and writer Mirna Funk, 44, applied to make Aliyah with her daughter two months after October 7. She told CNN she’d long been warning about rising antisemitism in the German media, but things dramatically worsened. “I had been observing this shift and monitoring it for about 10 years so I understood immediately after October 7 what I had witnessed and that things would only get worse,” she said. “I was getting death threats on a weekly level and did not feel safe. I didn’t want (my daughter) to be isolated in a Jewish school but it had become clear that she could not go to public school anymore.” While she still works in the German media, Funk now lives in Jaffa, a city with a mixed Jewish and Arab population, and her daughter studies at a “coexistence school,” where children from both backgrounds study alongside each other. “Life is much freer,” she said. Speaking to CNN, DellaPergola, the Hebrew University demographer, stressed that the situation is “very complicated,” not least because Israel was riven by social divisions prior to October 7, as illustrated by months of against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, the most right-wing in Israel’s history, and its policies. “You need to look at the present in a longer-term vision and understand migration movements to and from Israel,” he said. “The general image is that Aliyah is fundamentally an ideological choice – people wishing to rejoin their people, their religion and thinking of the future of their children, as well as the pressure of antisemitism.” While this is true in some cases, he said, his studies have led him to conclude that economic considerations are usually more important. “The dominant engine of migration to Israel has been shown to be the economic situation in the countries of origin. If the situation in Israel is better, Israel is more attractive. If not, it’s less attractive,” he said. Yigal Palmor, head of international relations at the Jewish Agency for Israel, which facilitates Aliyah, told CNN: “People have many motivations for coming to Israel. Antisemitism is one of them, but it’s certainly not the only motivation.” Palmor confirmed the drop in Aliyah but said he had expected it to be “more marked.” “Many people are reluctant to come at this time, but others feel the need to stand by us, become Israelis and contribute to the country when it needs it most.” DellaPergola sees the changing migration picture as part of a wider uncertainty being felt by Jewish people around the world. “Everybody’s unsatisfied and fearful and thinks there’s a better pasture somewhere else but it’s not true. There’s no reserve duty in the West, no missiles, no alarms. On the other hand, you read about unbelievable antisemitic aggressions in Western countries,” he said. “Jewish people are feeling very disorientated.”", "tags": ["jews", "antisemitism", "offers", "others", "shelter", "israel", "prompted", "country", "global"]},
{"content": "Egyptian-American comedian and satirist made a long-awaited comeback to Egyptian TV on Tuesday night, having been off air for more than a decade after going into exile following intense pressure from Egyptian authorities over his critical political satire.

Introducing the pre-recorded interview with Youssef, Salem said the announcement of the comedian’s appearance had “sent shockwaves everywhere” and that a sizable segment of the audience must have been gathered with their “entire family, ready with popcorn, waiting in front of the TV.” Before his appearance, Youssef told fans in a social media post that “just like your first time seeing me was in my laundry room in Egypt, you are about to see me again on Egyptian television from my laundry room in Los Angeles,” jokingly adding that he accepted a fee of $22 million. The ON TV announcement ahead of Tuesday described Youssef as “the most eminent Arab media personality (right now).” Youssef has a history of intense and high-profile tugs-of-war with Egypt’s authoritarian regimes, has been in power since 2014. Egyptian authorities are frequently the punchlines of his jokes, and they’ve retaliated by suspending his television show multiple times and imposing fines of upwards of $10 million. The appearance is Youssef’s first on Egyptian media since he left the country more than a decade ago. A cardiac surgeon by training, Youssef rose to prominence in the Arab world via “B+,” his YouTube show. He later became host of late-night program “El-Bernameg” (“The Show”). “El-Bernameg” spanned four seasons on four television networks between 2012 and 2014 –  including ON TV – before getting pulled off air of a different state-linked network after the commander-in-chief of the Egyptian military (and current Egyptian president) Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi came on the receiving end of Youssef’s jokes. Youssef’s star later rose in the United States and other parts of the Anglosphere when he became known as the “Jon Stewart of the Arab World.” In recent years, Youssef has gained a higher profile for his pro-Palestine activism, though not without a fair share of notoriety. ON TV’s announcement regarding Youssef’s Egyptian media comeback claimed that this activism would be the primary focus of his appearances – he is due to feature on future episodes. The show’s debut date of October 7, which marked the two-year anniversary of Hamas’ attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli war in Gaza, was a seemingly peculiar decision given Egypt’s central role alongside Qatar as key mediators for a ceasefire. “After October 7 (2023), I had to start learning from scratch about the whole cause,” Youssef shared during the interview, which primarily focused on his pro-Palestine activism. “I thought I already knew a lot about Palestine, but I realized I was actually very ignorant.” Youssef was asked how he coped with his newfound mounting fame because of his activism, which also came with accusations of antisemitism. He discussed an infamous shouting match that took place between himself and British journalist Piers Morgan over the Israel-Hamas war shortly after it broke out – a moment he singled out as a career catalyst of sorts. Youssef also spoke about how he gained his footing in the Anglosphere, which the comedian characterized as “(the kind of) stuff that White people like” in apparent reference to his story becoming a rallying cry for free speech in the Arab World. CNN has reached out to Youssef for further comment. Youssef himself had previously rejected the idea of reprising his show on any Arab network while he’s in exile, likening such a move to selling out. Despite this, he had seemingly relaxed his stance since, notably appearing in 2024 as a judge on season seven of “Arabs Got Talent,” the Middle Eastern adaptation of the “Got Talent” franchise, which airs on the Saudi state-linked network MBC.", "tags": ["satirist", "comeback", "tv", "decade", "state", "youssef", "exile", "bassem", "egyptian"]},
{"content": "Israel assesses that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza, according to three Israeli sources, a fact that may complicate efforts to finalize a deal to end the war. Sources say the Israeli government is aware that Hamas may not know the location of, or is unable to retrieve, the remains of some of the 28 remaining deceased hostages. The latest intelligence is believed to put the number in single figures; some sources had earlier suggested it may have been higher. One of the sources said the assessments are based on Israeli intelligence reports, as well as messaging from Hamas and mediators in recurring rounds of negotiations. The reason for the difference in the two assessments was not clear. There are 20 hostages who are believed to be alive, with grave concerns for the well-being of two of them. During the latest negotiations for a hostage and ceasefire deal in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, Israel has demanded the return of all the hostages – both living and dead – as a condition for ending the war. The three Israeli sources say Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet have known for months that Hamas does not know the whereabouts of some of the deceased hostages and may therefore be unable to meet that demand.  CNN has asked the Israeli government for comment. The United States has also known about the issue for some time, with negotiators in the Biden administration aware that some hostages were held by factions in Gaza over which Hamas does not exert full control. Barbara Leaf, Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs under President Joe Biden, told CNN: “It’s been the case from the outset that they (Hamas) have not had control over all of the hostages.” Leaf said recovering the remains of some of the dead hostages could be difficult. “It’s far more likely they can recover all of the living hostages,” she said. It is unclear how this uncertainty could affect the efforts to finalize the deal announced on Wednesday. One Israeli source said that Israel’s official position is that Hamas is responsible for all the deceased hostages and the Israeli government expects all of them to be returned. The source said that Hamas might use the uncertainty over its ability to return all the dead hostages to draw out the implementation of any ceasefire arrangements, and to insist that it would not return all remaining hostages until Israel agrees to a full military withdrawal from Gaza. Another Israeli source expressed concern that Netanyahu might use the uncertainty as a pretext to derail talks. Critics of the Israeli prime minister, including opposition leaders and families of hostages, have repeatedly accused him of deliberately undermining negotiations to end the war, alleging he imposes new conditions for political reasons, particularly when agreements appear close. However, other sources say that given the heavy American and regional pressure to secure a deal, Netanyahu is more likely to use the issue as leverage over the final details of an agreement, rather than torpedoing the entire framework under US President Donald Trump’s 20-point proposal. Gal Hirsch, a former Israeli military commander who now acts as hostage coordinator for the Israeli government, said Thursday that a joint task force will be set up to try and find the missing remains of dead hostages. The task force will include representation from Israel, the United States, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. The uncertainty about deceased hostages is particularly sensitive in Israeli society, as it resonates with previous unresolved cases of missing soldiers. Lieutenant Hadar Goldin was killed and his body taken by Hamas during the seven-week war in Gaza in 2014. His body has never been handed over, and is now counted among the 48 living and dead hostages Israel demands be returned. Goldin’s family has campaigned for years for his return, citing Israel’s commitment to the principle of leaving no-one behind in conflict. Ron Arad, an Israeli Air Force navigator, was captured when his jet was shot down over Lebanon in 1986. Nearly four decades later, his unresolved disappearance remains one of Israel’s most painful symbols. One of Netanyahu’s closest confidants, Natan Eshel, wrote a message to a group of journalists last week, referring to the Gaza negotiations and saying “there will be some Ron Arads” – an indication that senior figures in the Israeli political establishment believe that some hostages’ bodies will never be returned.

More than two years after Hamas and its allies kidnapped 251 people from Israel and took them to Gaza, 47 hostages remain in the enclave, with at least 20 believed to be alive. The remains of another hostage, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Hadar Goldin, have been held there since 2014, when he was killed and his body taken to the strip. The Israeli government has said 26 of the 48 hostages are deceased, although the status of two others – Tamir Nimrodi and Bipin Joshi – remains uncertain. The government previously expressed “grave concern” over their fates. The hostages who are believed to be alive are all men and all but one are in their 20s and 30s. Women, children and men over the age of 50 were under previous ceasefire agreements. One woman, Inbar Hayman, is among the 26 in Gaza who have been declared dead. Of those still believed to be living or whose status is unknown, 11 were taken from the Nova music festival. Eight were kidnapped from several kibbutzim, or small communities, in southern Israel. Three are Israeli soldiers – two were kidnapped from military bases and one from a tank. Here is what we know about them. Twin brothers were kidnapped from their home in kibbutz Kfar-Aza during the October 7 terror attack. They were 26 at the time. Speaking to CNN in February, their mother Liran Berman said other hostages who had been released had told the family the brothers were alive and separated from each other. Several of the hostages were kidnapped alongside friends and family members, some of whom have since returned home. Brothers were kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz, alongside Ariel’s partner Yehoud, David’s wife Sharon, and their three-year-old twin daughters, Yuli and Emma. Sharon, Yuli and Emma were released under a ceasefire agreement in November 2023, while Yehoud was freed earlier this year. was visiting his brother Iair when they were kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz. Iair was released earlier this year. A propaganda video showing him saying goodbye to Eitan was released by Hamas in March. The Horn family said that seeing him in the video “broke their hearts.” “Since Iair returned to us, he hasn’t stopped thinking about and working for Eitan and all the other hostages he met in captivity who are still there,” the family said in a statement. and his partner Illana Gritzewsky were kidnapped from the same kibbutz as the Horn brothers. Gritzewsky, a Mexican national, was released on November 30, 2023, as part of a short-lived hostage-and-ceasefire deal, while Zangauker was left behind. then 46, was kidnapped when Hamas gunmen broke into his family’s home in kibbutz Nahal Oz. In April 2024, Hamas put out a video showing Miran, alongside American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, who has since been released. and are childhood best friends who were kidnapped together from the Nova Music Festival. In February 2025, Hamas filmed Gilboa-Dalal and David watching other hostages being released, posting the video to Telegram. Gilboa-Dalal’s brother Gal told CNN this amounted to psychological torment. “To make them see what freedom might look like for them and then close the door and drag them back to hell – it’s awful,” he said. was also kidnapped from the Nova festival alongside his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, who was in an IDF operation in central Gaza in June 2024.

Otherwise, I wouldn’t recognize him because you couldn’t hear his voice or see his face,” she told CNN. , a Nepali student, was working at a farm in kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel when he was kidnapped. His family said earlier this week that a previously unseen video showing him alive in captivity was recently recovered by the Israeli military in Gaza. The video is believed to have been filmed in November 2023, just weeks after Joshi’s kidnapping. In a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the family said the video had given them “unwavering faith” that Joshi is alive. Israeli officials had previously said there were “grave concerns” for Joshi. Besides Joshi, three other foreign nationals are still held in Gaza, two of them from Thailand and one from Tanzania. All three – Sonthaya Oakkharasri and Sudthisak Rinthalak, from Thailand, and Joshua Mollel, from Tanzania – have been declared dead by the Israeli government. The bodies of the 26 hostages who have been declared dead by the government are also set to be returned as part of the agreement announced on Wednesday. However, three Israeli sources told CNN that the location of, or may be unable to retrieve, the remains of some of them.

{"content": "News of the reached between Israel and Hamas was met with celebrations and joyous scenes in both Gaza and Israel, though residents on both sides of the devastating war expressed trepidation that a deal may still fall through. US President Donald Trump that negotiators had reached an agreement in the Egyptian city of Sharm El Sheikh late Wednesday, saying Israel and Hamas had signed off on the first phase of a ceasefire framework. The plan includes the release of all hostages held by Hamas and the withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed upon line, according to Trump. A Qatari official later said will “lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid.” However, there is a still a lack of clarity on key sticking points, including the disarmament of Hamas, the future governance of Gaza as well as what, if any, security guarantees have been made to stop hostilities from erupting once again. Jubilant crowds gathered in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square to celebrate the agreement, with many people expressing joy that the hostages held captive by Hamas may finally come home. Former hostages released as part of earlier ceasefire agreements, and families of those still held captive, joined the crowds who were hugging, singing and raising glasses. Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan Zangauker remains in captivity with Hamas, joined the spirited crowds on Thursday morning. Appearing overwhelmed, she joined in with chants that translate in English to “We will bring Matan back.” “Our hearts are filled with joy, I cannot even know how to hold it in,” Tel Aviv resident Hillel Mayer told CNN from the square. Palestinians in Gaza heralded the agreement, cautiously hoping it would bring an end to Israel’s devastating assault on the besieged enclave, which now lies in ruins. Crowds gathered near Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis to celebrate in the predawn darkness, clapping and cheering. “I feel like I could fly with joy,” Ali Aref Abu Ouda from Beit Hanoun told CNN. He said he hoped that the nightmare he and his loved ones were living would finally stop. “The war will stop and the suffering and moving from place to place and the nightmare will end. But now we do not know what we will do. There are no houses, no schools, no universities, nothing remains,” he said. But underlining the precarious nature of such agreements, the Israeli military said it had instructed its soldiers to “be ready for any scenario.” And the military’s Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned Palestinians in Gaza not to return north or approach areas where Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers are stationed. Even as celebrations broke out, journalists in Gaza told CNN that Israeli , especially in Gaza City. Abu Mohammad Abu Yassin, from Jabalya in northern Gaza, told CNN he was not going to return home just yet. “In the past there was a truce and we hoped, then the war returned and we lost people. I am one of those affected. My son was 9 years old sitting in the street when a shard struck his eye and he lost his eye,” he said. Abu Yassin said he feared what would come next. “We will feel the effects of the war after the ceasefire. We are now preoccupied with how to feed our children. When the truce comes everything will be provided and then we will remember and enter into the psychological suffering after the war.” In Israel, the families of hostages held in Gaza, and hostages who had been previously released, celebrated the news of the agreement – with many personally thanking Trump. “I can’t believe it,” said released hostage Ohad Ben Ami in a video on Instagram. “You’re coming back home,” said Liran Berman, whose twin brothers Gali and Ziv are still being held in Gaza after being abducted from Kfar Aza kibbutz in southern Israel. “My Gali and Zivi I love you so much.” The twins were last seen alive by witnesses in February, when the last hostage release was held during a fragile ceasefire that later fell apart when Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza. Video released by the Hostages Families Forum showed Trump on the phone with hostage family members and captivity survivors in Washington, telling them their loved ones will return on Monday. The group, some visibly emotional, can be heard shouting “thank you” and cheering. The agreement came a day after the two-year anniversary of the Hamas-led attacks that killed at least 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023, and took 251 people hostage. Hamas and its allies , including one whose body has been held since 2014. The Israeli government believes at least 20 of them are alive. The joy of the hostages’ anticipated return and emotional reunions has been tempered to some extent by a feeling of intense trepidation against a backdrop of lingering distrust and previous false hopes. “We remain hopeful, but we’re also grounded in reality. We know war is the kingdom of uncertainty and nothing is concluded until we see it with our eyes,” Moshe Lavi, whose brother-in-law Omri Miran is still held in Gaza, told CNN. “Until we see Omri ourselves, we will not believe it,” he added. “We are happy inside, truly, the joy is deep, but we need to be realistic,” said former Israeli hostage Eliya Cohen at the Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, Reuters reported. “Until they’re getting on the Red Cross vehicle, and really meeting IDF soldiers, until that moment, we must continue to pray.” It was in the early hours of the morning in Gaza when the agreement was announced. With little internet connection in the besieged strip, many people there were still not aware of the agreement, journalists in Gaza told CNN. Before the sun rose in Gaza City, a young girl told a journalist how happy she was about the agreement because she would be able to return home. “We’ve spent two years, and now we’re starting the third, living in a war. We’re very tired of this life,” the girl said in a video obtained by CNN. A small but joyous crowd gathered in Khan Younis, singing, dancing and cheering in video obtained by Reuters. Khan Younis resident, Wael Radwan, credited Trump with the agreement – and thanked “anyone who contributed even if verbally to stop the war and to stop the bloodshed.” Another resident Abdul Majeed Abd Rabbo said “all of the Gaza Strip is happy” about the announcement. “All the Arab people, all of the world is happy with the ceasefire and the end of bloodshed,” he said, according to Reuters. Israel’s war has caused across Gaza, and the enclave has been by escalating scenes of More than 67,000 people, most of them women and children, have been killed, the Palestinian health ministry said on Wednesday, and Palestinians under relentless bombing, mass displacement and the spread of disease.

{"content": "It’s been two years since Hamas’ attack on October 7 led to Israel’s and life in the enclave has never been harder. With at least 67,173 people killed and another 169,780 injured, one in nine people alive in Gaza before the war has been wounded or is dead, the Ministry of Health in the enclave reported on Tuesday. A is spreading across the territory and the vast majority of people have lost their homes and livelihoods. Many have lost hope too, despite the indirect between Israel and Hamas currently underway in Egypt. Israel launched the war after the October 7, 2023 terror attacks in which Hamas and its allies killed more than 1,200 people and took 251 hostages to Gaza. Israel’s conduct in the war has been such that international experts, including the International Association of Genocide Scholars, two leading Israeli human rights organizations and an independent United Nations inquiry, have concluded that against Palestinians in Gaza – ﻿an accusation the Israeli government has consistently denied. For people in Gaza, life has long become about survival. About trying, and almost always failing, to secure the basic necessities for their loved ones. Here are the stories of a few of them, shared with CNN through messages and phone calls. For months, Mahmoud Nabil Faraj and his family have been surviving on one meal a day. But there have been many occasions when he had no choice but to forgo food altogether, he said, to make sure that his 7-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter, at least, could eat something. “These are the hardest days we’ve ever lived,” he told CNN. “Our children are deprived of the basic foods needed to grow, and our bodies have become frail and weak due to the lack of nutrition.” Most of the time now there is no food or water, he said. “When there is some, it barely meets the minimum requirements for survival. There are no fruits whatsoever. Milk and dairy products are unavailable. Eggs are 100% missing. Meat and poultry are also unavailable.” Many people, himself included, are now suffering from frequent dizziness because of persistently low blood sugar, he said. “The prices of basic goods are skyrocketing… only God knows how we manage to afford even that one meal,” he told CNN. When available – which is not often – a single kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sugar now sells for $150, he said. Before the war, Faraj owned a grocery store and his wife ran an optometry center in Shuja’iyya, an eastern neighbourhood of Gaza City. Both businesses have been destroyed in Israeli attacks, as was their home, he said. They fled the area before the strikes. “We used to eat the finest food and wear the nicest clothes,” Faraj said. “Now we are displaced in western Gaza.” Faraj said he was 253 pounds before the war started two years ago. Now, he weighs no more than 154 pounds. Raghad Izzat Hammouda has been hungry and malnourished for many months, surviving on a poor diet of small quantities of mostly canned food. But it is her six younger siblings she is most worried about. “They had beautiful dreams; they aspired to travel, get an education and obtain excellence certificates. But today, their highest dream is to gather firewood and fetch water, and they are happy if they eat a morsel of bread? Can you imagine that?” the 20-year-old from Gaza City told CNN. She said her parents often skip meals and give all of the food they have to the children. “My mother and father are suffering greatly. Like all of the parents in Gaza, when they see their children hungry and crying because they are thirsty and hungry,” she said. Hammouda said there is no fruit or meat at the markets in Gaza, and that the few vegetables that are available are so expensive they remain out of reach. “Before the war, my family’s food was varied and diverse… But now, unfortunately, none of that is available,” she said. “Right now, all our food consists of canned goods… canned fava beans, peas, canned meat, and so on … and legumes like chickpeas, lentils and beans.” She said she has lost 10 relatives in the war, including her 80-year-old grandmother, Tamam, who she said was killed by Israeli forces. “They did not allow us to bury her until a week after her death,” she said. Mohammed Saeed Al-Khatib was stunned when he saw a photo a friend took of him. “I was shocked by how much I had changed in appearance. We no longer have mirrors, and I hadn’t seen myself in a long time,” he told CNN. Al-Khatib reckons he has lost more than a third of his weight since the war started in Gaza, dropping from 143 kilograms (315 pounds) to roughly 90 kilos (200 pounds). The 42-year-old is from the Al-Zahra neighborhood in Gaza City, a place he said used to be one of the most beautiful areas in the whole of Gaza. Over the past two years, it has been destroyed by relentless Israeli aerial and ground attacks. “My children’s lives changed drastically: no schools, no health care, no proper food or clean water. Diseases surround them from every direction,” he said. Al-Khatib has four children: Saba, 12, Hussein, 9, Julia, 4, and Hassan, who is just 2 years old. Al-Khatib’s home an﻿d almost everything his family owned is long gone. He said they have been displaced more than six times, living in tents and rented apartments across Gaza. Finding food and water is a daily struggle, he said. At many points during the past two years, Al-Khatib and his family had no choice but to take desperate measures to survive. “We used spoiled flour infested with insects and worms just to feed the children. We cleaned and ate rotting vegetables, consumed rice unfit for human consumption, ate expired canned goods, and drank unsafe water,” he said. Mohammed Matar says he had a good lif﻿e before the war started. He worked as a graphic designer and his family always had enough to eat and drink. Their financial situation was good enough to allow them to go out and have fun on a regular basis. And as someone who had always been on the heavier side, he had spent decades trying to lose weight, never quite succeeding. It’s a life that seems so distant now that it’s almost impossible to imagine. “My children suffer from health issues and malnutrition. One is 4 years old, the other one is 2,” he said. “We buy one kilo of flour and try to make it last for two and a half days. Sometimes I go to sleep without dinner so that my son can go to kindergarten and at least eat half a loaf of bread in the morning,” he told CNN. Matar said he can see the impacts of this lack of nutritious food on his own body. He has lost a significant amount of weight in the past two months and feels exhausted. His hands ache. Carrying a bucket of water to the second floor has become a task that is physically too difficult now, he said. He and his family — his wife and two young children — were displaced from their home in the Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City to Rafah in the south early in the war. When Israeli troops entered Rafah, the family moved to just west of Al-Qarara near Khan Younis. When the Israelis began closing in on that area, they fled to Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. The rest of his family is scattered all over. “My mother and two sisters are in Al-Maghazi (in central Gaza), one brother is in Gaza City, and I have a sister in Turkey. I am always thinking of them,” he said. Forty-year-old Eyad Amawi has been watching his children waste away despite his best efforts to keep them fed and healthy. He told CNN they have all lost a significant amount of weight and are struggling with weakness. His youngest son, Youssef, who is only 4 years old, is suffering from liver inflammation and intestinal infections caused by severe malnutrition, he said. “My wife and I often do not eat at all so there is enough food for the children. We adults reduce our portions, especially of bread, so the children can have it. But bread alone is not enough to survive without nutritious food. And to this day, meat, eggs, chicken, and other essential nutritious items are not allowed to enter,” he said. Amawi and his family have been displaced in Deir al-Balah due to heavy bombardment in his neighbourhood in Gaza City. He said they have not eaten in a normal way since the war began. “Sometimes we manage through small aid distributions or by buying flour when it is available during the tight blockade. Most of the time we rely only on lentils or rice, and in rare periods we managed to get some potatoes,” he said. He said the war has changed every aspect of the family’s life. Several of his relatives have been killed and some of his nieces and nephews have been injured. “These losses have left a deep wound in our family,” he said. “We have lost our normal life and lost hope. Our lives changed from stability and safety to constant fear; from having electricity, water and food to struggling to find the most basic essentials.” This article has been updated to provide additional context in the first paragraph.", "tags": ["war", "heartbreak", "loss", "gaza", "palestinians", "years"]},

Speaking at a meeting with Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev in Tajikistan’s capital of Dushanbe, where both were attending a summit of the former Soviet nations, Putin pledged to punish those responsible and provide compensation. Azerbaijani authorities had said the jet was hit accidentally by Russian fire, then tried to land in western Kazakhstan, where it crashed and killed 38 of 67 people aboard. Days after the crash, Putin apologized to Aliyev for what he called a “tragic incident” but stopped short of acknowledging responsibility. Aliyev, meanwhile, criticized Moscow for trying to “hush up” the incident. The controversy over the crash has roiled the previously warm ties between Moscow and Baku. Their relations were further destabilized by deaths of ethnic Azerbaijanis rounded up by police in a Russian city in June and a series of arrests of Russians in Azerbaijan. Speaking to Aliyev on Thursday, Putin said that Russian air defenses that targeted a Ukrainian drone fired on the Azerbaijani airliner because of a “technical malfunction,” adding that two missiles exploded just 10 meters (33 feet) away from the passenger jet. “The Russian side will obviously do everything to provide compensation and give legal assessment to all responsible officials’ action,” he said. “Of course, these words related to this tragedy, aimed at supporting –morally supporting – the families do not solve the main problem: We can’t bring back to life those who died as a result of the tragedy,” Putin added. He voiced hope for overcoming the strain between the countries and fully rebuilding the ties. “I hope that our cooperation not only will be restored, but continue in the spirit of our relations, the spirit of our alliance,” he said. Aliyev, for his part, thanked Putin for investigating the cause of the plane’s downing. “I would like to thank you for keeping the situation under your personal control,” he said. The Azerbaijani leader said they had a chance to discuss a “broad and positive” bilateral agenda, voicing hope that “the messages we are sending today to our societies will meet a positive response.”", "tags": ["year", "putin", "jet", "air", "russian", "crash", "defenses", "responsible", "azerbaijani"]},
{"content": "Pope Leo XIV, writing in the first major document of his pontificate, has denounced the “dictatorship” of economic inequality while insisting the Catholic Church is committed to supporting “rejected” migrants. Leo’s almost 40-page text, released on Thursday, focuses on poverty, emphasizing the Catholic Church’s long commitment to the socially disadvantaged while offering a strong critique of the global economic system. The first American pope calls on Catholics to work on eradicating “unjust” economic structures, insisting that concern for the poor is non-negotiable. Leo also criticizes those in the church who simply want to teach “sound doctrine” and even “ridicule” charitable works. “We need to be increasingly committed to resolving the structural causes of poverty,” Leo writes in an “Apostolic Exhortation” titled “Dilexi te” (“I have loved you”). “Unjust structures need to be recognized and eradicated by the force of good, by changing mindsets but also, with the help of science and technology, by developing effective policies for societal change,” he writes. An exhortation is a high-level papal document and is normally an appeal to Catholics centered on a specific theme. Leo explains that “Dilexi te” was being prepared by Pope Francis in the final months of his life, but that he was “happy to make this document my own.” Leo’s exhortation regularly quotes Francis, including his concerns about inequality, which he said leads to an “economy that kills,” along with “trickle-down” economics. While the late pope’s critique of the global economic system saw him face criticism from some Catholics in the United States, Leo has shown he shares his predecessor’s concerns. He criticizes “pseudo-scientific data” that argues “a free market economy” will lift people out of poverty, or that it is the government’s responsibility to deal with the problem. And Leo warns against a “worldliness” inside the church which suggests working with the “elite” to find solutions in exchange for the church receiving privileges and security. “We must continue, then, to denounce the ‘dictatorship of an economy that kills,’” Leo writes. “There is no shortage of theories attempting to justify the present state of affairs or to explain that economic thinking requires us to wait for invisible market forces to resolve everything. Nevertheless, the dignity of every human person must be respected today, not tomorrow, and the extreme poverty of all those to whom this dignity is denied should constantly weigh upon our consciences.” Cardinal Michael Czerny, part of a panel that presented the document at a press conference in the Vatican, was asked to what extent it was the work of Leo or of Francis. “This is Pope Leo’s document, it is the magisterium of the church,” Czerny said, although he added that no pope starts with “an empty desk or clear agenda.” Czerny, who leads the Vatican’s department for “integral human development,” said Francis felt the attacks he experienced from some conservative groups in the church were “always a sign that he was actually doing something.” The late pope was sometimes labelled a “Marxist” or “Communist” by critics. Czerny said: “The problem is not Pope Francis’ or Pope Leo’s, the problem is the attacker.” Concern for the poor, Leo explains, includes support for migrants, which he says is supported by scripture and includes “refugee reception centers, border missions” and is defined by efforts to “welcome, promote, protect and integrate” new arrivals to a country. “Where the world sees threats, she (the church) sees children; where walls are built, she builds bridges,” Leo explains. “She (the church) knows that her proclamation of the Gospel is credible only when it is translated into gestures of closeness and welcome. And she knows that in every rejected migrant, it is Christ himself who knocks at the door of the community.” The Chicago-born pope also cites a telling historical example, pointing to the work of Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini, an Italian-American religious sister who died in 1917 and is the first US citizen to be declared a saint. Leo references her work assisting poor Italian immigrants arriving in the US at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries and, quoting John Paul II, remarks that these newcomers were “often victims of the unscrupulous.” Cabrini, who founded schools, hospitals and orphanages, was declared “Patroness of All Migrants” in 1950 by Pope Pius XII. While Leo has adopted a more low-key and reserved style than his predecessor, he has voiced his concern about what he called the “inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States” and is now facing criticism . In a sign of continuity with his predecessor, Leo signed the text on poverty on October 4, the feast of Saint Francis of Assisi, the late pope’s namesake. On the same day his exhortation was released, Leo met with Labor leaders from Chicago and expressed his appreciation for their “welcome of immigrants and refugees.” The Vatican also released his message to a gathering of the Catholic Charities USA Network in Puerto Rico, where he described migrants as “missionaries of hope.” The day before his exhortation was published, Leo met Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, Texas, a prominent advocate for refugees in the US, telling Seitz the church “cannot be silent” on the plight of immigrants. He encouraged them to help the “newly arrived brothers and sisters to be living witnesses of hope, recognizing that they have an intrinsic human dignity and are invited to participate fully in community life.” In his document, Leo insists on a “preferential option for the poor,” citing the contribution of the Catholic Church in Latin and Central America to social justice, to which he says, as a former missionary in Peru, he is “greatly indebted.”", "tags": ["text", "dictatorship", "inequality", "support", "economic", "xiv", "leo", "migrants", "major"]},
{"content": "French President Emmanuel Macron Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu to his post, despite accepting his resignation Monday following the collapse of his overnight government. “The president of the republic has named Mr Sébastien Lecornu prime minister and has charged him with forming a government,” the Élysée Palace said in a statement Friday. In a post on X mapping out his thoughts on the government he will form, Lecornu said: “We must put an end to this political crisis that is exasperating the French people and to this instability that is detrimental to France’s image and its interests.” He was a surprise choice, rounding off a rollercoaster week in French politics. Late Sunday, Lecornu announced his cabinet, before it was publicly criticized by his interior minister that same night. On Monday morning, he submitted his resignation – which was accepted – before Macron reversed course and asked him to quarterback the selection of his successor in a 48-hour blitz round of talks with political opponents. Despite those efforts, for Macron, the solution to the domino-like collapse of recent prime ministers was apparently simple: more of the same. That decision was met with anger from his opponents. The president of the far-right National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, blasted the decision as “a bad joke, a democratic disgrace, and a humiliation for the French people,” in a post on X following the announcement. The far-right figurehead Marine Le Pen – currently out of political office pending an appeal for campaign finance irregularities – called to immediately vote out Lecornu’s as-of-yet unannounced government and to have new elections, in a post on X. On the far-left, Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the France Unbowed party, ridiculed Lecornu’s reappointment, adding, “Macron can do nothing other than Macron.” The political paralysis around assembling a cabinet and passing a budget has earned France unwelcome comparisons to European countries like Italy, with reputations for political instability. Lecornu appeared to have negotiated a safeguard against further political unrest. In his X post on Friday, he flagged an apparent compromise he had agreed to: that any issues raised in the past days’ consultations with party leaders would be open to parliamentary debate. In his second term, Macron has repeatedly forced legislation through the National Assembly without a vote. This isn’t especially surprising. Ahead of his disastrous cabinet announcement last Sunday, Lecornu had already waved off using this power to sidestep the French parliament again. But Lecornu did have one surprise to share. “All ambitions are legitimate and useful, but those who join the Government must commit to disengaging themselves from the presidential ambitions for 2027,” he wrote on X. The move will likely exclude figures like Bruno Retailleau, the right-wing former interior minister, who is expected to run in 2027. Similarly, leaders of the far-left and far-right parties will be excluded from government, perhaps unsurprisingly, as both parties’ leaderships, including Le Pen if her appeal is successful, are expected to stand against Macron’s would-be centrist successor. While Lecornu hasn’t yet revealed his cabinet, the final consultations with the president Friday were with Macron’s central bloc and the traditional left and right-wing parties. The far-left and far-right were excluded from discussions. Lecornu faced broad criticism for his choice of ministers in Sunday night’s cabinet. After promising a break with the past two prime ministers, amid a divided political landscape in France, he announced a ministerial selection that featured more Macron allies than in the president’s very first cabinet in 2017. Lecornu took nearly a month to name his first short-lived cabinet. Many in France will be closely following his choice of colleagues second-time round.", "tags": ["french", "reappoints", "monday", "president", "move", "shock", "prime", "minister"]},

{"content": "Speaking with democracy activists recently from Hungary and Poland, former President Barack Obama warned about the “rising wave of authoritarianism sweeping the globe,” even in countries once believed unsusceptible to an erosion of liberties. “We’re seeing politicians target civil society, undermine freedom of the press, weaponize the justice system,” Obama went on. “And no one is being spared. Even countries that thought they were immune from wholesale assaults on democracy now understand that we’re all part of one struggle.” Obama didn’t mention his successor by name. But he’s against President Donald Trump throughout a series of public appearances this year, amping up his criticism of Trump’s second term and expressing concern about the state of American politics. The panelists Obama spoke with at an event last month previously participated in the Obama Foundation’s young leaders program. They were Sándor Léderer, who co-founded an anti-corruption watchdog ground in Hungary; Stefania Kapronczay, who until recently served as co-director of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union; and Zuzanna Rudzinska-Bluszcz, who served as the Deputy Justice Minister for Poland from December 2023 to August 2025. “I’ve become increasingly concerned about the rising wave of authoritarianism sweeping the globe,” Obama said in a video introducing the conversation, which took place in London. The comments were a veiled, if clear, rebuke of not only the current US administration but also some of the leaders Trump has aligned himself with since taking office. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is a champion of what he calls “illiberal democracy,” and is often . Orbán has become a darling to MAGA conservatives, and the president has praised him as a “very great leader” and “very strong man.” In Poland, meanwhile, a firebrand aligned with the right-wing populist Law and Justice party in June, a political upset that could torpedo the centrist government’s efforts to unspool the legacy of authoritarianism in the country. Trump has tried to deploy military assets to Democratic-led cities against their leaders’ wishes, urged the Justice Department to bring indictments against his political rivals and lashed out at judges who attempt to block his actions. Obama didn’t raise any of those examples specifically. But he pointed to promises — empty ones, in his view — offered by politicians to “go back to the way things were” that hewed closely to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” message. At the same time, the former president offered an acknowledgment that sclerotic bureaucracies and unresponsive politicians had, in many ways, ushered in a global populist wave. “In the United States, for example, there will need to be laws that are changed so that action can be taken more effectively, more quickly to respond to problems in a lawful way,” Obama said during his discussion. “I think what we’ve seen is that when people are frustrated, they’re willing to take any action, even if it’s unlawful, because at least there’s a sense of, something’s happening. That’s something that I think everybody has to internalize at this point.” He acknowledged that centrist politicians had, in many instances, lost the pulse of voters and allowed some of the populist anger to take hold. “A big challenge is that the governments themselves, whether center-right or center-left, were losing touch with people and weren’t delivering on some of the basic hopes and dreams of people, so you get frustrated with government, period,” he said. “That obviously then opens the door for right-wing populism, anti-immigrant sentiment, anger, grievances.” He said wealth gaps and a complex modern economies had left people feeling “as if they don’t have control, and they feel as if their politicians often don’t have control over all the different forces there.” And he said social media was “very good at making people fearful of or angry about those who don’t agree with them.” “We haven’t figured out, all right, what are the new forms of participation that can engage people and make them feel empowered so that when they act, it’s going to make a difference for them and their families,” he said. And he suggested authoritarians operate “just by breaking things” instead of building new alternatives to the systems they decry. “They can tear things down, remove constraints on their actions, and empower themselves in a small group,” he said. “In terms of being able to solve some of the big problems around health care or education, there, not so much, because that does require creating new structures. It’s not just a matter of getting a cut, taking a piece of whatever is being done and making sure your friends are rewarded and your enemies are punished.”", "tags": ["obama", "sound", "democracy"]},

{"content": "This summer, I got cultural whiplash. As a child of the ’90s and early 2000s, I grew up with my mother’s and grandmother’s generations’ fight for legal and workplace equality helping shed social misogyny. In the past decade in particular, I saw the evidence of progress in my media diet. The movies, shows, books and advertisements I consumed were increasingly giving women a seat at the table. Heroin chic fell away, and body positivity entered the fashion world. Stories about a woman stealing your man were traded for celebration of the “girl’s girl” who resisted the competition for men’s attention. And when my husband and earlier this year, our vision of what our life could be included wide-ranging possibilities, influenced in part by the movies and shows we grew up with. We saw, read and listened to stories of involved fathers, successful mothers and well-matched partners who supported one another. It seemed like women were taking a deeper breath without such heavy cultural restrictions. Then there was a shift. Was it around the 2024 presidential election? Or since the overturn of Roe v. Wade? Maybe when men’s rights activists pushed back against #MeToo? Whatever the catalyst, a change in the political environment seemed to connect with a social change that brought back narrow, and at times constrictive, ideas of womanhood depicted in media. The recent rise of weight loss medications coincided with social media influencers sharing ways to get smaller and no longer celebrating bodies of all sizes. Advertisements followed suit, making men’s desire once again a dominating factor in how stories are told, and how women are portrayed. How had these discarded ideas made their way back into circulation? Didn’t we all agree we were through with them? The culprit, I have learned, is the male gaze. It was always there, but now it has stepped back into the spotlight. The male gaze came roaring back this summer. American Eagle –– whose partner brand Aerie has been known for marketing underwear to women with imagery that celebrated stretch marks, cellulite and a range of body sizes — ran starting in July. The ads sell jeans to women featuring actor Sydney Sweeney, who many men see as a sex symbol, insinuating the clothing would make men find them more attractive. Then there was e.l.f. Beauty’s campaign led by a and disdain of a primarily female audience. And this year saw viral content around an OnlyFans star’s attempt to break the world record for most sexual partners in one day –– a lucrative career move made even more viral by her bashing the wives and girlfriends of her sexual partners and suggesting men cheating is the fault of the women who aren’t available enough for sex. “Most typically, the male gaze is about representing women in media solely to satisfy heterosexual men,” said Dr. Linda Tuncay Zayer, professor of marketing and John F. Smith, Jr. Chair in Business Administration at the Quinlan School of Business at Loyola University Chicago. If you are observing women in movies, TV, fashion, social media and marketing and they don’t feel as fully materialized as their male counterparts, that is the male gaze. “The woman’s value is reduced in so far as existing for pleasure or basically an object,” Zayer said. It’s Bond girls. And a long, lingering shot panning up a woman’s body in an advertisement for soda. It’s when an action movie accessory is running through explosions in tiny shorts and flowing curled hair before collapsing helplessly in the hero’s arms. And a social media star making a recipe while all dolled up and explaining her steps in a soft, sultry voice. The male gaze has always been around — art in the eye of the male beholder — but the term came into modern existence as a feminist theory coined by film critic Laura Mulvey in 1975. Although it started as a lens through which to view film, Mulvey specifically calling out Marilyn Monroe’s appearance in “The River of No Return” and movie director Alfred Hitchcock’s “Rear Window,” it has expanded to encompass cultural perspectives that keep men’s stories, experiences and interest as the societal priority and treat women as objects rather than active participants. The male gaze includes stories told about women in relation to a male character (think wife, daughter, victim) and media in which the camera angles and visual storytelling make the audience feel like they are viewing the women from a heterosexual male’s perspective, Zayer added. It may even be hard to recognize when media is coming from the male gaze because it is so pervasive, Zayer said. “We’re kind of a goldfish in the water where this is part of our culture,” she added. As you try to identify it, Zayer stresses the male gaze is not just about the way something looks — it’s about power. And media matters. Characters in TV and film have encouraged women to move into science, technology, engineering and math careers, . When women around the world were in 2016 about how fictional characters inspired them, 16% said they wanted to pursue more education, 12% said they took up a sport, and about 11% said they left an abusive  relationship, said Madeline Di Nonno, CEO of the Geena Davis Institute. “What happens in the world of make believe has real world impact,” she added. The dominance of the male gaze hasn’t gone unchecked. Storytellers have been presenting alternative ways of viewing women for many years. Often when women are shown as sexy or sexual on screen, it is a performance for men and doesn’t include their own search for pleasure or complex storylines. On the other hand, there is the female gaze, with shows and movies like “Bridgerton” and “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” demonstrating how women can be sexual without being objectified. Mothers and daughters weren’t accessories to the men in their lives when Greta Gerwig joined the ranks of the few female Academy Award-nominated directors — for the 2017 film, “Lady Bird.” The film’s focus on the mother-daughter relationship helped audiences explore coming of age and the experience of womanhood. One of the most successful comedies of 2011 — and all time — is a film about an ensemble of women of different races, family structures and body types getting together in “Bridesmaids.” It’s hard to tell Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy that women aren’t funny— a trope that falls outside the narrow confines of the male gaze. And beloved shows like the original “Star Trek” have appealed to audiences of all kinds while showing female characters and people of color in complex storylines and positions of power. to actor Nichelle Nichols (who played Lt. Nyota Uhura in the series that aired from 1966 to 1969) for working with the agency to help diversify its talent pool. Some have called this kind of storytelling the female gaze. And while there have been powerful works of art and media with women at their center, they are still the exception and not the rule. Take the , coined by cartoonist and graphic novelist Alison Bechdel in a comic strip. To pass it, a book, film or show must have at least two women; they must talk to each other, and about something other than a man. Failing the test is a good sign that media is part of the male gaze –– and you can probably think of plenty that can’t check any of those boxes. Throughout history, when the pendulum swings one way, it tends to eventually swing back the other way. The same is true culturally. Although the male gaze has always been part of most cultures, there have been efforts to diversify perspectives, tell more stories and bring women into more positions of power. Decades of fighting for women’s suffrage in the United States found success in 1920, which kicked off a decade of some relaxation of the restrictions on women. Instead of corseted dresses, women opted for looser-fitting “flapper” frocks with a boyish shape. But in the 1930s, trends changed again and women were in more feminine, cinched waists. When World War II broke out in 1939 and women were brought into the workplace in the ’40s, fashion reacted with more functional, utilitarian wear. But when the war ended and women were forced out of the workplace, the full-skirted “1950s housewife” was the new (old) ideal of femininity. “Historically speaking, there’s almost always a backlash after women have achieved something,” said Dr. Katherine Sredl, lecturer of marketing at Loyola University Chicago’s Quinlan School of Business. More recently, women started going than men, the started to close, women started , made strides and body positivity pressed companies to . But those trends were followed by the recent retro-popularity of and a resurgence of “thinspiration,” “skinny legends” and “what I eat in a day” videos that revived a restrictive beauty ideal on social media. The male gaze remains a profitable marketing tool. Underlying many advertisements is the message that if only a woman could be more beautiful and appealing to men, they can find love, acceptance and a better version of their lives — all for the low, low price of these weight loss gummies or that workout program, these seductive undergarments or that new fragrance. TV commercials for the fast-food chain Carl’s Jr. (or Hardee’s, depending on where you are from) used to feature models baring skin while taking a big bite. It started in the 1990s with men watching a woman eat a burger in another building through binoculars. In 2005, Paris Hilton’s ad showed her washing a car in a bikini. And celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Audrina Patridge and Kate Upton kept building on the commercial’s blueprint until about 2017. That was when Carl’s Jr. changed to focus on using the food to market the restaurants. Many advertisers had stepped away from so obviously telling women they should buy a hamburger or other products to make themselves appealing to men. The company GoDaddy launched its first commercial in 2005, when a model stood with the company name across the chest of her tank top before the strap breaks and she has to save herself from a wardrobe malfunction. The advertisements continued to feature beautiful, sexualized women — sometimes a bit of a confusing choice for a website and marketing services company — until 2013 when GoDaddy started to transition away from a strategy of scandalizing and toward a more inspirational and sophisticated approach. But the changes haven’t always stuck. Social media influencer Alix Earle was featured in a 2025 Superbowl ad for Carl’s Jr., wearing a bikini top and taking a slow-motion burger bite. There is an ideological gap between women and men — particularly younger men — when it comes to men wanting to adhere to more stereotypical gender roles, according to . This year, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that the corporate world has become “culturally neutered” and generally offices need more “masculine energy.” Meanwhile, both fringe influencers and more mainstream role models have taken to podcasts and social media to assert that women should be responsible for homemaking, and men for protecting and providing. Kansas City Chiefs player at a college commencement in 2024 and told the women that they have been told lies about their futures and probably were more excited about being wives and mothers than taking on careers. And figurehead of the online “manosphere” has preached male dominance and female submission to young boys. However, those voices are being met with other perspectives: men advocating that sharing the mental load of running a household is part of being in a family or that protecting and providing includes supporting your wife and caring for the emotional well-being of those you love. Men can be strong, good listeners and be of service to their family, they say. Men who can take care of themselves (think laundry and cooking) aren’t just good adults — they may be more attractive to women, the counter-messages say. And women often push back against narrow ideas of who they are and what they can be. Women want to see media that resonates with their lived experience, according to , which studies representation in media. That can mean stories of women being powerful, flawed, beautiful, ugly, mothers and professionals. Ultimately, women — who control a lot of spending power in society — often express loyalty to brands who give them that content, Zayer said. “The business of it makes sense,” she said. Although the concept of the male gaze originally came from film and has expanded to television, art and literature, it is deeply connected to finance, Joyrich said. When the prevailing perspective in stories, art and advertising is White and male, then those who don’t align with those identities have less power, she said. And no one is immune from the societies and cultures in which they live. Women sometimes turn the male gaze on one another. It happens when they objectify themselves, promote traditional gender roles as the ideal way of living and enforce beauty standards for others, Sredl said. Sometimes women think it is empowering to utilize the male gaze, or to make a living in a society that profits financially off their exploitation, and others do it to feel in control, Joyrich added. “I might as well sell my own sexuality before you do,” she said. But still, it’s large corporations that profit most, Joyrich said. There may be ebbs and flows in how pervasive the male gaze is, but it has never really gone away, Joyrich said. Women have made strides when it comes to representation in media — take production company championing women-led stories and films, and “Selma” director critical and box office success. But film and television has historically been dominated by male writers and directors. The efforts of female storytellers have largely been a push against the status quo. And often, the lens under which the works are viewed represent a dominantly male perspective. If women want to be and men want to see a sexy sidekick in their action movies, why not let them? The concern isn’t a woman baking in her finest pearls or wanting to be sexy — that is fine, and she should be allowed to do that, Zayer said. There are real-life implications, however, when spreading a message that women should only strive to please men and men should only see the women in their lives in one way. Often the traditional beauty standards put forward by the male gaze are unrealistic. They favor thin bodies that few people can maintain in a healthy way, Zayer said. And usually, the standards prioritize Whiteness, Joyrich added. Women who don’t naturally meet those ideals are left struggling to win a competition stacked against them. Both men and women should feel empowered to do what is right for themselves, whether that’s climb the corporate ladder or stay at home as a parent, Zayer said. The male gaze also limits men when it encourages viewing women as objects rather than complex, multidimensional human beings, Zayer said. In a world where is a crisis,  the isolation problem gets even worse when the culture tells men that women (about half the population) are for beauty, sex and running a household, and are not viable options for real emotional connection and partnership. If you want more full and rich stories about people of different genders, races, cultures and sexual orientations, you have to engage with artists of those identities, she said. Fortunately, there is no shortage of fun, meaningful, interesting and high-quality movies and TV shows that offer a wide range of perspectives. You can dive into the closeness of female relationships with movies like “Booksmart,” “Steel Magnolias” or Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women.” Or watch women be brilliant even when their sexuality isn’t in focus with “Hidden Figures,” Netflix’s “The Residence,” or “Lessons in Chemistry.” Seeing women be the heroines of the action instead of — as Reese Witherspoon cited when talking about launching her production company — helplessly asking “What do we do?” is also important. For that, I can turn to “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “A Quiet Place,” and “Black Panther.” Maybe your list is different, but I think it helps to be able to identify the media around you that expands the perspectives you are immersed in and the possibilities they present, and which ones, alternatively, make the box around identity feel a little smaller. “By talking about it, by reading different things, by getting media literacy, by creating different things, by seeing the variety of media out there — including atypical, non-normative ones — people can start to think differently,” Joyrich said.", "tags": ["gender", "gaze", "male", "progress", "years"]},

{"content": "Diane Keaton, known for her unique brand of comedic timing and inimitable style, has died, producer Dori Rath who worked with Keaton confirmed to CNN on Saturday. Keaton was 79. Her death was first reported by People magazine. CNN has reached out to her representatives, and the Los Angeles Police Department, which did not answer questions and referred inquiries to the Los Angeles Medical Examiner, which had no record of her death. No cause of death was immediately available. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department told CNN that they received a call for medical assistance this morning at Keaton’s address and paramedics transferred a person to a hospital. was a celebrated and prolific actor whose career spanned decades, early on earning an Academy Award in the best actress category for 1977’s “Annie Hall.” The film showcased Keaton’s abilities in the realm of comedy but also displayed her nimble handling of authentic and vulnerable moments. Additionally, “Annie Hall” introduced filmgoers to Keaton’s matchless and gender-nonconforming sense of style – immediately identifiable by her use of men’s slacks, vests and hats. Decidedly ahead of her time from a fashion perspective, Keaton maintained a commitment to this sartorial mix well into her older years. An undeniable comedic talent who said in 1997 that she’s “more inclined to live comfortably in the world of humor,” Keaton nonetheless also made her mark in a number of dramatic movies – including a pivotal role in Francis Ford Coppola’s acclaimed “Godfather” films, in which she played Kay, wife to Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone. Keaton, who bore no relation to Buster or Michael, was born Diane Hall in 1946 in Los Angeles. In a 2004 “Fresh Air” podcast, she talked about how her mother, a homemaker and amateur photographer, won pageants and became Mrs. Highland Park and later Mrs. Los Angeles, which first gave her the urge to perform. “I did want to go on stage, I saw that that was something that did appeal to me,” she said. “There she was in the theater, and I saw the curtain open and there was my mother, and I thought, ‘Hm, I think I’d like that for myself.’” After finding her place on the theater stage in the late 1960s in a Broadway production of “Hair” – in which she gained some notoriety for declining to perform nude for one of the musical numbers and thereby forewent a sizable (at the time) $50 bonus – Keaton burst onto the film scene with the first “Godfather” film in 1972, going on to appear in several films throughout the decade opposite the writer and director Woody Allen, who was also her romantic partner around that time. The films they acted in together include Allen’s “Sleeper” and “Play It Again Sam,” but it was her star turn in “Annie Hall,” in which she played the joyous and carefree titular character who falls in love with Allen’s bumbling, self-hating comedian, that would prove most memorable. From there, Keaton enjoyed leading star-status in a fair share of notable films, including 1977’s “Looking for Mr. Goodbar” and 1981’s “Reds” opposite Warren Beatty, a film that scored multiple Oscar nods including another one for her. Another classic film starring Keaton from the ’80s era was 1987’s “Baby Boom,” which featured her as a high-powered ad exec who suddenly finds herself saddled with the infant of a dead long-lost relative. The fish-out-of-water comedy costarred Sam Shepard and reminded audiences of Keaton’s deft skills at leading a movie that mixed the funny with the dramatic and thought-provoking. The 1990s saw Keaton team up with her contemporary Hollywood powerhouses Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn for the hit 1996 comedy “First Wives Club,” about a trio of women who exact artful revenge on their husbands after the men leave them for younger women. Raking in $181 million at the domestic box office, “First Wives” was welcome proof that a successful film didn’t exclusively have to include explosions or aliens, and could even be led by three women in their 50s. Later in the decade, Keaton earned a third Oscar nom for the tearjerker “Marvin’s Room,” in which she starred opposite Meryl Streep and Leonardo DiCaprio. The film tells the story of an estranged pair of sisters who reunite to grapple with their past as well as the onset of illness. Keaton was featured in several more acclaimed movies in the aughts – including the 2003 rom-com “Something’s Gotta Give” opposite Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves, in which she scored her fourth lead actor Academy Award nod – as well as “The Family Stone” from 2005, a modern-day Christmas classic with Keaton in the role of a matriarch who unwittingly helps her children find the partners they belong with. More recently, she appeared in “Book Club” in 2018, alongside Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen, as well as its 2023 sequel. She also starred in the comedy “Summer Camp” alongside Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard last year and had a few titles in the works – including a film with Blake Lively and Richard Gere, according to her IMDb. Keaton was also an accomplished producer and director. She helmed the acclaimed 1995 drama “Unstrung Heroes” starring Andie MacDowell, as well as “Hanging Up” in 2000. Her producing credits span over 30 years, with the most recent being an executive producer credit on 2023’s “Maybe I Do,” which starred Keaton, Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Emma Roberts. Keaton never married, and had been outspoken about her thinking on the topic, saying it goes back to her mother, as “most everything does.” “She had four kids, and I was the firstborn. I saw how much she gave up,” Keaton said in a 2021 piece for Interview. “I feel like she chose family over her dreams. And she was just the best mother, but I think that she is the reason why I didn’t get married. I didn’t want to give up my independence.” With her trademark humor, Keaton added, “By the way, no one has ever asked me to marry them, either, so that might be a good answer. I should’ve started with that and called it a day.” Keaton is survived by her two children, daughter Dexter, and son Duke. She adopted them both in her 50s. “The shocking thing is that I worry differently now,” Keaton told Life Magazine in 2005 about how motherhood changed her. “Before kids, if I worried, it was only about myself, but that’s all you do is worry as a parent. It’s rule number one in parenting: secretly worry without letting the kids know you’re worried.” When she was 69, Keaton told AARP Magazine, “At this age, everything seems much more astonishing. Like, Oh my goodness, look at that sycamore tree! Why didn’t I see that before? There’s a magical aspect, a wonder, to being on this planet.”", "tags": ["dee", "dame", "hollywood", "dead", "diane"]},
{"content": "The , a large bird of prey with an unusual diet consisting primarily of bones, has long fascinated ornithologists. But now, a new study has shown why the bone-eating birds could be even more intriguing than once thought. Their carefully crafted nests, serving multiple generations, may also act as “ ,” preserving centuries-old cultural artifacts, according to scientists. In Spain, researchers studied a dozen bearded vulture nests between 2008 and 2014. The team analyzed them layer by layer, uncovering over 200 human-made objects that the birds may have repurposed as building materials. Carbon dating of these items revealed that the nests date back to at least the 13th century, with the oldest artifact being a sandal that’s over 700 years old. The findings were published September 11 in the . “We knew that the bearded vulture is a transporting species that can carry objects to its nest for construction, but we were surprised by the number of objects found and their age,” said lead author Antoni Margalida, an ecologist at the Pyrenean Institute of Ecology at the Spanish National Research Council in Jaca, Spain. “This means that these sites, used for centuries, are quality locations that different generations have used for breeding.” Not only does the research open new avenues for finding cultural artifacts, but it could also help future conservation efforts for the species, the scientists said. The bearded vulture is the only known vertebrate to specialize in eating bones, comprising up to . As the study authors set out to find historical nests — sites no longer in use either due to local extinction or unsuitable habitat factors — they were primarily interested in finding bone remains. The team aimed to study the past inhabitants’ diet and compare it with the diet of modern birds today. But the researchers said stumbling upon the copious number of artifacts entangled in the historical nests took them by surprise. Over 9% of the specimens pulled from the structures were human-made. Besides the sandal, which was crafted from woven twigs and grasses, other items found within the nests included a painted piece of medieval leather that resembles a mask, remnants of a basket dated to the 18th century, an arrow from a crossbow, ropes and rigging for horses, and more. The sandal is the oldest artifact so far, but the study team has yet to carbon-date other items, Margalida said. The documented findings offer an intriguing look into human culture, according to Margalida. “This can give us information about how people dressed, how they hunted (through the slingshots and crossbows found), and which domestic and wild species were most abundant in the ecosystem,” he said. Because bearded vultures, which have a nearly 10-foot (3-meter) wingspan, like to nest in cliff caves or rocky areas that have stable temperatures and humidity, bone remains, human-made objects and other nest materials can stay relatively well-preserved, according to the research. “This study sheds new light, and really a whole new angle on the place of the Bearded Vulture in our understanding of the interplay between a fascinating bird and the history of human culture,” John Fitzpatrick, director emeritus for the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, said in an email. “The fact that Bearded Vultures are now recognized as ‘recording artists’ documenting human history just adds to their unique mystique,” he added. Fitzpatrick, who is also professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University, was not involved with the new research. In southern Spain, where the researchers recovered the nests, bearded vultures have been locally extinct for 70 to 130 years, according to the study. To find the nest sites, the study authors spent years looking into historical records as well as speaking with older residents of the area who remember the birds when they were around. Today, bearded vultures in areas of Europe, Asia and Africa, but they are less common and widespread than they once were centuries ago. “While this research occurred in Spain, the Bearded Vulture has a broad distribution over the Old World — including in the Himalayas, the Caucasus, and the Ethiopian highlands,” said Evan Buechley, a researcher on raptor ecology and vice president of conservation for international programs with The Peregrine Fund, a nonprofit that aims to conserve birds of prey worldwide. Studying other nests, such as those in Ethiopia or Tibet, “could reveal fascinating insights into the human histories of other mountainous regions of the world,” he added in an email. Buechley was also not involved with the study. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List categorized the bearded vulture in 2014 as . By studying the birds’ nests, including those that are no longer in use, researchers can better understand factors that make habitats suitable, such as the basis of their diet or the effects of pesticides in the area, Margalida said. In addition, understanding the species’ historical factors, such as their breeding distribution and diet, could help researchers decide where and how to reintroduce the species in future projects, Buechley said. The research also highlights the large effect humans have on wildlife. Buechley pointed to the . This New World vulture is a species that faces issues with its chicks ingesting trash brought back to the nests by their parents. “This underscores the importance of maintaining vast areas of wild habitat that remain largely free of some of the worst toxins that humans create and leave around the landscape for curious critters — even as big and rock-solid as Bearded Vultures — to play with and take home,” Fitzpatrick said. “Bearded Vulture is already a revered bird bearing a special place in the hearts and minds of people who know about it,” he added. “Anything that informs the public about the fascinating ways in which wild birds and human culture intersect has huge value, both for our own appreciation of the extraordinary world around us and for our commitment to ensure the long-term protection of wild species and wild places.” Taylor Nicioli is a freelance journalist based in New York.

{"content": "In the hours after a chaotic confrontation in Chicago last week that culminated with a federal agent , top White House aide delivered an urgent order to Department of Defense personnel: Prepare to send in the troops. The facts on the ground at the time remained murky. Federal officials claimed local police were refusing to provide backup as they struggled to maintain control of the scene. The Chicago Police Department said otherwise, insisting officers were immediately sent to help out. But inside a West Wing that had waffled for weeks over the momentous step of dispatching National Guard to the nation’s third-largest city, it offered a clear impetus, two sources familiar with the discussions said. “Domestic terrorism and seditious insurrection,” Miller labeled the scene in a social media post, as administration officials hurried to draw up a deployment plan in a matter of hours. The abrupt decision to send the National Guard into Chicago has ratcheted tensions between the White House and Democratic-led Illinois to new heights in the days since. It’s opened a volatile new front in President Donald Trump’s offensive in blue cities, while further testing the limits of his rapidly expanding authority. And at the center of the controversial operation is Miller — the White House deputy chief of staff for policy who has accumulated such sprawling influence over the administration’s activities that he’s often referred to in Trump circles simply as “the prime minister.” The 40-year-old immigration hardliner has spearheaded the federal government’s increasing encroachment into Democratic cities, marshaling federal law enforcement forces behind the scenes to carry out deportation raids and coordinate crackdowns that have put residents on edge and left local elected officials scrambling to respond. Now, as the administration tries to expand its presence in over the objections of local leaders, Miller has taken on a far more public and pugilistic role — casting the effort as an existential showdown against American demonstrators and officials he’s branded as domestic terrorists for impeding his mass deportation campaign. “The struggle that is taking place right now is between the lawful exercise of power by the American people through a duly elected government, versus the unlawful exercise of street violence in the form of domestic terrorism,” Miller told reporters earlier this week. “We see this playing out over and over and over.” In a flurry of television appearances, interviews and social media posts, Miller has escalated his rhetoric to newly incendiary levels, attacking judicial orders blocking the Guard’s deployment as a “ ” and arguing that Trump should have largely unfettered power to direct troops where he wants within the country. In an interview on CNN on Monday, Miller drew particular attention for referring to Trump’s “plenary authority” — a term that refers to unlimited power — before pausing when a technical glitch caused a different CNN channel’s audio to begin playing in his in-ear monitor. A senior White House official said that was meant to refer to powers reserved to the president, and ones that the judiciary could not “second guess.” “The president has plenary authority to conduct his role as commander in chief, which includes, for example, the decision to call up the National Guard into federal service,” the official said. Miller has portrayed protesters in Chicago and Portland as violent threats to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, suggesting the cities, with minimal evidence, are overrun with left-wing agitators engaged in a coordinated rebellion against the federal government. Miller has seized in particular on last week’s shooting in Chicago, which Homeland Security officials characterized as a “defensive” response to drivers ramming a Customs and Border Protection agent’s car. The woman who was shot, Marimar Martinez, has . Judges are still weighing whether to block Trump’s deployment of the National Guard, in a legal battle that the senior White House official said was expected, but which the administration believes it will ultimately win in the appellate courts. In the meantime, Miller has vowed to find other ways to circumvent any restrictions if needed — raising the prospect that the White House could invoke the Insurrection Act to grant Trump sweeping powers to federalize the National Guard and dispatch the military into American cities. “They are actually, as we speak, trying to overthrow the core law enforcement function of the federal government,” Miller said in the interview with CNN. “It’s absurd, it’s unconstitutional and must be put down.” The dark overtones have set Miller at odds with elected officials in those cities who accuse ICE and other federal agents of being the ones provoking confrontation, and with judges who have repeatedly determined that the situation on the ground bears little resemblance to the administration’s characterizations. Even within Trump’s orbit, Miller’s forcefulness has surprised advisers who had long grown accustomed to his strident views, according to three people familiar with the dynamics, with some privately worrying that his militant language risks turning Americans against Trump on the crime and immigration issues where he’s traditionally held an advantage. Yet allies say Miller’s harsh offensive is also a strategic one, rooted in a broader effort to catapult the administration’s portrayals of out-of-control crime into the public consciousness — and build support for a maximalist Trump agenda that relies heavily on exercising his executive authorities. “There’s full comfort with him being on the air and driving the message,” said one of the people familiar with White House dynamics. “He’s not a matinee idol. But he’s a very effective messenger for what the president’s trying to do.” In a sign of Trump’s approval, the president and other senior officials have adopted Miller’s heated rhetoric in recent days. After Miller on Monday characterized Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker as providing “aid and comfort” to protesters he called domestic terrorists, Trump later Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson to be jailed. “I’ve seen the law, and when you have a group of people where the police call off the safety for ICE officials — I’ve understood that, and I’ve read it today in numerous journals — that that’s illegal,” Trump said on Wednesday. “And the governor knew.” In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised Miller as “one of President Trump’s most trusted and longest serving aides for a reason — he delivers.” The White House also noted that Miller’s vast purview as deputy chief of staff for policy as well as homeland security adviser naturally grants him a role in executing on all of Trump’s policy priorities, and that he regularly coordinates with a range of Cabinet secretaries including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Still, within the administration, officials say Miller has emerged as a singular driving force behind a constellation of initiatives meant to assert greater federal power to shape large swaths of US policy and society. The anti-immigration focus that drove his ascension in Trump’s first term has since widened well beyond the southern border to include mass deportation efforts across the country, due in large part to his secondary role as homeland security adviser. The position grants him a seat on the White House Homeland Security Council, which has taken on far greater prominence than in past administrations. From that perch, Miller has grown deeply involved in the sweeping range of anti-immigration and anti-crime initiatives underway across government. In addition to Chicago and Portland, the White House is in talks with Louisiana state officials about dispatching the Guard to New Orleans, the senior White House official said. Those efforts come on top of an already wide-ranging portfolio that Miller manages as deputy chief of staff for policy, including coordinating several unprecedented investigations into universities and cultural institutions. And in recent weeks, he’s taken up a fresh anti-crime push supercharged by the assassination of , a close Miller ally whose murder has spurred investigations Democratic donors and groups that officials claim are fueling left-wing violence. “We’re deploying the full might of the federal law enforcement to crack down on antifa and other domestic terrorist organizations, led by Stephen Miller,” Bondi said during a White House event on Wednesday. Miller’s reach has extended even into foreign policy as well, where multiple current and former officials described him as the leader, alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of a counter-drug mission that has carried out lethal strikes in the Caribbean on vessels the administration unilaterally deems to be trafficking drugs. It was Miller, not Hegseth, who led the internal push earlier this year to use the military , one source familiar with the process told CNN. Pentagon officials now routinely present Miller and Rubio with operational options and relevant data. They then decide what to do with it and work directly with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine to execute their military plans, said the source, who characterized the two men as far more involved than Hegseth in deciding how the military is used. That deep involvement in the minutiae of initiatives across the government has prompted grumbling at times among a contingent of detractors uncomfortable with the immense power wielded by a single senior staffer — though few are willing to air their criticisms in public for fear of inviting his wrath. “I don’t fault him for trying, but just because he tried doesn’t mean it’s legitimate,” retiring North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said of Miller’s persistent advocacy for norm-breaking initiatives like the National Guard deployments, even after courts have intervened. Miller made some effort in recent years to build relationships on Capitol Hill with a selection of like-minded lawmakers. But he’s with what two GOP Hill sources described as a go-it-alone attitude that’s prioritized the administration’s scorched-earth deportation tactics with little regard for the political fallout that members are then forced to manage. One group of center-right Republicans, known as the Main Street Caucus, sat down with Miller over dinner in early September to press him for more details of his deportation strategy – and why he seemed to be diverging from the White House’s plan to go after violent criminals, one of those sources said. Those members received little in the way of clarity. Yet even among Trumpworld critics who have wielded the “prime minister” moniker more as an insult than a compliment, there is grudging respect at Miller’s ability to steadily work his way into the small circle of Trump’s most-trusted advisers by — as he’s described it to others — remaining completely dedicated to implementing Trump’s vision, no matter where that goes. Even when Miller is not in the room with Trump, the president will often hold off on making final decisions before soliciting his input, one of the people familiar with White House dynamics said. And while no one in Trump’s vicinity is ever regarded as untouchable, advisers and allies described Miller as perhaps the closest one to it. The result is a growing mindmeld between Trump and Miller, they said, that has bent the administration’s agenda in increasingly hardline ways — and thrust Miller to the fore in its execution.

{"content": "The long wait is over. After years of planning and myriad delays, the European Union’s Entry/Exit system (EES) will go live on October 12. While nothing has changed when it comes to the rules of who can enter the EU, and how long they can stay, the new system will track cross-border movements in the Schengen area of 29 countries. This will be done by capturing the biometric data of visitors — just as other countries, including the US, already do. How will it work, and how could it impact your vacation? Here’s all you need to know. The EU’s Entry/Exit System will capture biometric data from non-EU citizens entering the Schengen area (essentially all EU states except Cyprus and Ireland, plus Switzerland, Iceland and Norway). In the same way that visitors are fingerprinted entering the US, travelers to the EU will be fingerprinted when they enter the bloc — and again, when they leave. The aims are two-fold: to reduce crime and illegal cross-border movement, but also to ensure that visitors are not overstaying their welcome. Third-party nationals, as non-EU citizens are termed, are only allowed to spend 90 out of every 180 days in the bloc. The system should be simple, checking faces and fingerprints against the biometric data already on record. But creating the record will be a little more time-consuming. The first time a traveler encounters the system, they will have their photo and fingerprints taken, and passport data recorded. Border points across Schengen have already installed lines of self-service kiosks for travelers to register. Once registered, on subsequent visits, your photo and fingerprints will be checked against what is already on the system. If you have a biometric passport and there are E-gates at your border crossing, you should be able to enter with that. Not at first. To avoid the logistical logjams that had been predicted, the rollout is being staggered. Each member state can decide where and how they want to implement the system. The only requirements are that at 30 days in, countries must be registering 10% of travelers. By 90 days, they should be registering 35% of travelers, rising to 50% at 150 days. By day 180, on April 9, countries must be registering all travelers in the system. At least one border crossing point in each EU country will need to have the system operational from October 12. The European Commission advises that member states roll it out at various crossing points by sea, air, and land. Outside that guidance, countries are free to implement it as they want. Your fingerprints and a photo of your face will be captured. Also recorded will be your passport information (full name and date of birth), the dates and places of entry and exit into Schengen. If you were refused entry that will also be noted. You’ll also be asked where you’re staying, and whether you have funds to cover your trip. Officials are trying to minimize delays by rolling out implementation gradually, according to an EU official. However, they warn, “there might be some delays at the beginning.” Self-service kiosks at entry points to register your initial details should help make things faster. Not quite yet. Because the system is rolling out over the next six months, your passport will still be stamped at border crossings — even if you’ve gone through EES. That’s so that crossings not yet using the technology can still keep track of your days in the EU. Once the system is fully effective, which should be on April 9, the passport stamps will end. It’ll be recorded on the system and visible at any future entry points. The information will be stored for three years, so if you travel regularly into Schengen it will keep renewing. However, if you don’t travel in the next three years, you’ll need to reregister the next time you travel to the EU. There are strict rules on how your data is handled — see the for full details. You won’t need to reregister, says an EU spokesperson. Since your biometric details will already be in the system, the system will simply be updated with your new passport number. No, because the EU already has your biometric data. The same goes for EU residents, regardless of their nationality. Legal residents will already have had their biometric data captured as part of the residency process. The full list of those exempt from EES is . Children under 12 do not have to provide fingerprints but do have to go through the rest of the process. Yes. Since Brexit, British citizens are counted as third-party nationals along with the rest of the world. The only exception is for Brits who are legally resident in the EU, or covered by the Withdrawal Agreement. If you’re not great at math, there’s a handy official calculator .

{"content": "For most of her life, Sanae Takaichi has loved heavy metal. Since drumming in a college band, the 64-year-old politician has remained a fan of groups like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden. She used to play so hard that she carried four pairs of sticks as back-up in case they snapped, Japanese media has reported. But unlike most metalheads who mellow with age, the woman likely to be Japan’s next prime minister is still an enthusiast. She has an electric drum set at home and bangs out songs whenever she’s stressed, usually about her husband. “I play after he goes to sleep,” she joked during a recent interview with a Japanese YouTuber. That same headbanging energy has defined her steady, albeit unconventional, political rise. The staunch conservative and longtime lawmaker won Japan’s ruling party’s presidency , becoming the first woman ever to secure the post, after her third attempt. But with her coalition prospects in doubt, and the party weakened by scandal and voter frustration, her route to Japan’s top job is far from assured. Days after winning the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership, a victory that would normally all but guarantee the premiership, Takaichi was dealt an unexpected setback. The LDP’s longtime coalition partner, Komeito, announced it would not join a government under her, citing lingering mistrust over an LDP political slush fund scandal. The split leaves Takaichi scrambling to secure enough parliamentary support to form a stable administration. And even if she does become Japan’s first woman prime minister, she will inherit a daunting list of challenges. Takaichi has long championed conservative policies, rooted in nationalist and traditionalist ideals. Her win, a surprising triumph in Japan’s deeply patriarchal political system, signals to disillusioned LDP voters that traditional conservatism is alive and well. A prominent member of the ultranationalist lobby group Nippon Kaigi, she promotes a patriotic education. She’s also supported revising Japan’s pacifist constitution, particularly Article 9, which renounces war and bans military forces. Unlike many of her male peers, Takaichi doesn’t come from a political dynasty. She was born in Nara prefecture to a father who worked for a car company and a mother who was a police officer. Before entering politics, she interned for a US Democratic congresswoman and worked as a TV commentator, “wearing miniskirts, riding motorcycles and presenting herself in a lively, unconventional way that sharply contrasted with the typical older male commentators,” Hajime Kidera, a professor at Meiji University’s School of Political Science and Economics, told CNN. But Takaichi gave up her beloved Kawasaki Z400GP motorcycle after becoming a lawmaker in 1993 at age 32, reportedly to avoid accidents that could hinder her work. Her first stint in politics was as an independent lawmaker in Japan’s parliament. Around that time, she met the hairdresser who’d style her hair for the next three decades. From the start, Yukitoshi Arai told CNN, Takaichi aspired to be like Margaret Thatcher. When Arai learned Takaichi had won the LDP leadership, he said, “I was so happy it gave me goosebumps.” He fondly recalled how, after early political struggles, Takaichi joined the LDP in 1996. “We decided to express her renewed determination with her hair and cut it short,” he said. Thus was born the iconic “Sanae cut” – sleek, sharp and practical for a busy politician. Since joining the LDP, Takaichi has been re-elected nine times. She’s held multiple cabinet posts, including on gender equality and demographic issues, and chaired the party’s Policy Research Council. Most recently, she served as minister of economic security under the administration of Fumio Kishida. Takaichi married in 2004. In a recent interview, she said she agreed to marry her husband, a fellow LDP lawmaker, without ever going on a date. He proposed over the phone, saying he’d had his eyes on her “for some time.” His audacity and her rashness might surprise some. But her husband was a catch, she said – he’s a trained chef. “He told me, ‘You’ll never go a day without eating good food.’ So, I just took the plunge,” she laughed, admitting she’s not much of a cook herself. Japan’s economic and demographic woes pose immediate challenges for Takaichi, should she become Japan’s next prime minister. The country’s declining birthrate means a shrinking workforce saddled with supporting a swelling elderly population. Record high inflation and a weak yen are also squeezing households and driving up living costs. Soon after her election, the yen hit a new low amid expectations of major fiscal stimulus. Takaichi has floated large-scale spending and low inflation under her own banner, “Sanaenomics,” echoing her mentor Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics.” “That kind of talk can weaken the yen further and raise concerns about Japan’s debt levels. For ordinary people already struggling with rising prices, it’s also a serious worry,” Kidera, the politics professor from Meiji University, said. Trade relations with Washington could prove tricky, particularly over a announced in September, which Takaichi has previously said she could revisit. As it stands, Japan’s investment in the US targets sectors like semiconductors, energy, pharmaceuticals and shipbuilding, while also purchasing $8 billion annually in US agricultural products. In return, the US has reduced tariffs on Japanese goods, including cars, to a baseline of 15%. With few details about the $550 billion investment deal available, and given President Donald Trump’s mercurial nature, Takaichi appears to be waiting to see how it unfolds, said Rintaro Nishimura, a Tokyo-based senior associate at The Asia Group, a consulting firm. Her first test with Washington could come quickly. If Takaichi can form a coalition and Trump’s schedule allows time around the ASEAN summit, they could meet at the end of October – potentially just days into her premiership. But despite her short runway, comparisons between the two conservative leaders are already being drawn. As a protégé of Abe, who enjoyed a close rapport with Trump, Takaichi is expected to follow her mentor’s diplomatic playbook. Like Abe, Takaichi has called for sharp increases in Japan’s defense budget, a move likely to be welcomed by the Trump administration, which has urged Tokyo to approach NATO’s 5% benchmark. Geopolitics will further test her leadership. Known as a China hawk, Takaichi has previously suggested that Chinese residents in Japan have a “duty to aid Chinese espionage.” She’s also argued that Japanese war crimes have been exaggerated, and makes regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where Japan’s war dead, including convicted war criminals, are enshrined. Several of her cabinet picks have close ties to Taiwan, risking friction with Beijing, Japan’s top trading partner. Yet analysts expect her stance on visits to the Yasukuni shrine will soften in office. “In reality, Takaichi will likely follow a logic of practical diplomacy. She’ll have to tone down the anti-China rhetoric she’s shown in the past,” political analyst Nishimura told CNN. Signs of moderation have already appeared. Takaichi said she won’t visit Yasukuni during its autumn festival, likely to reassure uneasy coalition partners. Her election may also blunt the rise of that surged in July on an anti-immigration platform. During the LDP leadership race, all five candidates promised tougher measures on foreigners. But Takaichi stood out for her rhetoric, vowing to crack down on rule-breaking visitors and immigrants. She also cited unconfirmed anecdotes about tourists allegedly kicking sacred deer in her hometown of Nara, remarks that drew criticism. She later clarified she aimed to highlight the growing anxiety and anger among many Japanese about “outrageous” foreigners. At home, Takaichi must rebuild public trust after years of scandal within her party. In 2022, revelations of some LDP lawmakers’ ties to the former Unification Church hurt the party’s reputation. The following year, several lawmakers were accused of failing to report income or disclose kickbacks, deepening public frustration. Critics say Takaichi’s record on women’s rights is mixed and will be another test of her public appeal. She opposes allowing married women to keep separate surnames, and resists Still, during her 2025 campaign, she proposed tax breaks for babysitting and corporate incentives for in-house childcare, perhaps signs of a cautious shift toward more women-friendly policies. Takaichi’s rise delivers a jolt to Japan’s political landscape.

{"content": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced on Friday that the US will allow to build an Air Force facility at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, which will host Qatari F-15 fighter jets and pilots who will train alongside US troops. “The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase the lethality, interoperability,” Hegseth said during a meeting with his Qatari counterpart Saoud bin Abdulrahman al-Thani at the Pentagon. “It’s just another example of our partnership. And I hope you know, Your Excellency, that you can count on us.” The announcement of the deal comes just weeks after Trump signed an executive order for the US to guarantee the security of Qatar — a significant commitment to a non-NATO, Arab ally. Israel had bombed Qatar several days earlier as part of an operation against Hamas officials living in Doha. But sources told CNN that the plan to build the Qatari facility has been in the works for several years, dating back to the previous administration. A US official said the agreement with Qatar is routine and something the Air Force has done for decades with other partner nations including Germany and Singapore. Hegseth later on Friday wrote in a on X, “The U.S. military has a long-standing partnership w/ Qatar, including today’s announced cooperation w/ F-15QA aircraft,” emphasizing there will be no Qatari owned base in the US. But a close ally of Donald Trump, far-right activist Laura Loomer, has posted on X more than a dozen times since the deal was announced calling it “outrageous,” “an abomination,” and a “betrayal.” Hegseth praised Qatar for playing a “substantial role” in the peace talks that led to a ceasefire and hostage swap deal between Israel and Hamas, as well as the Gulf country’s support when the US struck Iranian nuclear sites in June. Qatar is also home to the largest US military base in the region at Al-Udeid. The Qatar facility specifically has been in the works for several years; a from Mountain Home Air Force Base, published while President Joe Biden was in office,  provided the results of an environmental assessment looking at the “potential impacts associated with the beddown of a US-led Qatar Emiri Air Force F-15QA squadron” at the base. The “beddown” is facilities for the training squadron’s operations, the US official said, providing space for the pilots to train, brief, do their scheduling, and more. The countries who send pilots as part of this program provide the US funds through foreign military sales to build the facilities, the official added, and the military hires community labor around the bases to build them out. The final environmental impact report published in 2022 said it was for “the beddown of 12 F-15QA permanently assigned QEAF aircraft and associated equipment, use of the Mountain Home Air Force Base airfield and special use airspace and military training routes for training, use of defensive countermeasures and ordnance, approximately 300 additional QEAF and United States Air Force personnel, and the construction and modification of facilities and infrastructure needed to support the beddown.” The report said basing and operations were expected to begin in early Fiscal Year 2024, with an initial timeline of 10 years and an option to extend further if needed. “We further welcome today’s signing of the letter of acceptance establishing a Qatar Emiri Air Force facility at Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho,” al Thani said. “This step strengthens interoperabilities, enhances joint readiness, and advances our shared defense goals.

{"content": "Joe Biden has started radiation therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer, a spokesperson for the former president told CNN. “As part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, President Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment,” the spokesperson said. The news was . A spokesperson for the former president, who turns 83 next month, did not give a timeline for the treatment. A source told CNN he began the treatment a few weeks ago. Biden’s personal office revealed in May that he had been diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. “The expectation is we’re going to be able to beat this,” Biden in his first comments about the diagnosis two weeks after he received it. “It’s not in any organ, it’s in – my bones are strong, it hadn’t penetrated. So, I’m feeling good.” He added that he started a pill regimen to treat the cancer. “Prostate cancer is very common,” Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt, a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida’s College of Medicine, who is not involved in Biden’s treatment, told CNN in May. “As we get older, most men are going to have little cancer cells in them.” Prostate cancers can be assigned a grade, known as a Gleason score, based on what the cells look like under a microscope. Biden’s office announced in May a , “the most aggressive form of prostate cancer,” Dr. Benjamin Davies, a professor of urologic oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who is also not involved in Biden’s case, told CNN at the time. Besides the Gleason score, like blood prostate-specific antigen levels, imaging tests and biopsy findings are important in determining how the cancer might behave and what treatment options would be best. Even patients with high-risk prostate cancer “can live a pretty normal life and have a good quality of life, as long as the cancer is treated,” Brahmbhatt said. That treatment is personalized to each patient and might come in several forms, such as hormone therapy, chemotherapy or radiation. The fact that Biden’s cancer had spread to the bone “is very serious and not curable,” Davies said. However, “There is some good news here in the newer hormonal and chemotherapy therapies (that have come) into this space in the past few years which have shown impressive results and extended the longevity of patients significantly.” Last month, Biden had , an operation used to remove skin cancer lesions. In that procedure, thin layers of skin are removed and examined under a microscope until the doctor sees no signs of skin cancer cells. It’s typically used to treat cancerous lesions that have returned after previous treatment, are fast-growing, or are in important areas like the face, hands or genitals. , Biden had a lesion removed from his chest, which later tested positive for basal cell carcinoma. At the time, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as Biden’s physician in the White House, said “all cancerous tissue was successfully removed” and Biden would continue “dermatological surveillance.” Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It’s slow-growing and usually curable.", "tags": ["radiation", "therapy", "prostate", "cancer", "form", "biden", "aggressive"]},

{"content": "As far as politicians go, few have earned as much respect among Palestinians as Marwan Barghouti, the most prominent Palestinian prisoner who is serving five life sentences in an Israeli jail. The former West Bank leader of the is by far the most popular political figure in the occupied Palestinian territories, even though an entire generation of Palestinians was born after he was incarcerated more than two decades ago. Some have described him as the Palestinian Nelson Mandela, a long-time jailed leader they believe can lead them to freedom. To Israel, he is one of the most high-profile terrorists. The 66-year-old was jailed in 2002 for planning attacks that killed five civilians during the Second , or uprising. He denied the charges at the time and rejected the jurisdiction and legitimacy of the court that sentenced him. Hamas is now demanding Barghouti’s release as part of a potential – a move that could reshape the Palestinian political landscape. Given his prominence among Palestinians and his perceived ability to lead them toward statehood, Israel is highly unlikely to agree to his release. Palestinian factions tried to secure his release on multiple occasions, including in previous ceasefire negotiations during the current war. But Israel has refused to consider releasing Barghouti. Barghouti’s son, Arab Bargouthi, told CNN’s Becky Anderson in August that Israel didn’t want to release his father because Netanyahu “doesn’t want a partner for peace.” Having been immensely popular when he was jailed over two decades ago, Barghouti is still seen by many as a leader – perhaps the only one – capable of uniting Palestinians. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) is plagued by corruption and severe Israeli restrictions that and under severe financial strain. “He is perceived by the public as a national hero, a man of integrity, not tainted by corruption. A unifier who can reconcile with Hamas and unify the ranks of all Palestinians,” Khalil Shikaki, the director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, told CNN. Shikaki, who has been tracking Palestinian public opinion for decades, said Barghouti is by far the most popular Palestinian leader and the only secular nationalist capable of winning elections. “All of the other presidential candidates, Islamists and nationalist alike, cannot defeat him,” he said, adding that Barghouti would likely win at least 60% of the popular vote in an election. Shikaki said Barghouti is seen as a “realist” but is “a tough negotiator who would make a credible peace with Israel based on a two-state solution, one that can receive support from the majority of the Palestinians.” His release, Shikaki said, would mark a major victory for Hamas, and would likely shift the mood among Palestinians to one of optimism and lead to increased activism. “He would be seen as the successor to Abbas. Demand for Abbas’ resignation would increase significantly,” he added, referring to PA President Mahmoud Abbas, who has clung to power for 20 years and is seen by critics as lacking democratic legitimacy. That’s also why Israel is likely to strongly oppose his release. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant , and his polices over the years have often worked to undermine the PA, which aspires to govern a future State of Palestine. Barghouti’s career as an activist started when he was a teenager. He spent four years in prison for joining Fatah – then banned by Israel – at the age of 15, and went on to study history and political science after his release. He rose through the ranks and eventually became the Fatah secretary general in the occupied West Bank and a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the PA’s parliament. His current popularity and influence are partly down to his reputation as a charismatic politician who was able and willing to work with various Palestinian factions. He was barred by Israel for years from entering Ramallah, where he grew up, and was only able to return in 1994, after the Oslo Accords, a set of peace pacts between Israel and the Palestinians. But his time in prison has only increased his popularity. Israel essentially cut Barghouti off the outside world, his photos and videos only surfacing every few years. He has been held in solitary confinement since the start of the current Gaza war, according to his family and to the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society. The last time he was seen by the public was in a short video released by Israel’s far-right security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who was filmed taunting Barghouti in prison. His appearance – Barghouti looked frail and unwell – caused concern. Barghouti’s wife, Fadwa, said at the time that she didn’t recognize him at first and said, addressing him, that “maybe part of me doesn’t want to acknowledge everything that your face and body express.” Without mentioning Barghouti by name, a spokesman for Ben Gvir said the minister had received assurances from Netanyahu that there would be no release of what the Israeli prime minister referred to as “symbols” in any prisoner exchange with Hamas.", "tags": ["prisoner", "red", "israel", "release", "hamas", "prominent", "line", "palestinian"]},

During the initial stages of the attack outside Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue last Thursday, the assailant phoned the police “claiming to pledge allegiance to the so-called Islamic State,” a spokesperson for Counter Terrorism Policing North West said in a statement. Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian descent, was named by police as the suspected attacker. He was shot dead by firearms officers at the scene. The attack took place on , the holiest day in Judaism. Two men were killed during the attack, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said, naming them as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Both victims were from Crumpsall, the Manchester suburb where the violence took place. One of the men was likely shot by armed officers aiming for the killer, police said on Friday, adding that they believe the victim was huddled behind a door in the synagogue, trying to prevent the attacker from entering, when he was shot. “The only shots fired were from GMP’s Authorised Firearms Officers as they worked to prevent the offender from entering the synagogue and causing further harm to our Jewish community,” GMP’s Chief Constable Stephen Watson said Friday. “It follows therefore, that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end,” he added.

{"content": "leader Kim Jong Un has rolled out the red carpet for a host of foreign dignitaries, treating them to a spectacle of color and dancing, and all signs suggest he’ll also be showing off his country’s latest military hardware in a pomp-filled parade. North Korea has kept celebratory plans for the 80th anniversary of the Workers’ Party of Korea tightly under wraps – much like the secretive and isolated state has done in the past with significant dates. Images released by North Korean state media showed a huge celebration at Pyongyang’s massive May Stadium on Thursday, but the main event could be a parade in the capital Pyongyang, potentially on Friday night, involving tens of thousands of people, according to predictions from the South Korean military. The anniversary celebration comes a month after the heavily sanctioned Kim scored a major by traveling to Beijing for China’s , where he had the rare chance to stand alongside political heavyweights Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the global stage. Kim emerged from the visit with deeper strategic ties and a renewed friendship with China, North Korea’s longtime political and economic patron, as well as an his missile and nuclear weapons program. North Korea and its new military ally Russia have repeatedly affirmed their closer relationship since signing last year, and Kim has sent thousands of troops, missiles and munitions to assist Moscow’s war in Ukraine. In a show of those continued good ties, China and Russia sent delegations led notably by their number 2s to the celebrations in Pyongyang. Chinese Premier Li Qiang, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Vietnam’s Communist Party chief To Lam had front row seats as Kim kicked off celebrations Thursday with mass games and artistic performances. To much enthusiastic flag-waving, North Korea showcased a medley of traditional and patriotic songs and coordinated dances involving thousands of people, including neatly-dressed children. Impressive displays of martial arts featuring soldiers smashing cinder blocks over their bare stomachs culminated in a huge fireworks and pyrotechnics display. “Today our people are standing in front of the world as powerful beings who know no insurmountable difficulties and no unachievable cause,” Kim said in a speech, North Korean state news agency KCNA reported. Speaking to tens of thousands of spectators, Kim said that North Korea had coped with “growing nuclear war threats by the US imperialists” by simultaneously developing its “nuclear forces” and “economic construction.” “Our Party and government are still coping with our adversaries’ ferocious political and military moves of pressure by pursuing harder-line policies, holding fast to firm principles and employing brave, unflinching countermeasures,” Kim said, according to KCNA. Huge displays of carefully choreographed propaganda involving massive crowds and meticulously rehearsed performances have long been a hallmark of the North Korean regime, particularly around key anniversaries. The Workers’ Party of Korea is the sole ruling party of North Korea, blending communism with the words, sayings and ideals of the Kim dynasty, who have imposed their authoritarian rule on the country for three generations. have previously been used to showcase the country’s latest developments in advanced weaponry and missiles that, in theory, could threaten the United States. Military watchers play close attention to what Pyongyang chooses to show off at such events. Analysts have raised the possibility that North Korea’s next-generation Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), its new Hwasong-11 Ma hypersonic glide vehicle, and other advanced weapons systems may be on display. Col. Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), said last week that the military detected movements of vehicles and military equipment ahead of an expected parade. Last month, Kim of a new high-thrust solid-fueled rocket engine for its newest ICBM, the Hwasong-20. Compared with liquid-fueled missiles, solid-fueled rockets are more stable, and can be moved more easily to avoid detection before their launch, which can be initiated within minutes, experts say. Over the weekend, Kim attended an exhibition featuring some of the country’s latest weapons, including a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) equipped with a hypersonic warhead feature, labeled “Hwasong-11Ma,” according to photos released by KCNA. The Hwasong-11 series, North Korea’s variant of Russia’s Iskander missile, has an estimated maximum range of approximately 800 kilometers (497 miles). Hong Min, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said North Korea could also unveil advanced arms including AI-powered systems or various unmanned vehicles, during the parade. “The weapons shown in the parade will likely be on an unprecedented scale,” Hong said. “Rather than focusing simply on large numbers, North Korea seem to be set to prioritize revealing systems that are impactful in capability.” However, it is uncertain whether the highly anticipated Hwasong-20 will be shown, Hong added, as it hasn’t had a full launch test. Observers are watching for possible test-launches of new, next-generation weapons around the October celebrations, Hong added. Kim’s illegal nuclear weapons program has transformed North Korea into the most heavily sanctioned state in the world. In the past few years, the country has and made efforts to bolster its — including a near its northern border with China, which could pose a “potential nuclear threat” to much of East Asia and the US. Secrecy is part and parcel of North Korean parades, especially when Kim is in attendance. CNN correspondent Will Ripley attended the 70th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party exactly 10 years ago. “No one seemed to know when it would actually begin — not even our government minders. That’s how things work in North Korea: you wait for hours until someone finally tells you to move,” he said. Foreigners were sequestered to the Yanggakdo Hotel, which sits on its own island in the middle of the Taedong River in Pyongyang. “The location isn’t an accident. The island makes it easier for the authorities to control movement in and out, so guests like us can’t wander the city alone. You can look out the windows and see Pyongyang on all sides, but it might as well be another world,” Ripley said. When journalists were finally herded to the parade grounds, they went through layers of security checks. Phone and laptops had to be left behind. “When the parade began, the vast square filled with tens of thousands of people. Columns of soldiers marched in perfect step, their boots hitting the pavement with a sharp, rhythmic snap — the famous goose step,” Ripley said. North Korea has a long history of fraught relations with the United States and South Korea, but now they’re particularly icy, with Kim frequently railing against both countries. The North Korean leader last weekend said he had assigned “special assets to the major targets of our concern” and pledged to adopt additional military measures to respond to the US’s expanded military assets in South Korea. “In direct proportion to the US military’s arms buildup in… (South Korea), our strategic concern about this region has also grown,” Kim said. “The enemy, I think, will have to worry about which direction their security environment is moving in.” Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at South Korea’s Kyungnam University, said the “special assets” likely refer to “advanced strategic weapon systems encompassing tactical nuclear weapons and their delivery platforms, hypersonic missiles, and potentially AI-based drones and cyber capabilities.” Kim’s speech, which referenced South Korean security and criticized US military “buildup,” suggested “that these weapons are intended to directly threaten South Korea and US assets in the region,” Lim said. He viewed Kim’s comments as “an explicit warning that US bases and key facilities in South Korea could become potential targets of North Korean strikes.” But in contrast to his usual anti-US rhetoric, Kim that he had “fond memories” of President Donald Trump and that there is no reason to avoid dialogue with Washington — if it stops insisting his country give up its nuclear weapons. South Korea will host a major summit of regional leaders later this month and Trump is expected to attend. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is viewed as a key opportunity for Trump to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi. But his presence in the region could also put him in close proximity once again with Kim — six years after talks with Pyongyang during Trump’s last administration collapsed. Trump that he would be keen to sit down with Kim, though some say a meeting is unlikely. “I will do that, and we’ll have talks. He’d like to meet with me,” Trump claimed. “We look forward to meeting with him, and we’ll make relations better.”", "tags": ["carpet", "celebration", "north", "un", "party", "korea", "jong", "ruling", "major", "kim"]},

Boluarte has been under investigation for months over various allegations including bribery and involvement in a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2022. She has denied all allegations and refused to attend the vote on Thursday, where Congress approved her removal, citing “permanent moral incapacity” to face the onslaught of organized crime in the country. The president of Congress, 38-year-old José Jerí Oré, will act as interim president and must now call elections, under the constitution. Boluarte becomes the latest in a long line of disgraced Peruvian leaders. Since the turn of the millennium, no fewer than seven presidents have been brought to trial or faced legal challenges relating to allegations of corruption or human rights abuses. An eighth shot himself dead when police were closing in. In 2022, Boluarte became Peru’s first female president after her predecessor was arrested and impeached by lawmakers for attempting to dissolve the legislative body and install an emergency government. But since then, she has been plagued by scandal. The most serious accusations concern the deaths of more than 60 people during a crackdown by government security forces on the protests that followed Castillo’s ouster. She’s also accused of accepting Rolex watches and other jewelry as bribes, and transporting a fugitive politician in a presidential vehicle.

Signs of bullet damage were later found on the car, according to the minister, but Noboa was not hurt in the attack. CNN could not independently confirm whether shots were fired. A video released by the Ecuadorian presidency shows hundreds of people on both sides of the road, many waving arms and shouting, surging forward as the motorcade approaches. Members of the crowd throw rocks toward the vehicles, hitting and cracking some of the windows. In the background, a panicked voice can be heard warning passengers to duck. Authorities said those detained will face terrorism and attempted murder charges. “Shooting at the president’s car, throwing stones, damaging state property – that’s just criminal,” Manzano said Tuesday after formally filing a report of an assassination attempt against Noboa, according to Reuters. “We will not allow this.” This is not the first time a convoy carrying Noboa has been attacked. In September, roughly 350 people attacked a motorcade carrying the president and diplomats during a protest in Imbabura province, according to officials. Authorities said the attackers ambushed the convoy with fireworks, molotov cocktails and rocks. The attacks come amid unrest in Ecuador sparked by the government saying it would end a subsidy on diesel to reduce public spending, curb fuel smuggling and free up funds for social programs. In recent weeks, demonstrators led mostly by Ecuador’s Indigenous community have blocked roads and clashed with security forces, with one incident a week ago leaving one civilian dead and several injured. The presidency claims “terrorist groups” have infiltrated the demonstrations, but protesters argue the government is violently repressing dissent over the new fuel policy. Indigenous leaders have also accused the government of allowing unchecked mining and oil drilling on ancestral lands. Following Tuesday’s incident, national Indigenous confederation CONAIE again accused the government of violence toward demonstrators, saying in a post on X that the five detained people were protesters who – alongside elderly women – had been attacked in a “brutal police and military action.” At the weekend, the government declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces where there have been protests, citing “serious internal unrest,” but it has not prohibited peaceful demonstrations. The provinces affected have large Indigenous communities. Noboa has insisted the fuel subsidy cut is here to stay. “Those who choose violence will face the law.

What started with a plot of land that she purchased with her babysitting money has become a global model for poverty alleviation and development through her nonprofit, . “It’s really a community vision for care and what children need to thrive,” Doyne, 38, said. After high school, Doyne began her work after meeting a young girl in Surkhet, Nepal, whose life was ravaged during the country’s decades-long civil conflict. Today, Doyne cares for 93 children, addressing their immediate needs and supporting them for long-term growth and self-sufficiency. Her Kopila Valley School, once a small “bamboo shack,” has now served 1,000 students with state-of-the-art facilities, modern technology, and diverse course offerings. Students participate in gardening, farming, and conservation classes and are provided healthy meals to address malnutrition. There is an onsite daycare, as well as a job readiness program called “Futures” to launch students toward college, vocational programs, and job training. “We’ve now raised a generation of children,” Doyne said. “They are out in the world as architects, engineers, social workers, teachers, and entrepreneurs.” The Kopila Valley Children’s Home, once a one-story structure, is now a four-story Children’s Village, with a new facility set to open later this year. Doyne says her goal is to keep families together, but when that is not an option, her home offers safety, protection, and love to the most vulnerable children in the area. The organization also has a separate home for at-risk girls who have been victims of trauma, human trafficking, and violence; a food and farming program that trains Indigenous women and farmers; and a full-service medical clinic. Doyne and a team of 175 caregivers, teachers, and professionals work together to offer comprehensive services that address the roots of poverty. While Doyne’s last decade has been defined by enormous achievements, it has also come with profound heartache. On December 30, 2015, Doyne’s son Ravi died by accidental drowning. At one point, the traumatic loss made progress seem impossible. “I didn’t know if I would recover,” Doyne said. “The years following were about putting the pieces back together and really healing as a family.” At a speaking engagement in Los Angeles, Doyne connected with Jeremy Power Regimbal, a filmmaker who shared a passion for humanitarian causes and storytelling. He started documenting Doyne’s work and life story. And the two began a journey together, professionally and personally. Now married, they raise their biological children in Nepal amongst their 93 siblings. “It’s been a chapter of partnership and building this beautiful family,” Doyne said. “We are very much committed to working hand in hand with our team and our community; continuing to spread the word of helping the orphan crisis.” United by a shared mission to make a difference, Power Regimbal directed and filmed “ ,” a documentary released this year that highlights the raw and often painful realities of Doyne’s work. “It definitely lifts the veil of heroism,” Doyne said. “By showing that vulnerability, it’s inspired people in a way that I never imagined.” Hope and action are ideas that Doyne made a reality two decades ago.

{"content": "After months of delays and disappointments, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on Friday. Thousands of Palestinians have begun walking from the south of Gaza toward Gaza City in the north. The Israeli military is pulling back its forces, in accordance with the deal approved by Israel’s government overnight. US President Donald Trump announced the agreement in a short Truth Social post on Wednesday. Although the ceasefire represents a major diplomatic breakthrough for his administration, it leaves much to be decided. It is not clear whether Israel and Hamas will agree to other conditions proposed by Trump relating to thornier questions of what Gaza will look like after the war. Here’s what we know about the deal so far. The US president broke news of an agreement on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, saying it would lead to the swift release of hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed line. After a late-night government approval, the Israeli military on Friday said that the ceasefire is in effect, and that its forces had begun to withdraw to an agreed-upon line. Hamas’ chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said Thursday that the group has received guarantees from the US and international mediators confirming that this deal means “the war has ended permanently,” rather than representing a temporary ceasefire, as on previous occasions. However, it is not clear if the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office has given the order to the Israel Defense Forces to cease fire. Eyewitnesses reported Israeli airstrikes and artillery shelling in the center of Khan Younis and in Gaza City early Friday morning. Footage from a Reuters camera positioned in southern Israel also showed large plumes of smoke seen rising into the air in Gaza on Friday morning. Israel’s partial withdrawal from Gaza is expected to take fewer than 24 hours. There will also be a 24-hour window during which petitions objecting to the deal can be submitted to the Israeli High Court. Once this objection window closes, Hamas will have 72 hours to release the hostages, two Israeli officials told CNN. Another Israeli source said the assumption is that hostages will be released before these 72 hours pass. Trump said earlier that they should be released on Monday or Tuesday. Under the plan, all the living hostages are set to be released together, without any ceremony. The remains of deceased hostages must also be returned during that period. Twenty hostages are believed to be alive, with grave concerns for the well-being of two of them. A further 28 hostages are deceased. Hamas may not be able to find them all. Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said that 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences will also be released, along with 1,700 others held in Israeli jails. But an Israeli source familiar with the matter said Thursday that negotiating teams are still working on the list of prisoners to be released and that the issue “has not yet been resolved.” The source said that any prisoner convicted of murder would not be released to the occupied West Bank and that their transfer to a third country had not yet been determined. , the Palestinian political leader who has been imprisoned by Israel since 2002, will not be released, the Israeli government spokesperson said. The warring parties have still not agreed to major sticking points tackled in Trump’s released last month. Those include: Trump’s plan called for Hamas to “commit to peaceful co-existence” with Israel and lay down its arms. Hamas members who comply will be given amnesty under the plan. Disarmament has long been a red line for the militant group. The plan also called for a temporary transitional government to be established in Gaza, comprising a “technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee” made up of “qualified Palestinians and international experts” and supervised by “a new international transitional body” called the Board of Peace. Trump appeared to reference this board during an interview with Fox News, saying that his administration was “forming a council of peace” to maintain a lasting end to the conflict in the region. But it is not yet known which individuals will be appointed to these bodies, nor how it will exercise authority over Gaza. Trump’s plan also called for the creation of an “International Stabilization Force (ISF)” to be deployed to Gaza and train “vetted Palestinian police forces” in Gaza. With this force in place, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would then be expected to withdraw from Gaza. Israel has not yet agreed to these provisions. Hamas has long sought concrete assurances that Israel will not resume the war once it ends, pointing to how Israel shattered the last ceasefire agreement in March. If Hamas agrees to disarm, it is likely to demand even more robust security guarantees, but it is not clear whether Israel will agree to them. If the ceasefire holds and Israel withdraws to the agreed-upon line in Gaza, the hostages could be released Monday. That timeline is uncertain, however, and the release could happen sooner. Whereas small groups of hostages have been released each week under previous ceasefires, Trump has insisted that all hostages be released at once. Substantive discussions have not yet begun over what comes next for the war-torn Gaza Strip, with the current focus on implementation of the ceasefire and hostage-release deal, an Israeli official and another regional source told CNN. The negotiators in Egypt this week set up committees on multiple tracks to tackle the next steps in the overall plan, the regional source said. But active discussions on those topics will begin after the first phase of the deal, the source added. Implementing the full framework of Trump’s plan would likely spark a revolt among the hard-line members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition. Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, two far-right ministers, say Trump’s plan represents a defeat for Israel and could threaten government stability if the peace plan progresses. Meanwhile, Trump told Axios reporter and CNN analyst Barak Ravid that he plans to travel to Israel in the coming days. “They want me to give a speech at the Knesset,” he said.

{"content": "Russia carried out a “massive attack” on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, top Ukrainian officials said early Friday, killing at least one person and leaving parts of the capital Kyiv without power. The Kremlin appears again to be using a tactic deployed in previous years, depriving Ukrainians of power and heat ahead of the bitter winter months. Russia started attacking Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in late September, according to official reports and CNN’s assessment. The attacks have been almost daily since then, with targets including energy generating facilities, including gas production and distribution. Russia’s Ministry of Defense said in a Telegram statement Friday that it had launched a “massive” strike targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, in what it said was a response to “the terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime on civilian targets on Russian territory.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Friday’s strike “a cynical and calculated attack, with more than 450 drones and over 30 missiles targeting everything that sustains normal life, everything the Russians want to deprive us of.” “It is precisely the civilian and energy infrastructure that is the main target of Russia’s strikes ahead of the heating season,” he added. It is Russia’s “goal to leave us in darkness, without water and heat,” said the Kyiv region’s governor, Mykola Kalashnik, adding that about 28,000 families in the Brovary and Boryspil districts were without power. Power outages also affected more than 16,500 households and 800 businesses in the Poltava region, its governor Volodymyr Kogut said. A 7-year-old boy was killed in a strike on the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, and dozens more injured, according to foreign minister Andriy Sybiha. Local authorities say at least 33 people have been injured overall across the Cherkasy, Kyiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia regions. “In Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, and other regions, many people remain without power following Russian strikes on civilian energy objects,” Sybiha said. Workers were taking “all necessary measures to minimize the negative consequences,” Ukraine’s energy minister Svitlana Grynchuk said in a statement Friday. At least 12 people were injured in Kyiv during Friday’s attack, which had cut some power supplies, said the city’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko. He said that the left bank of the capital was without power, with the city also reporting water supply issues. Mykyta Varenya, a 26-year-old coffee shop owner from Kyiv, told CNN he had resorted to using a generator after the latest strikes. “The lights were out, there was no water, so I’m just getting by with a generator,” he said. “Last year, it had a big impact (on my business). We had problems with the generator at first, gasoline is expensive, and roughly speaking, you end up breaking even, or even losing money with these outages.” Pensioner Olena, 68, who only gave her first name, was one of the citizens who had queued up at a local shop to buy water after running water in her property was cut on Friday morning. “There was no water or electricity in the morning,” she said. “Today’s outage was unexpected. But I went and got some (water). I had a little, so I got a little more. We’ll survive somehow.” Video from Ukraine’s emergency service shows firefighters in Kyiv working to douse a massive blaze at a building site, and escorting residents to safety. Ukraine’s largest private energy producer, DTEK Group, said Russia targeted its stations, injuring an energy worker and severely damaging equipment. This is the third strike on DTEK’s facilities in one week, it in a statement. Ukraine’s Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said Friday that repair crews were working in all regions to bring back power after the air raid alerts had finished. The water supply should be fully restored in Kyiv and Kirovohrad region by the end of the day, she added. Svyrydenko said the attack had been one of the largest to specifically target energy infrastructure, and that a significant portion of the missiles fired had been ballistic missiles. “Unfortunately, there is significant damage to the energy infrastructure,” she said. Four people were injured in the Dnipropetrovsk region, its governor Sehiy Lysak said, adding that 60 drones were intercepted over the region. Last Christmas, were left without heating in the Kharkiv region in temperatures of 3 degrees Celsius (37 degrees Fahrenheit).

{"content": "Globally, more than 660 million people still lack access to electricity — and of them reside in sub-Saharan Africa. Washikala Malango was one of these people. Malango was born and raised in Baraka, a village on the shores of a vast lake in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). His off-grid childhood was not particularly unusual: even today, around 78% of the population in the country has no access to electricity, . He recalls spending mornings at school and afternoons playing soccer in the streets, and at dusk, returning home to share the light of a kerosene lamp in the kitchen, where his mother prepared dinner. There was no reading or studying in the evening: “We wouldn’t even buy enough kerosene to even make enough light (to last) until 9 or 10 p.m. Then you spend the rest of the night in the darkness,” he recalls. One evening, when a candle was left burning after hours, his cotton-filled mattress caught fire, and he awoke gasping through mouthfuls of smoke. In the mid-1990s, during the Congolese civil war, Malango and his childhood friend Iongwa Mashangao fled Baraka. The teenagers ended up together in a refugee camp in Tanzania, which also lacked electricity. “Relying on dirty and expensive sources of energy for lighting, for powering appliances, for learning, this had a very negative impact on our household’s income, on our health,” says Malango. These early experiences motivated Malango and Mashangao to launch in 2013, a startup that provides easy-to-install home solar kits to bring reliable electricity to off-grid communities. “We really wanted to contribute to the eradication of energy poverty in the DRC, given what we experienced growing up,” says Malango. Made up of 54 countries, Africa gets more sunshine hours than any other continent. It has some of the — the power of the sun per square meter — in the world, with “ ” potential for solar energy according to the African Development Bank. Solar has been touted as the obvious solution to provide clean energy to the millions of people living without electricity. Yet the continent had just 21.5 gigawatts of installed solar capacity in 2024, . By comparison, China, the global leader in solar power, added . What’s holding solar back in Africa? “The problem that you have in many African countries is that you have scattered, low density population centers,” says Bruno Idini, an analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA). Issues vary from country to country, but national grids often struggle to expand beyond cities due to high infrastructure costs and bottlenecks, regulatory hurdles, unclear government policies, and sometimes, conflict and unrest. When it comes to solar, these issues are compounded with the high upfront costs of large-scale farms. Multinational projects aim to address these challenges, such as the “ ” initiative, which has seen 29 nations pledge policy changes in a bid to improve energy access in the region and connected 30 million people so far. One of the most ambitious projects is the , launched in 2018. It aims to bring 10 gigawatts of solar power to 11 countries in the Sahel region — Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan — by 2030, potentially benefiting 250 million people. However, more than halfway through the project’s timeline, only a fraction of its solar capacity has been financed. Its progress has been hindered by civil unrest, including five coups over three years, with six of the project’s 11 participating nations by the World Bank in 2024. In the past two decades, Africa has seen just of global investment in renewables, despite its extensive untapped renewable resources. The IEA estimates that it would cost to bring universal electricity access to the continent by 2030 — and while investment in renewables in Africa is growing, particularly in the private sector, it still falls short of what’s needed to meet renewable targets. While utility-scale solar still dominates the sector, distributed solar is expected to account for 42% of solar PV expansion in the next five years, according to the IEA. These home solar systems and mini grids could “serve as a bridge while waiting for the grid,” says Heymi Bahar, senior renewable energy markets analyst at the IEA, and lead author of agency’s renewables report. Falling costs make solar a “no-brainer” compared to fueling diesel generators for many families, says Bahar. However, he adds that the initial upfront capital required for solar PV remains a barrier — it’s estimated that only of households without electricity can afford a “tier 1” solar kit, which equates to four hours of electricity daily — so government policies, venture capital, and seed funding environments play crucial roles in promoting solar adoption. “If there is no help from the government in terms of either financing or micro financing systems, it’s quite difficult to pay for all this upfront for many people in Africa,” says Bahar. The biggest barrier for investors in off-grid projects is “whether the grid will come or not, or when it will come — because you don’t want people to invest in a massive off-grid infrastructure, and then two years later, the grid comes,” says Bahar. Clear policies and transparent planning can “de-risk” these projects to attract external financing, he adds. In the meantime, startups like Altech are making a dent. Their business model allows customers to pay for the solar kit over several months, rather than upfront. According to the , the average daily income in the DRC is $3.92, which made even a seemingly small upfront payment of $13 for a solar lamp out of reach, says Malango. Altech introduced mobile payments in 2022, to facilitate its pay-as-you-go solar kits, ranging from entry-level lighting systems that cost around 50 cents per day over 100 days, to more comprehensive “power systems” that include products like an induction cooking stove and freezer, which cost $1 per day for five years. Malango says that the most popular solar home system includes two 50-watt solar panels, designed to support a television, radio, soundbar, fan, phone charger and two bulbs, and costs around 50 cents per day, paid over 3 years. Without the solar systems, households would spend hundreds of dollars annually to get kerosene canisters that would support basic lighting and cooking needs. Malango says that the most popular solar home system includes two 50-watt solar panels, designed to support a television, radio, soundbar, fan, phone charger, and two bulbs. On the larger systems, customers pay a small down payment and the rest over 2 to 5 years. Beyond economic savings, these off-grid solar systems improve quality of life: reliable lighting allows children to study at night and improve their educational performance, and households can reduce their exposure to from kerosene, and the negative health impacts from accidental fires and smoke inhalation. Even small things, like charging a mobile phone, become infinitely easier and cheaper, says Malango: people would typically go to diesel generator-powered charging shops, spending between $1-$3 to charge their phone, which could also be lost or stolen during charging. “Now they can charge at their own place, anytime, so it has also helped a lot,” adds Malango. To date, the company has reached over 2.5 million people in the DRC. Decentralized energy solutions like Altech are becoming increasingly important in the quest for energy equity. According to the IEA, around a quarter of electricity connections in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2022 were provided by off-grid solar systems. Other enterprises across the continent are also filling the gaps in the main grid: Kenyan startup M-Kopa was one of the first in the pay-as-you-go solar sector in 2011, and has since successfully pivoted its business expanding into digital finance, smartphones and e-mobility. , formerly Baobab+, raised over $21 million for its operations in Nigeria, Senegal, Madagascar, and Ivory Coast, where it’s brought solar kits and off-grid cooking stoves to 2 million people and counting. In South Africa, provides micro-financed solar kits repaid over three years. And Congolese startup , which means “light” in Swahili, focuses on solar mini grids for remote communities. In 2023, it secured to build the largest mini grid in sub-Saharan Africa. These off-grid energy solutions are often providing “first time access to African households,” which given the continent’s large youth demographic – — can help provide opportunities for the next generation, says IEA analyst Idini. “It’s sort of a vicious cycle — you don’t have power because you cannot pay for it, but you cannot pay for it because you don’t have power,” says Idini. “That’s where solar home systems and mini grids can play a very big role.”", "tags": ["solar", "africa", "help", "unlimited", "grid", "light", "continent", "potential", "power"]},
{"content": "North Korea showed off a new hypersonic glide vehicle and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) at a military parade late Friday, as it marked 80 years of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. The Hwasong-11Ma hypersonic weapon and the Hwasong-20 ICBM, which state media called North Korea’s “most powerful nuclear strategic weapons system,” were among an arsenal of North Korean weaponry featured in the overnight parade in Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Square. The celebration came a month after leader Kim Jong Un scored a major by traveling to Beijing for a , where he had the rare chance to stand alongside global heavyweights on the global stage, namely Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kim emerged from the visit with deeper strategic ties and a renewed friendship with China, North Korea’s longtime political and economic patron, as well as an his missile and nuclear weapons program. Since that meeting in Beijing, state media has featured reports of new or improved North Korean weapons systems – among them the Hwasong-11Ma, with a maneuverable hypersonic warhead, and the Hwasong-20. The Hwasong-11Ma was first seen at a military exposition in Pyongyang a week ago. The weapons of the Hwasong-11 series are short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) based on Russia’s Iskander missiles, which have seen extensive use in Moscow’s devastating strikes across Ukraine. North Korea appears to have fitted the new 11Ma model with a warhead carried in a boost glide vehicle, essentially a flattened and finned glider that enables the warhead to take an erratic course to its target, making it difficult for defenders to spot and defensive missiles to hit. It’s called hypersonic because it can make these maneuvers while traveling at more than five times the speed of sound. The Kim regime has been testing hypersonic glide vehicles since at least September 2021. But used a solid-fueled booster rocket, as opposed to liquid-fueled ones in earlier tests. Solid-fueled rockets can be moved more easily and fired more quickly – in a matter of minutes – than liquid-fueled versions, making them harder to defend against. North Korea may have benefitted from lessons its ally Russia has learned using the air-launched version of the Iskander missile – the Kinzhal – in Ukraine. But a number of analysts have been skeptical of Russian claims about the effectiveness of the Kinzhal, according to an August report from the US Congressional Research Service. Earlier this year, North Korea announced that that would power the missile had passed final testing. Meanwhile, the appearance of the nuclear-capable Hwasong-20 was the first for North Korea’s newest ICBM. It’s possible that what was seen in the military parade was only a cannister believed to carry the weapon, atop an 11-axle transporter-launch vehicle, as Pyongyang has not yet announced flight tests. That engine, which is solid-fueled and made of carbon fiber composite materials, has been tested nine times on the ground, according to North Korean state media. KCNA said the engine would also be used on the Hwasong-19 ICBM, which has been flight-tested and which experts believe has the range to hit anywhere in the United States. The ICBM appeared to be the last to rumble through Kim Il Sung Square on the the night. “The spectators broke into the most enthusiastic cheers when the column of Hwasong-20 ICBMs, the most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system of the DPRK, entered the square, filling the track,” KCNA reported, using the initials for the country’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. While new missiles were what Western observers were eager to get a look at, the parade also featured upgraded main battle tanks, dubbed the Cheonma-20. The tanks, with “tremendous striking capability and (a) reliable protection system, passed through the square with the will to annihilate the enemies,” state media reported. Also in the parade formations were North Korean troops who fought against Ukraine, helping to expel Kyiv’s forces from the Kursk region of Russia earlier this year.

{"content": "In Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, reigns supreme. Banners proclaiming “We love Trump” offer effusive thanks to the US president. For the families of the kidnapped by Hamas in Gaza, and the crowds who supported their struggle over two years, the narrative is clear: with the imminent return of the hostages, Trump delivered what wouldn’t. Or couldn’t. For months, the accusation against the Israeli prime minister has been consistent. The hostage families and Netanyahu’s political opponents believe he prolonged for his political survival. The military campaign appeased his far-right coalition partners, who called to expand Israel’s assault on Gaza and dreamed of fully re-occupying the territory. “Netanyahu isn’t willing to pay the political price of bringing back all the hostages,” opposition leader Yair Lapid charged last December. But the landscape shifted dramatically with Trump’s return to the White House early in 2025. Netanyahu has described Trump as the best friend Israel has ever had in the Oval Office. The prime minister previously scored political points feuding with democratic administrations in the United States. He wouldn’t dare do that with Trump. And Trump has used that leverage when he needs to. In January, the US president exerted decisive pressure on Netanyahu to accept a deal that brought 30 of the living hostages and eight deceased hostages home. It was Joe Biden’s ceasefire plan, but Trump pushed Netanyahu to accept. In June, during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, Trump ordered Israel to call off an imminent airstrike, posting an order on Truth Social: “BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME NOW.” The fighter jets turned around in mid-air. Last week, Trump’s leverage was on display again as he forced Netanyahu into an unprecedented apology to Qatar over the failed September 9 strike on Hamas leaders in Doha. The apology included a humiliating visual of the call from the Oval Office which was posted on social media for the world to see. Then Trump announced his ambitious 20-point plan to end the war entirely during Netanyahu’s Washington visit. After Hamas said it was ready to negotiate, Trump explicitly directed Israel to halt bombing in Gaza, while deeming the US-designated terrorist organization as “ready for lasting peace.” Then he dispatched his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner  to Cairo to secure a deal, and finally announced on Wednesday night that “peace” is underway, with all 48 remaining hostages  expected to be released  under the agreement’s first phase. Netanyahu, for his part, repeatedly rejects claims that he succumbed to US pressure. He tried to frame the ceasefire deal as a milestone of unprecedented strategic coordination, selling it as “one of our great achievements” in a two-year war that has wrought devastation and more than 67,000 deaths in Gaza, according to authorities there. “Anyone who says that this hostage deal was always on the table is simply not telling the truth,” he said in a televised statement on Friday. Contrary to previous Hamas demands, Trump’s plan ensures the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) maintains a presence over roughly half of the embattled enclave. Netanyahu pitches this as a win : hostages returned, IDF holding ground, Hamas weakened. Yet it falls short from the “total victory” he pledged for two years. The first phase leaves Hamas armed and operational, doesn’t guarantee disarmament or leadership exile, and Gaza’s post-war governance remains undefined. Yet the man who was cornered into a ceasefire may have also been granted an escape route from a protracted, unpopular war ahead of the Israeli elections set for next year. According to two Israeli officials, Netanyahu was one of the authors of Trump’s 20-point proposal. According to these officials, after Israel’s short  war with Iran in June, Trump and Netanyahu agreed, “Once Iran was hit, Gaza had to end.” While negotiators shuttled to Doha for another round of failed talks, Netanyahu’s closest confidant, Ron Dermer, worked parallel channels with the Trump administration and Gulf states on what eventually became Trump’s ceasefire blueprint. “The final plan is full of Dermer’s fingerprints,” one of the sources said, while admitting that in the final stretch Trump imposed terms Netanyahu had to accept, including a potential pathway to a Palestinian state. Critically, Netanyahu appeared to structure a deal which includes his favorite escape hatch. Trump’s grandiose peace plan still ended up phased and conditional – granting the Israeli leader political leeway with his hardline coalition. Full IDF withdrawal is contingent on Hamas disarmament, according to the agreement, a deliberately ambiguous trigger that Netanyahu says preserves Israel’s freedom to resume fighting, while Hamas officials claim they have US assurances that the war will not resume. As veteran Israeli journalist Nahum Barnea wrote on Friday in Yedioth Ahronoth, the agreement “has more holes than Swiss cheese” and “more willingness to agree than instructions for implementation.” This ambiguity is what keeps Netanyahu’s coalition intact, at least temporarily. Despite far-right threats to overthrow the government, right-wing ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have signaled they are staying, soothed by Netanyahu’s assurances that “the war isn’t over” and that Israel reserves the right to resume fighting if Hamas fails to disarm. Netanyahu may have been cornered to end the war, but he engineered enough wiggle room to claim that he hasn’t. His decision was also shaped by the looming political calendar. Israel’s next elections are officially scheduled for October 2026, but it appears increasingly unlikely it will be  that long. An Israeli source told CNN that “several months ago, Netanyahu realized the war had become a liability, and he didn’t want to head into elections with hostages still captive, serving as a daily reminder of the October 7 failure.” Netanyahu’s main challenge in the next election will be responsibility for the deadliest day in Israel’s history, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were kidnapped to Gaza. Two years ago, Netanyahu appeared to be politically dead, given that  catastrophic failure that happened on his watch. A majority of Israelis supported his resignation, while weekly protests have called for elections. Trump handed Netanyahu a new narrative for political redemption. Ending the war will offer the Israeli leader  relief from daily headlines of IDF casualties, strained reservist forces, increasing international isolation and severe economic damage –  heavy burdens for electoral campaigns. And as Trump repeatedly notes, the ceasefire is extremely popular. Though detailed polling on the electoral impact of the deal is pending, previous surveys repeatedly suggest 60 to 70%  of Israelis support it. “Bibi told me, I can’t believe it. Everybody’s liking me now,” Trump said in an interview to Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Wednesday, recounting a phone call with Netanyahu. “More importantly, they’re loving Israel again.” Netanyahu’s campaign is already taking shape: the war is over, the hostages are home, Iran and its proxies are degraded, and with Trump by his side, he will try to expand regional normalization. Netanyahu is keenly aware of Trump’s popularity in Israel – much greater than his own – and sources say he intends to make him central for his  election campaign. In an extraordinary move, Netanyahu invited Kushner and Witkoff to the Israeli cabinet meeting on Thursday, in which the ceasefire deal was approved. Next week, Trump himself arrives in Israel to participate in the celebrations. Netanyahu is likely to orchestrate every moment for maximum political impact and ride Trump’s popularity straight into the election. Pressure from the US might have forced Netanyahu to accept terms he spent months avoiding, yet by making Trump the story – the savior dealmaker who loves Israel – Netanyahu will try to carry out political alchemy, converting the deal into political gold. It may also distract from the prime minister’s that Trump, incidentally, has called to be thrown out. Whether Trump’s endorsement can rewrite Netanyahu’s legacy as the prime minister who presided over Israel’s worst security failure and longest war will become an ultimate test of Israeli voters’ memory.", "tags": ["trump"]},
{"content": "Ofir Braslavski is smiling for the first time in two years. It’s a stark change of face for the father of 21-year-old hostage Rom Braslavski, who hit an emotional low in August after seeing his weeping, emaciated son in footage released by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) militant group  from inside Gaza. “We focus on the kiss, the hugs, his smell,” Braslavski told CNN Saturday as he looked onto a Tel Aviv plaza known as Hostages Square – the hub of hostage demonstrations for over 700 days. “Many thoughts are running through my head,” he said, emphasizing that he was looking forward to nothing else but the reunion. Like the hundreds of people in front of him, Braslavski can’t wait for the weekend to end: Forty-eight hostages – 20 of whom are believed to be alive – are by Monday at noon under the first phase of a ceasefire plan agreed by Hamas and Israel. “Every second feels like it’s lasting forever, we’re just waiting for the moment they call us – to Re’im (the meeting point) and then to the hospital,” he said. Among the crowd, it is US President Donald to whom the admiration and thanks are directed, with signs, American flags and effigies of the American leader abundant. Trump cornered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing to the first phase of the ceasefire deal. Many hostage families have blamed the Israeli leader for prolonging the war, deflecting responsibility for the October 7 attacks, and sabotaging negotiations around the release of the hostages and an end to the war. But Braslavski isn’t interested in politics. He just wants peace – and believes it will stick, despite looming questions about the second phase of the deal, which include significant obstacles for both parties to overcome regarding Hamas’ disarmament, governance and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. “I believe that now, with everything that happened, it’ll get better, it’ll be easier,” he said. His optimism was shared among a crowd that felt more like a reunion of friends. Home-baked cookies were passed around with signs that read “Taste of Joy.” Children walked among adults who shared sweets from their pockets. Strangers became friends and friends became family in a crowd that has felt anger, despair and hopelessness before finally feeling some happiness. As Braslavski walked through the crowd, he stopped to embrace Michel Illouz – whose 26-year-old son Guy was killed in Hamas’ captivity – and who was repeatedly interrupted by the embrace of total strangers who wished to shake his hand after he gave an impromptu speech that included the last message his son sent to him from the Nova festival, where he was kidnapped. There, two fathers – one waiting on his son’s remains; another expecting his son’s embrace, stood in a uniquely Israeli moment of paradox, suspended between grief and joy. “It’s impossible to explain, this connection (between us) doesn’t exist anywhere else,” Braslavski said. “Those who lost their dear ones keep on coming here … it‘s something that’s difficult to grasp,” he added. For Illouz, who rushed to the square in jubilation Wednesday night as the deal was announced, the impending hostage release is deeply complicated. “I’m so proud to be able to meet the children who are alive, to be able to help recover the children, I’m too happy for the families,” Illouz said. “But also I’m finding a place for my sadness,” he said. “It’s a very confusing moment. It’s a nightmare actually.” As Illouz prepares for his son’s remains to return, he outlined the excruciating tasks that lie ahead. “What actually will I get … what kind of bones? How will I find the way to recognize him? I’m so afraid of that – and then, to bury him,” he said. “It’s going to be a long, long journey, that we’re just going to start,” he added. While Illouz hopes to be able to bury his son in the upcoming days, that closure is not certain. Netanyahu publicly implied for the first time Friday that not all of the held captive in Gaza will return, underscoring previous assessments that Hamas may not be able to find and return all of their remains. The Israeli government has, for months, been aware that Hamas may not know the location of – or is unable to retrieve and return – all 28 bodies. On a crowded row of steps in front of the adjacent library, Simcha Cohen was coming to terms with her own complicated feelings. Cohen, who lost her own son to suicide years ago, is part of an NGO that supports bereaved parents – a group that, before October 7, used to meet regularly in the same plaza. Simcha hadn’t returned to the square since that day in 2023, when the site became known as Hostages Square. “I am not happy yet,” she said. “Maybe it will come tomorrow when they (the hostages) are home.” But she knows that even the moments of joy to come will be spoilt by the trauma of the last two years. Through tears, she points to a photo of Roi Shalev – whose partner was killed in the Nova music festival attack in front of him – and who died by suicide on Friday, just hours after the ceasefire came into effect. Inside the library, the family of former hostage Ofer Kalderon – who was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, 2023, and released in February during the previous ceasefire agreement – were anxious for Monday to arrive. Kalderon’s sister-in-law Sharon told CNN she had “knots” in her stomach, but that she and her husband Nissan had cancelled plans with their family so that they could show up for what they hoped was one last time at Hostages Square. “We got the support of these families when Ofer returned. So we are here for them to help them, to be here, to hug them and be happy with them as they wait,” Sharon said. “We wait, we wait, we wait.”", "tags": ["israel", "grief", "joy", "awaits", "return"]},

Among those feeling the biggest squeeze who have been mired in confusion since the pandemic and amid two presidential administrations’ opposing desires for those outstanding balances. The prospects of sharply reduced monthly payments and, especially, debt forgiveness have faded; instead, those who have fallen behind on payments not only are seeing their credit scores tank as a result, but they also risk having their wages garnished by the government. Here’s a quick look at how household finances are becoming increasingly frayed: The Covid-19 pandemic upended the US economy — but in the process, some Americans were able to swiftly . Stimulus checks, payment pauses (on student loans and rents, in some cases), cutbacks in travel and other discretionary spending, as well as helped give Americans plenty of dry powder and a leg up on their debts. The shored-up savings helped to power a post-pandemic recovery, and credit card balances shot up accordingly. The record-setting balances, on their own, weren’t necessarily a troublesome indicator. Credit card use rises as the population grows, as more people shop online, and as the economy and wage gains remain strong. However, the post-pandemic recovery included a bout of that the Federal Reserve tried to combat with . Where the rubber meets the road is how people were managing those rising and costly debts. By the end of last year, Americans were having greater difficulty in managing rising debt and, in some cases, hadn’t been that overextended since the aftermath of the Great Recession. The share of households becoming seriously delinquent on their auto loans and credit cards . Moreover, at the start of this year, it was highly expected that student loan delinquencies would worsen. The 3.5-year payment pause ; however, an additional provision under the Biden administration provided a one-year “on-ramp” where borrowers were shielded from the negative effects of a missed payment. That grace period ended September 30, 2024, and missed payments started hitting credit reports. Student loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1% following the ending of a pandemic-era pause of reporting past-due loans on credit reports, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s first-quarter Household Debt and Credit Report. “Adding student loans back into the mix certainly looks like it was a bridge too far for a lot of people, when it comes to their ability to pay the bills down,” Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, said in a recent interview with CNN. And when the loans land into the serious delinquency territory (when they’re late by 90 days or more), that’s a major knock on people’s ability to achieve other goals: Defaulted borrowers with credit scores above 620 saw average negative score changes north of 140 points, and those with scores north of 720 saw drops of 177 points on average, New York Fed research showed. In addition to the credit score impacts, those who have defaulted on their federal student loans will likely see their wages garnished by the Department of Education. “The money that has to go to student loan payments now is money that can’t go to paying off credit card debt or building an emergency fund or working toward other financial goals that build a stable foundation,” Schulz said. Buy Now, Pay Later installment plans have become more widely available and adoption rates have increased as people of all ages — but especially younger adults — have grown more comfortable incorporating them into their shopping habits. At their best, Buy Now, Pay Later loans can serve as an alternative to credit cards and are used by consumers who are seeking more flexible payment options, who want to overcome a tight financial spot, or who are looking to smooth out some bigger transactions to better meet their budgets. But it’s the where there’s greater cause for concern. Buy Now, Pay Later comes with such ease that people can quickly spend well beyond their means — especially if they start stacking multiple installment loans at the same time. A Bankrate survey conducted in May found that nearly half of all BNPL users experienced at least one problem, and overspending topped the list. In recent months, however, it’s what people have been buying with BNPL loans that have raised red flags among economists and analysts. One in four BNPL users say the installment loans to buy groceries, according to surveys conducted in April and May by LendingTree. That’s up from 14% from a year before. There was a when inflation hit 40-year highs back in 2022. “Those loans have traditionally been thought of for clothing and and things like that,” Schulz said. “But when people are using them for something as basic and fundamental as groceries, it is certainly concerning.” “That hints that people are looking for whatever way they can to extend their budgets in the face of higher interest rates, higher prices at the grocery store and elsewhere, student loan repayments and just other economic headwinds people are facing,” he added. The are weighing more heavily on Americans. Consumer sentiment , and in May , according to the University of Michigan’s closely watched indicator of how people are feeling about the economy. Since 1952, when the university started tracking how Americans felt about the economy, there have been nearly a dozen recessions, several oil price shocks, a few wars, a couple of inflationary episodes, a major financial crisis and a global pandemic. Turns out, a massive trade war nearly trumps all. Trump’s sweeping and steep tariffs and other policy shifts have stoked recession fears and sent sentiment readings south every month this year. The university’s index of consumer sentiment is down almost 30% since January. The biggest concern for the economy is how people and businesses manage those sour feelings and to what extent they change behaviors. A pullback in spending and business investment could ultimately lead to a contraction in the economy and rising unemployment. “If [consumers are] watching the headlines to shape their sentiment, they’re most likely feeling like deer in headlights — unable to move for fear the car may swerve at the last minute,” Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet’s senior economist, wrote in commentary on Friday. “Economic policy is in a state of near-constant flux, and with that, so too are consumer feelings about the economy.” The latest Commerce Department data, however, indicated that Americans’ income growth was and that people bolstered their savings accounts. That could ultimately help people guard against negative effects of the tariffs yet to come, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “Solid income growth and a more elevated saving rate should help cushion households from the brunt of inflation’s tariff-related increases in coming months, resulting in a second-half ‘soft patch’ for the economy rather than a bona fide recession,” he wrote last week.", "tags": ["consumers", "squeeze", "american", "charts"]},
{"content": "Stablecoins are on the verge of going mainstream, analysts say, as a landmark regulatory bill makes its way through Congress. The Senate is deliberating , which would provide a framework for regulating stablecoins. The bill last week passed a major procedural hurdle in the Senate after initial resistance from some Democrats. Stablecoins are a type of crypto asset that is tied to the value of another asset, such as the US dollar or gold. They were initially created as a way for crypto investors to store their money but have grown in popularity in recent years for their use in digital payments. The landmark bill would provide a boost of legitimacy to the crypto industry and is another example of how cryptocurrencies have had a major revival under President Donald Trump’s second term. Proponents of crypto have welcomed the focus on advancing stablecoin regulations. Yet critics have pointed to the Trump family’s ties to the crypto industry: For example, World Liberty Financial, a company tied to the Trump family, has issued its . “Stablecoins seem (to be) here to stay,” analysts at JPMorgan Chase said in an April note. “A few years ago, we probably would have debated the accuracy of that sentence. Not today.” While cryptocurrencies are known for being volatile and fluctuating in value, stablecoins are supposed to be, as their name suggests, stable. This is because stablecoins are pegged one-to-one to another asset. They are most often linked to the US dollar, making one stablecoin worth $1. Companies that issue stablecoins are meant to hold reserves of other assets to back their coins and assure buyers about their value. For example, a company issuing stablecoins pegged to the US dollar could hold cash or cash-equivalent assets like short-term US government bonds. Two of the major stablecoin issuers are El Salvador-based Tether, which issues USDT, and US-based Circle, which issues USDC — and both of these stablecoins are pegged one-to-one to the dollar. Tether’s stablecoin has a market value of just under $154 billion and accounts for 62% of the total stablecoin market, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Circle’s stablecoin has a market value of about $61 billion and accounts for roughly 25% of the total stablecoin market, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The total market value of stablecoins surged from $20 billion in 2020 to $246 billion in May 2025, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank. Stablecoins emerged in 2014 as a way for crypto investors to park their money while buying and selling other more volatile cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Since then, stablecoins have ballooned in popularity particularly for their potential use in digital payments, said Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford University. Visa ( ) in May announced a with Bridge, a stablecoin company owned by fintech startup Stripe, to enable payments using stablecoins in countries across Latin America. Stablecoins, given their stable value, can serve as a medium of exchange and function as a digital currency. The crypto coins have emerged as useful in helping speed up payments across borders. “Cross-border payments are providing the most exciting new use cases,” Duffie said. “Making a payment, such as a remittance or a vendor payment to or from an emerging-market country, can now be made faster and at lower cost than a conventional correspondent banking payment.” While stablecoins are significantly less volatile than other crypto coins, they are not without risks. If the assets backing the coin drop in value and the one-to-one peg falls apart, it could cause the equivalent of a bank run, said Duffie. Stablecoins gained notoriety in 2022 when TerraUSD, an obscure type of coin called an , crashed in value and caused a panic among investors. There are also security risks like people forgetting the pass-code to their crypto wallet. The GENIUS act stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025.” The crypto industry during the election cycle into Trump’s reelection campaign and congressional races. “This is the return on investment for the campaign spending by the crypto industry,” Hillary Allen, a law professor at American University, . If the legislation passes, it could usher in mainstream adoption of stablecoins for digital payments and spur growth in the stablecoin industry, said Christian Catalini, founder of the cryptoeconomics lab at MIT. He added that traditional Wall Street firms and startups would also compete to offer stablecoins. For the major stablecoin issuers, Circle would likely benefit from increased regulation more than Tether as Circle is a US-based company while Tether is based in El Salvador, Del Wright, a law professor at Louisiana State University who specializes in crypto, told CNN. Others have pointed out that the GENIUS Act doesn’t adequately address the risks associated with stablecoins. “As with banks, the US government should tightly regulate stablecoin companies to protect consumers and the economy from financial crashes,” Amanda Fischer, policy director at Better Markets, a nonprofit advocacy group, said in a statement. “The GENIUS Act instead exposes taxpayers to crypto-fueled bailouts by providing a dangerously weak regulatory framework.” “Stablecoins are on the cusp of mainstream adoption in 2025 as the US pushes forward with landmark legislation,” analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a May note. Despite some resistance in the Senate, the analysts “still expect progress this year.”", "tags": ["congress", "stablecoins", "everything"]},
{"content": "Wall Street traders hunting for profits might find that the most lucrative investments are in the peculiar market for precious metals. Gold, silver and platinum prices have surged this year as investors have piled into precious metals in search of places to hide from trade war uncertainty. President Donald Trump’s chaotic tariff plan has rocked markets, and investors have tried to minimize risk by putting some money in safe haven assets. While gold is historically considered a haven, demand for havens has spilled over into its wonky cousins like silver and platinum. The metals craze is reflected in the numbers: Precious metals are trouncing the US stock market this year. Gold has soared 27.5%, silver is up 24% and platinum has surged a whopping 36%. Meanwhile, after rising by 23% last year and 24% in 2023, the S&P 500 is up less than 3% so far this year; there is an unusual amount of jitters in ; and the US dollar has after rising 7% last year. As bonds have been volatile and the dollar has weakened amid tariff turmoil, weird investments like silver and platinum have emerged as a way to hedge against the tremendous uncertainty. “These dynamics have further incentivized investors to diversify away from traditional financial instruments and toward tangible assets,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a Friday note. “Gold continues to be the primary haven,” Hansen added, “but with bullion demand showing signs of stalling as investors look for a fresh trigger to propel prices higher, we have instead in recent weeks seen heightened interest in silver (and) platinum.” Silver and platinum prices have surged higher in recent weeks as investors have sought ways to diversify their portfolios. Supply constraints have also pushed prices higher, Hansen said, and the metals increasingly look like a “rational hedge against political and financial instability.” “These commodities are viewed as politically neutral; unlike sovereign bonds or foreign currencies, they carry no counterparty risk and are not tied to any nation’s credit rating,” Hansen said. “While we remain cautious about predicting an imminent surge to new all-time highs, the macroeconomic backdrop is increasingly supportive of precious metals.” Precious metal prices have also pushed higher as investors have picked up on budding rallies, building a momentum-driven trend, according to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. Bank of America’s survey of global fund managers in May showed that gold was the most crowded trade for the second month in a row. That snapped the Magnificent Seven tech stocks’ 24-month streak as the most crowded trade. During the first quarter of the year, gold posted its strongest quarterly return since 1986. The yellow metal is up 27.5% this year, following its 27% surge from last year. Gold surged higher this year as investors fretted over the uncertain outlook for tariffs. Spot gold prices in April briefly rose above a of $3,500 a troy ounce. Gold traded around $3,350 a troy ounce as of Wednesday. Gold is considered a resilient investment and a hedge against inflation, with investors betting it will retain its value when prices rise. While Wall Street has gold fever, the price of gold has also been boosted by central banks around the world, including in India and China, buying bullion to add to their reserves. Gold demand from central banks was a key driver of its price surge in 2024, according to the World Gold Council, a trade group. Another factor driving gold prices higher has been a weaker US dollar, Sosnick said. When the dollar weakens, commodities like gold tend to perform well as it becomes cheaper for foreign investors to buy bullion. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six major foreign currencies, is down almost 9% this year. “Gold continues to consolidate above $3,300, underpinned by persistent geopolitical risks, uncertainty on trade and a soft dollar,” said Peter A. Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals, in a Tuesday note. As gold has soared higher, silver has started to catch up. Spot silver prices have surged 24% this year after soaring 21% in 2024. Silver this week crossed $36 a troy ounce and hit its highest level since 2012. Michael DiRienzo, president and CEO at the industry group Silver Institute, told CNN that silver prices have surged higher due to industrial demand and heightened economic uncertainty. “There’s just a lot of concern about the global economy, and when that happens, people turn to hard assets like silver,” DiRienzo said. “Silver tends to follow gold upwards,” he added. Silver is widely used for industrial purposes, including data centers, solar panels and smartphones, and uncertainty about tariffs has caused demand for silver to surge, DiRienzo said. “It’s really reverting back to its dual use as an industrial metal and as a precious metal,” he said. “And both sides of the ledger are kind of coming together to push this price forward.” Sustained demand for silver, driven by investors and industry, could push the metal to record highs, according to commodities research firm CPM Group. “Silver offers an attractive entry point for investors seeking alternatives to high-priced gold, bolstered by its extensive industrial applications,” analysts at CPM Group said in a May note. People can invest in silver or gold in the form of bars and coins, or in the form of exchange-traded funds. The iShares Silver Trust ETF has surged 25% this year alongside the price of silver. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF has surged 27% this year. Sosnick at Interactive Brokers said he also thinks silver’s rise has been momentum-driven as traders have tried to join in on the rally. Platinum has also surged alongside silver as a less costly investment than gold. Platinum has gained a whopping 36% this year after falling almost 10% across 2024. Spot platinum prices this week rose above $1,200 a troy ounce and hit their highest level since 2021. “While gold has dominated the performance of the metals complex over the last year, we are starting to see the laggards like platinum … emerge from bases to catch-up a bit,” said Jonathan Krinsky, chief markets technician at global financial services firm BTIG, in a recent note. The precious metal, which is used in including automotive and jewelry, has rallied largely due to demand exceeding supply. Platinum has surged higher in recent weeks after the World Platinum Investment Council, a trade group, projected a deficit for the third year in a row. “This anticipated shortfall, which will draw down existing above-ground inventories, is being driven by demand from the automotive sector and, notably, a surge in Chinese interest in jewelry, bars and coins,” Saxo Bank’s Hansen said. “Jewelers are the second-biggest platinum buyer after the auto industry,” analysts at Bank of America said in a Friday note. “After years of declining demand, there is anecdotal evidence that interest in platinum jewelry is now bouncing back in China.” “Rising gold prices are incentivizing jewelers to diversify, in what represents a change to historical patterns,” the analysts noted.", "tags": ["trades", "street", "weird"]},
{"content": "A London-based technology company is looking to “democratize” talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. “We’re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts’] time,” said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. “To say [to scouts], ‘Go over to this place today because there’s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard’ — that’s going to be the best use of your time.’” It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021. Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app — which fully launched in September 2023 — according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the “lion’s share” of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for “tier one” sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. “It’s more about evolution than revolution,” Felton-Thomas explained. “We can’t tell you when that player’s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he’s 2-0 down? What happens when someone’s shouting at him? What happens when he’s just made a massive mistake?” “We’ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you’re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.” While football remains ai.io’s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. “You think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,” Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "tags": ["app", "stars", "clubs", "scout", "soccer", "future", "top"]},
{"content": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that “surging demand” for EVs over the next decade was set “to remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.” It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency’s bullish long-term outlook for EVs — based on current government policies — comes just days after the world’s biggest battery EV maker Tesla to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data “does not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,” he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. In a statement, Birol said: “Rather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.” Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world’s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its in nearly four years. The company’s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China’s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the “pace of the transition to EVs… will hinge on affordability.” In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. “Intensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,” the IEA said. “Growing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,” it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. “China is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,” Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an late last year into China’s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region’s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. “This shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,” Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.", "tags": ["iea", "electric", "car", "track", "revolution"]},

However, it’s clear that there is something different about Dex; she’s an entirely virtual “digital human,” designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine — a 3D modeling software widely used in video games — combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. “She’s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,” says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. “You can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.” Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she’s a “showpiece” for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can “listen” to people’s questions and converse in real time. “Shellie” can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while “Arif” is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. “What we’ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,” Sims tells CNN. “It becomes natural.” Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI — artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational “digital humans” that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted that answers questions on Qatar Airways’ website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market. “When we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?” asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. “In some ways, we think of AI as something that’s helping us or augmenting our work,” she says. “However, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.” Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. “Every scenario that we found, we’re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,” she says. “Digital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,” adds Sims. “We’ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.”", "tags": ["intelligence", "artificial", "face", "humans", "relatable", "digital"]},
{"content": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That’s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year — the exact date has yet to be confirmed — carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon’s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. “The first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,” Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia’s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon Images of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network — would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA’s program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. “Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund. “Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.” It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth’s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a in 2020, and in January, Nokia was by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.” “A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. “This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.” There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. “Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said.", "tags": ["nokia", "space", "nasa", "moon"]},

Sora 2, currently the no. 1 free app in Apple’s US App Store, is part of a fast-growing (and so destabilizing it’s frightening) phenomenon. It comes fast on the heels of Meta releasing a new AI video feed called Vibes. And it adds to a season full of heightened stress about “AI slop.” Unreal videos are moving from a concerning sideshow to being the centerpiece of our feeds. For former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, the biggest takeaway about Sora and Vibes is that consumers are valuing AI-generated videos “like they do traditionally created good short form vids.” For users, it’s not necessarily a question of “real” versus “fake,” but rather “fun to watch” versus “boring.” And with Sora’s “cameos,” which turn people into playable characters, your actual face is inside the artificial reality, so what’s “fake” anymore? Stating the obvious: The implications for human-made news and info are massive. As Scott Rosenberg wrote for , “Feeds, memes and slop are the building blocks of a new media world where verification vanishes, unreality dominates, everything blurs into everything else and nothing carries any informational or emotional weight.” For a brief moment in history, video was evidence of reality. Now it’s a tool for unreality. Two teams at The New York Times tried out Sora, which is currently invite-only, and the resulting stories reflected the power and the possibility of the technology. Reporters Mike Isaac and Eli Tan the amazing, “jaw-dropping” creativity that Sora has unleashed before turning to the “disconcerting” aspects of the app. Tiffany Hsu, Stuart A. Thompson and Steven Lee Myers the app’s ability to make disinformation “extremely easy and extremely real.” NPR’s Geoff Brumfiel that OpenAI’s “guardrails” against unwelcome content “appeared to be somewhat loose around Sora. While many prompts were refused, it was possible to generate videos that support conspiracy theories. For example it was easy to create a video of what appeared to be President Richard Nixon giving a televised address telling America the moon landing was faked.” That’s kind of the whole point — to be able to create almost anything. “Prioritize creation” is the way Altman put it. And the result, as Hayden Field for The Verge, is that “it’s getting hard to tell what’s real.” Or rather, it’s getting harder. It’s natural to wonder what concepts like “high-quality,” “edited” and “fact-checked” will mean in a world of infinite and mostly AI-generated content. The war for attention is ferocious and yet it’s barely even started, considering what seems to be coming. “Ever since the early days of social media and YouTube, there has been more content created than people could ever watch, so we allowed algorithms to sort through it all and tell us what we watch, and we saw what happened to the media landscape, to our attention economy,” Human Ventures co-founder Joe Marchese told Reliable Sources. “Now we are entering an entirely new epoch where Generative AI will allow for the creation of infinite content, at ever lower costs, meaning the means of distribution, the platforms and their algorithms, are going to have to adjust again, and the business models we built, however shaky on top of the platforms and their algorithms, are about to be upended, again,” he continued. “The future of the attention economy, that all us humans have to live in together, feels more chaotic than ever.” With that in mind, here are a few of this week’s best reads about Sora and the implications for all of us. Platformer’s Casey Newton recapped “ .” In sum: “It’s cool. It’s scary. It’s a hit.” Over at Business Insider, Katie Notopoulos all the “worries and fears” about Sora and wrote about how deliriously fun it is. It’s addictive “because it’s starring .” “It turns out that people may not mind AI slop as long as they can be part of it with their friends,” Alex Heath wrote in . “That Meta, the most successful social media company in history, apparently did not understand this, while OpenAI did, is striking.” “Should public figures be fair game in this game? The lawyers are going to have a field day in this brave new world,” Spyglass reporter M.G. Siegler after making a video of John F. Kennedy saying that his favorite movie is the Care Bears. “The difference with Sora 2, I think, is that OpenAI, like X’s Grok, has completely given up any pretense that this is anything other than a machine that is trained on other people’s work that it did not pay for, and that can easily recreate that work,” 404 Media’s Jason Koebler. And another big question: Will studios sue? “Talks are underway,” Winston Cho for The Hollywood Reporter. Pondering the longer-term consequences of these tools can be overwhelming. Historically, people have primarily been consumers of media, not creators. What does it mean when we’re all creators first and foremost? It’s good to be instinctively wary of AI hype artists, but some of these predictions from tech investor Greg Isenberg feel spot-on. “In 5-10 years,” , “people won’t ask ‘what’s your favorite show?’ they’ll ask ‘what’s your favorite generator?’” We also have to ask, as the aforementioned Casey Newton , “what happens when the majority of video we consume is not just synthetic but also highly personalized: tuned not just to our individual tastes and interests but also to our faces and voices.” If you think today’s information bubbles divide us, wait until each of us lives in a bubble designed for one.", "tags": ["need", "unreality", "ai", "pay", "attention", "future", "sora"]},
{"content": "American car buyers braced for the worst when President Donald Trump’s auto tariffs started taking effect in April. But so far, prices are little changed. However, industry experts don’t expect that will remain true for long if tariffs stay in place— so Americans may want to buy a car now before prices start to rise within a few months. “So far there’s a mismatch between the expectation of what would happen, and the reality of what has happened with prices,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying research site Edmunds.com. “But I still think we’re still going to prices start to take off in two to three months.” Even with 25% tariffs on all imported cars and auto parts, prices are mostly being kept in check. The price paid for new cars in May fell 0.2% on average compared to the month before, according to data from Edmunds, and they rose only 2.5% compared to the pre-tariff period in March. That was also reflected in the government’s consumer price index for May, which reported both new and used car prices dipped when adjusted for seasonal factors. There are numerous factors keeping prices steady. Tariff fears kept buyers away in April and May, and reduced demand limited the dealers’ ability to raise prices. Experts CNN spoke to say the auto industry is also concerned about announcing big price hikes that could anger the Trump administration. But mostly, dealers are still working through their supply of pre-tariff cars. Most of the cars that have been sold since the imposition of tariffs in April were either imported into the United States or built before the tariffs went into effect, Drury said. “The impact is not there yet,” he said. In March, automakers had between a 30- and 77-day supply of cars on the lots, depending upon the manufacturer, according to Edmunds. Additionally, the customer demand simply is not there. Some buyers rushed to buy cars in March before the tariffs were put in place, creating a surge in sales in the first quarter and weakening demand since then. Plus, concerns about the economy and job security, along with high interest rates, could be keeping some from making a big purchase. While Edmunds has yet to give a second-quarter sales forecast, Drury said “the odds are good” that trend will continue and sales will be down or, at best, flat compared to the same time last year. But Drury said the lack of price increases could start to draw consumers back into the car buying market later this year. The Conference Board reported in May that 12.1% of Americans consumers were considering purchasing a new car in the next six months. That’s a significant jump from the 10.6% who said the same in April, and more in line with normal seasonal interest in car purchases. When customers do jump back into the market for a car, they may see prices creep up. Every automaker is affected by the tariffs. Except for Tesla, every major company imports cars they sell at US dealerships from foreign plants, accounting for 46% of US auto sales in 2024, according to S&P Global Mobility. Even those built at American factories use imported parts. Drury said some manufacturers are already raising costs in ways that don’t show up in the price, like adding fees and reducing incentives offered to buyers. But as tariffed vehicles begin to hit the lots, experts expect them to eventually pass some of that cost on. Car prices are not set by the automakers – they’re negotiated between dealers and buyers. But automakers do set a “manufacturers’ suggested retail price” or MSRP, also known as the sticker price. Adam Jonas, auto analyst at Bank of America, thinks that automakers will likely raise the MSRP later this year when the 2026 model year cars start being delivered to dealers. “We’re hearing price hike announcement slowly,” Jonas said at a recent Bank of America conference. “I think with the changeover to 2026 models, (that) will be the opportunity for companies to raise prices on new vehicles so they don’t enrage certain folks that might come down on them for raising prices.” Until then, automakers are willing to pay some of the cost of tariffs out of reduced profits, partly due to weaker demand from buyers, partly to avoid angering the Trump administration. Drury said even when do automakers raise prices, they will be careful not to attribute the increases to tariffs. “I think they’ve learned there’s nothing good that comes from doing that,” he said.", "tags": ["prices", "car", "tariffs", "months", "time"]},
{"content": "There are plenty of billionaires and pop stars, but there is only one Taylor Swift. Swift is not just selling albums; her team has created an entire economic ecosystem that extends from cassette sales to hotel room bookings. Swift herself wears many hats. She’s a global entertainer, movie producer and, thanks to her to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, a fixture of the NFL. As of 2023, she’s also a . Swift released her 12th studio album Friday, “ ,” along with a , both of which are expected to pull in even further millions – if not more. Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index estimated her wealth grew another billion dollars over the past two years, now putting her worth at $2.1 billion due to changes in the markets, cash from the record-breaking Eras Tour and its own concert movie, as well as her to all of her early albums. And unlike most celebrities, Swift has made lucrative business dealings a part of her persona, positioning herself at the vanguard of the long narrative in the music business that unseen executives received much of the money actually generated by artists. “Taylor came out and said, ‘I’m not going to let that happen, I’m going to change the industry,’” University of Oregon music professor Drew Nobile told CNN. “That’s why the whole idea of Swiftonomics took hold.” Swift’s last concert movie, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” was an unprecedented boon for the sluggish post-Covid box office, grossing $261.7 million worldwide, IMDB data shows. AMC, the movie’s distributor, that the film “shattered records for single-day advance ticket sales revenue,” crushing the previous record held by “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” less than three hours after tickets became available. Swift also made the decision to work with movie theater chain AMC directly, cutting out traditional movie studios, allowing her to take a greater cut of the gross profits. Now, Swift is embarking on another AMC-distributed film with “ ,” a concert movie framed as a release party for her latest album playing over one weekend. reports it’s expected to rake in anywhere between $30 million to $35 million domestically. Swift redefined “how the movie theater can be used to promote her music, her career, and her public persona,” Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore, told CNN. Taylor Swift’s massive Eras Tour famously spilled over into the 51 cities she toured in. It became the of all time with an estimated windfall of $2.2 billion in North American ticket sales alone. in the United States in relation to the Eras tour, according to survey company Question Pro. The US Travel Association found that Eras Tour attendees spent an average of $1,300 on travel, hotels, food and merchandise – about as much as Super Bowl goers. Downtown areas in the cities she attended reported spikes in traffic and hotel occupancies, breaking records in cities like Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While the album release certainly won’t like the Eras Tour did, American University economics professor Kara Reynolds noted that Swift’s albums tend to spend money more locally than other artists. That translates into business at bars hosting release parties, customers buying new outfits for those parties and ticket sales at the movie theater. Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index the value of the music Swift has made since 2019 to be $400 million. With from a private equity firm, that number will certainly increase now that she has control over her entire music catalog, as well as the “Taylor’s Version” re-records. Now, Swift can ride on the historical success of her early work and also on any new projects since the Eras Tour launched her into even more stardom. Reynolds said that when Swift releases an album, streaming of her previous work also spikes, and that will surely bring in even more money. Swift has been Spotify’s top global artist for the two years, and her albums have gone platinum – meaning they’ve sold more than a million copies – more than 100 times. And that doesn’t include her singles and non-album releases. The rise of streaming services means we’re long past the days of album sales being the primary business model for artists. Swift has been a pioneer of the new method: viewing a new album as a gateway to fuel “cottage industries” like merchandise, collectible vinyl and cassette editions, tours and films. “It’s not just album sales anymore, or just tickets,” Nobile said. “It’s a whole economic apparatus.”", "tags": ["swift", "album", "empire", "business", "taylor", "sales"]},
{"content": "Journalist and entrepreneur Bari Weiss is taking charge at CBS News and her startup, The Free Press, is being acquired by CBS parent company Paramount. Starting today, Weiss is the editor-in-chief of CBS News, a new position that has stirred anxieties within the storied news division. Weiss said in a memo to staffers that she wants to help make CBS “the most trusted news organization in America and the world.” She will continue to run The Free Press as a standalone brand within its new owner, Paramount. The company did not release details about the transaction, but the Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount is paying about $150 million for the startup. It’s a buzzy and risky move — the editor of a digital magazine with a clear editorial POV collaborating with one of the country’s oldest broadcasters — that reflects Paramount CEO David Ellison’s desire to shake up CBS News. Ellison recently took control of Paramount through a merger with his own smaller company, Skydance Media, and he has been talking with Weiss about joining forces for months. Sources previously told CNN that Ellison was interested in infusing her editorial perspective into CBS News. The Free Press has won fans, and created plenty of fodder for critics, with heterodox columns and features. Since the site launched as a newsletter in 2021, its volume of so-called anti-woke content has stood out in a crowded media landscape; so have its opinion pieces conveying strong support for Israel, a view that Ellison outspokenly shares. In a letter to all Paramount staffers on Monday morning, Ellison bemoaned “partisan division and hostile disputes” in America and said the media “amplifies the very partisanship tearing our society apart.” At Paramount, he said, “We aim to do our part in helping rebuild a society where our shared humanity unites us, and where our differences become a source of strength rather than division.” In a sign that he is prioritizing this project, he said Weiss would report directly to him, outside the existing organizational chart for CBS News. Tom Cibrowski will remain president of CBS News and will continue to report to Paramount TV boss George Cheeks. Paramount said, “Cibrowski’s decades of journalistic, operational, and broadcast experience provide essential continuity and expertise.” Weiss lacks experience managing a newsroom the size of CBS or overseeing a stable of TV shows like “60 Minutes.” But she brings a news sensibility and attitude that Ellison wants to elevate. Paramount described the editor-in-chief role this way: “Weiss will shape editorial priorities, champion core values across platforms, and lead innovation in how the organization reports and delivers the news.” In a letter to The Free Press subscribers, Weiss said the site will continue to publish stories, podcasts, and other content. The acquisition “gives The Free Press a chance to help reshape a storied media organization — to help guide CBS News into a future that honors those great values that underpin The Free Press and the best of American journalism,” she said. Weiss asserted in the letter that “the illiberalism of our institutions,” a primary topic of The Free Press in its first years, was “the story of the last decade,” but said “we now face a different form of illiberalism emanating from our fringes.” “On the one hand,” she said, “an America-loathing far left. On the other, a history-erasing far right. These extremes do not represent the majority of the country, but they have increasing power in our politics, our culture, and our media ecosystem.” There is an opportunity, she argued, to serve “the enormous numbers of smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans” who are the “actual mainstream” in America. Ellison has made similar comments about wanting CBS News to appeal to “70%” of Americans ranging “from center left to center right,” pointedly excluding hyperpartisan extremes. In a Monday statement, he said, “We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home.” Weiss is expected to meet with CBS News staffers later on Monday. In her letter to subscribers, she said of Ellison and the Paramount leadership team, “They understand, as we do, that America cannot thrive without common facts, common truths, and a common reality.”", "tags": ["paramount", "cbs", "weiss", "news", "editor", "free", "press", "bari", "chief"]},
{"content": "OpenAI was an artificial intelligence research lab little known outside of Silicon Valley before ChatGPT debuted in November 2022. Three years later, OpenAI has become synonymous with the AI boom, making it the envy of its tech peers and thrusting CEO Sam Altman into President Donald Trump’s orbit. ChatGPT writes apps, plans trips and browses the web on users’ behalf. And OpenAI is making inroads into shopping, entertainment, education and government services — laying out plans to become more like a platform than a basic app in its developer conference on Monday. As its software spills into more areas of online life, OpenAI is shelling out billions to become a leading player in the physical infrastructure for the AI future. With its latest major investment, announced on Monday, OpenAI will invest in 6 gigawatts of data center capacity . That deal follows similar agreements with Nvidia and Oracle. In some ways, OpenAI’s expansion is circular — it needs new applications to bring in the money to fund its massive computing power. And it needs even more computing resources to power those new tools. OpenAI’s rapid expansion comes against a challenging backdrop. Tech companies are competing fiercely to build the most powerful AI models, but some investors worry the market is in a bubble. What’s more, OpenAI is competing with tech giants such as Meta that already have vast tech ecosystems to help them expand and earn money from their AI tech. And OpenAI, which is not yet profitable, needs to find a way to continue raking in huge amounts of cash to fund its future endeavors. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Google, Amazon and Meta laid the groundwork for the modern web by popularizing search engines, e-commerce and social media. OpenAI could do the same for the AI era by adding new capabilities to ChatGPT, which 800 million weekly active users, according to Altman. OpenAI wants users to get things done online without ever having to leave ChatGPT, which could one day put the app at the core of how people use technology, much like Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android system. Soon ChatGPT will be able to create user playlists directly on Spotify or browse apartment listings on Zillow right from chats, OpenAI announced on Monday. In late September, OpenAI launched a tool called Instant Checkout that lets users buy certain items directly through ChatGPT. ChatGPT also now has a study mode, which tailors prompts and responses for students using the tool for schoolwork. And its new Sora 2 app is challenging Meta and TikTok with a scrollable feed of AI-generated short-form videos. OpenAI could even challenge the most prominent device in consumers’ daily lives: the smartphone. The company is with former Apple design chief Jony Ive on a new AI hardware product, though details are slim. (OpenAI’s peers like Google and Meta are chasing hardware markets by releasing smart glasses with built-in AI assistants.) OpenAI’s trajectory mirrors the rise of Google parent Alphabet, which built its business around indexing the web and now has a foothold in everything from consumer tech devices to health research. Thomas Thiele, an AI expert at management consulting group Arthur D. Little, said he sees similarities between the two companies. Google “has become this very broad corporation that has an inevitable footprint in everything we see on the internet,” Thiele said. “OpenAI is also aiming for a much bigger footprint.” But scaling up those AI efforts means investing heavily in the sprawling data centers and infrastructure necessary to power them.  OpenAI is shelling out billions of dollars to build a massive physical footprint, with plans for AI data centers across the United States and around the world. “We need as much computing power as we can possibly get,” OpenAI President Greg Brockman on Monday. In January, with Oracle and SoftBank to invest up to $500 billion in a company called Stargate to build more AI infrastructure in the United States. The group’s first project, a one-million-square-foot data center, is already under construction in Abilene, Texas, with additional sites planned in Texas, New Mexico and the Midwest. OpenAI agreed in July to pay Oracle over five years to develop additional data center capacity for Stargate. Last month, OpenAI said it would buy enough Nvidia AI chips to power 10 gigawatts of data center capacity in exchange for a $100 billion investment from the chipmaker. And while analysts expect Nvidia — the undisputed leader in AI chips — to remain OpenAI’s core infrastructure partner, the ChatGPT maker is now also hedging its bets with its AMD deal. OpenAI has also signed onto partnerships to build out AI infrastructure abroad, including in the and . OpenAI’s aggressive expansion could be critical to keep up with rivals like Meta, Microsoft and Google that have spent decades building their digital ecosystems, said Daniel Keum, an associate professor at Columbia Business School. Google, for example, has the advantage of plugging its AI into popular services like Gmail and Google Docs. “ChatGPT is great right now, but it’s not ChatGPT versus Copilot. It’s ChatGPT versus the Microsoft bundle,” said Keum. So for OpenAI, working with chipmakers to maintain the most advanced large language models could give it a leg up, he said. But to carry out its ambitious infrastructure plans, OpenAI needs to continue bringing in a whole lot of cash. The company is valued at $500 billion. But it’s still far from profitable; it posted an operating loss of $7.8 billion in the first half of 2025 and is still ramping up data center spending, according to a from tech news site The Information. It’s unclear whether OpenAI’s bid to turn ChatGPT into an all-encompassing platform will put it on the path to profitability. William Lee, a corporate investor at SuRo Capital, sees it as a “chicken-or-the-egg” problem, he said in an interview with CNN. Demand may be hard to gauge ahead of time, but the more OpenAI customizes ChatGPT for tasks like shopping and schoolwork, the more people could use it for those activities. It’s a strategy that has worked for the tech giants of today — spend aggressively to make your technology essential to millions of users’ lives, figure out how to make money from them later. OpenAI is clearly betting that it will pay off again. “AI revenue is growing faster than, I think, almost any product in history,” Brockman told Bloomberg. “At the end of the day, the reason this compute power is so important, is so worthwhile for everyone to build, is because the revenue ultimately will be there.”", "tags": ["billions", "era", "build", "web", "openai"]},
{"content": "In a significant challenge to Nvidia’s dominance, OpenAI Monday it would buy 6 gigawatts of computing power from data centers that will run exclusively on AMD chips. Nvidia ( ) has become the go-to AI chipmaker in recent years, propelling it to a $4.6 trillion market capitalization that has made it the world’s most valuable public company. OpenAI, famous for its ChatGPT AI chatbot, is the artificial-intelligence frontrunner that just made waves when it launched the . Just two weeks ago, the companies announced a , in which Nvidia agreed to start delivering chips in 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in that the company plans to increase its Nvidia purchasing and that the AMD partnership is “incremental” to its “work with Nvidia.” But AMD is no slouch, and demand for AI computing power is so high that OpenAI needed to hedge its bets. The deal will provide OpenAI with 1 gigawatt of power by this time next year and it will add another 5 gigawatts on future generations of AMD’s high-end Instinct processors. OpenAI will work with AMD ( ) to build the technology, and it will invest significantly in AMD to fuel its chip-building capabilities. Shares of AMD jumped 36% in premarket trading on the news. Shares of Nvidia fell 2%. “With a 10% stake in AMD this quickly brings Lisa Su and AMD right into the core of the AI chip spending cycle and is a huge vote of confidence from OpenAI and Altman,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in an industry note Monday morning. The companies said the partnership would deliver tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AMD, but they didn’t disclose the exact amount of the deal. AMD issued OpenAI a warrant of 160 million shares of its stock, worth more than $26.3 billion at Friday’s closing price. Those shares would vest over time as the partnership achieves specific milestones, including share-price targets and overcoming technological hurdles for what Lisa Su, AMD’s CEO, called “the world’s most ambitious AI buildout.” “This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential,” Altman said in a statement. “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.” Su called the partnership a “win-win.” The amount of money getting thrown around the AI industry is staggering. In addition to the AMD and Nvidia deals, OpenAI agreed last month to pay Oracle for 4.5 gigawatts of data center space. And OpenAI is believed to have inked a $10 billion chip design deal to train its AI models, a move that could potentially reduce its reliance on partners like Nvidia and AMD. That’s why the AMD announcement may have been significant, but not exactly surprising — OpenAI has been diversifying its supply of chips for a while, notes Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “AMD is another big player in this space, so this deal is a logical move from OpenAI and is great news for AMD,” said Barringer. It’s no surprise that the eight most valuable companies on the market are all heavily invested in AI — and all are worth more than $1.4 trillion. Following Nvidia are Microsoft ( ), Apple ( ), Google ( ), Amazon ( ) and Meta ( ), each of which announced new consumer-focused AI products in recent months. Broadcom, with a $1.6 trillion valuation, is No. 7 on the list. And Elon Musk’s Tesla, which has bet its future on AI-powered robotaxis and could soon make a large investment in Musk’s xAI company, is No. 8 on the list. Although those companies have driven enormous market gains over the past several years, many Wall Street analysts fear that the AI market has become a bubble — powered by unsustainable gains that are driven more by FOMO than fundamentals.

So they can call home and communicate with their friends,” she said. “But the reality is that we have let a monster loose. Never before have so many children and young people suffered from anxiety and depression,” Frederiksen added. The Danish prime minister said many children find it difficult to read and concentrate, while some “see things they shouldn’t see” online. Frederiksen also cited statistics showing that 60% of boys aged 11 to 19 don’t physically see a single friend in their free time over the course of a week. (Frederiksen did not specify a source for the numbers.) “Do you think that number would be so high if it weren’t for the smartphone?” she asked. “Mobile phones and social media are stealing our children’s childhood,” said Frederiksen, adding that the new law would mean “that we take better care of our children here in Denmark.” The proposal comes after lawmakers voted to ban cell phones from primary schools and after-school programs at the end of September, a move recommended by a wellbeing commission set up by Frederiksen in 2023. Denmark is one of a number of countries that are taking action to limit children’s access to cell phones and social media.

{"content": "Military officials are pushing forward with new restrictions on the Pentagon press corps despite objections from news organizations and watchdog groups. The policies “appear designed to stifle a free press” and “further isolate reporters” who are trying to do their jobs, the association representing Pentagon beat reporters said Wednesday. “Limiting the media’s ability to report on the U.S. military fails to honor the American families who have entrusted their sons and daughters to serve in it, or the taxpayers responsible for giving the department hundreds of billions of dollars a year,” the Pentagon Press Association said in its first detailed statement on the matter. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s press office outlined new rules that would sharply restrict reporting, leveraging the fact that many military reporters have press credentials allowing physical access to the Pentagon complex. The initial draft said beat reporters would have to sign a pledge to not obtain or use unauthorized material, even if the information is unclassified, essentially turning reporters into Pentagon PR representatives. As CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, a former Pentagon correspondent himself, pointed out on air, “We’re not supposed to be stenographers for the U.S. military.” But the administration only wants reporters to relay “what’s out there in formal, public Pentagon press releases, and not do any serious reporting on subjects that the Pentagon doesn’t necessarily want the American people to know about.” Newsroom leaders and media lawyers concluded that military reporters could not accept the new policies as written, and pressed for changes, while also contemplating legal action. On Monday, the Pentagon circulated an updated draft and gave reporters one week to review and sign, raising the possibility that many news outlets would soon lose access to the Pentagon complex. “We still have concerns with the updated language of the policy and expect that it will pose a significant impediment as journalists weigh with their employers whether or not to sign this revised version,” Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press VP of policy Gabe Rottman said in a statement. The press association acknowledged that the Pentagon’s revisions are “no longer requiring reporters to express agreement with the new policy as a condition for obtaining press credentials.” “But the Pentagon is still asking us to affirm in writing our ‘understanding’ of policies that appear designed to stifle a free press and potentially expose us to prosecution for simply doing our jobs,” the association said. The association noted that the revised policy also signals that Hegseth’s deputies intend “to move all of our news organizations from our dedicated workspaces.” The press office already booted some news outlets, including CNN, NBC, NPR and The Washington Post, from those workspaces earlier this year. This move “will further isolate reporters, making it harder to interact even with the spokespeople inside the Pentagon who are entrusted to approve information for public release,” the association said. Hegseth, who has been bedeviled by leaks during his tenure as Defense Secretary, has portrayed his actions against the press corps as a matter of national security. “If you want to move around the building, you’re going to have a badge,” he recently said on Fox, misleading viewers about how press access has historically worked. “Pentagon reporters have always worn badges, and continue to do so to this day,” the association noted on Wednesday. Konstantin Toropin, a Navy veteran who covers the Pentagon for The Associated Press, wrote on X that Hegseth has been making “multiple untrue claims about us and our work” while trying to “roll back” press access. Most major news outlets have not expressly said whether they’ll accept the new rules. However, a spokesperson for CNN pointed out on Wednesday that press credentials are not a necessity for covering military news.

{"content": "Top Republicans in Congress will take a massive gamble on in the coming days: GOP leaders will not step in to prevent missed paychecks to the military. It’s the most dramatic step yet by Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson to attempt to force Democrats to end the government shutdown, even as they realize their party will, too, face political pain for the move. And it comes at a high-stakes moment for both parties: This would be the first time in recent history that active-duty military service members will on a large scale during a shutdown. President Donald Trump, however, said Saturday that he’s “identified funds” to get troops paid next week. The funds for military pay will come from the Pentagon’s research and development money that’s available for two years, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget. Behind the scenes, Thune and Johnson have agreed that Republicans can make no attempts to lessen the pain they argue Democrats are causing millions of Americans by rejecting the GOP’s plan to simply extend current funding — concerned that if Congress took that step, Democrats would face less pressure to reopen the government, according to multiple GOP leadership sources. As the shutdown drags into its third week, tensions are rising in the GOP with no clear way out. Lawmakers are angry at one another for getting into now-viral hallway confrontations with Democrats or doing high-profile interviews where they blame their own party for the lapse. Some are angry at GOP leadership for failing to address the military pay issue from the start, or for the optics of keeping the House out of session for weeks on end. But those CNN spoke with expressed an acute anger at Senate Democrats. “I’m going back to DC. I’ve had enough,” said Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley of California, who has raised his concerns with House GOP leadership. “I just can’t fathom why we would not be there.” But Thune and Johnson are publicly resolute in their position, and the party remains in lockstep on big-picture strategy: Republicans will make no guarantee on , and the only way out of a shutdown is for Senate Democrats to retreat, despite any political pain that the GOP will feel over the , according to interviews with two dozen lawmakers and senior aides. It underscores the depth of Congress’ ugly stalemate, with Democrats dug in. “We’re in a bind as Republicans, but they’re in a huge bind as Democrats,” Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said, summing up the party’s mood. Even Van Drew, who believes the party needs to take action on the expiring subsidies, was clear that Democrats must be the ones to yield. Both Thune and Johnson have stressed that Democrats are blocking the military pay. “Well, there’s a military pay bill right here,” Thune said on Friday, holding up a paper copy of the GOP stopgap spending bill. “All they have to do is pick it up at the desk, give us five votes and the military gets paid.” Inside the upper rungs of leadership, Republicans have been astounded by Democrats’ continued rejection of a bill to extend Biden-era funding levels and their hardline position on the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. But publicly and privately, GOP lawmakers in both chambers have expressed they believe the public will ultimately support their argument — despite favoring Democrats — and are prepared to let the shutdown drag on until Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer backs down. “We think we’re winning this argument,” one GOP campaign operative said, summing up the party’s overarching position. Still, it’s not an easy stance for the GOP, a party that sees itself as champions of the military. For many members of leadership, it’s personal, too: Thune hails from a military family, while Johnson’s son attends the Naval Academy. Others in leadership, like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, also have children serving in the military. As that anxiety builds, Johnson and his team have fielded a number of calls from House Republicans this week urging him to bring the chamber back into session so troops do not have to miss their October 15 paycheck, multiple GOP sources told CNN. GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, a former Navy helicopter pilot whose district is home to more than 88,000 active-duty military members, introduced legislation to pay troops in September and the bill has nearly 150 co-sponsors, with the majority of them being Republicans. Kiggans is also one of the GOP’s most politically endangered members in next year’s midterms. In a statement, Kiggans called on Schumer to vote to open the government, and said she has also encouraged GOP leadership to hold a vote on her bill to ensure service members get paid. “I have spoken to Speaker Johnson and our House leadership about this bill since before the shutdown. I have encouraged them to bring this bipartisan bill to the House floor for a vote,” the congresswoman said. “I would support returning to Washington to pass this bill if needed.” Another supporter of that bill, GOP Rep. Ken Calvert, who oversees defense funding in the House, said in a statement to CNN that troops’ pay should not be held up by the government funding fight. (Calvert faces a potential GOP primary next year because of his state’s Democratic redistricting push.) “I will always make the pay and welfare of our troops a top priority as Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee. We can have policy and political fights in Congress, but we simply can’t ask service members to put themselves in harm’s way without paying them” Calvert said. “It should be a red line for anyone who cares about our national security and our troops.” In a preview of this week’s pain, Johnson by a C-SPAN live caller who is a military wife and mother, urging him to pass legislation to allow active-duty military service members to get paid during the government shutdown. And some House Republicans are frustrated in the GOP’s message. “I don’t think it matters to her if you say, ‘Oh well, you know the Senate’s to blame, or Chuck Schumer is to blame. It doesn’t really matter to her or to her children who is to blame, what matters is they’re not going to get paychecks,” Kiley told CNN. “And if we have a way to make sure that they do get their paycheck, then we should absolutely do that even if we don’t solve the larger problem.” “I’d vote for that in a minute,” GOP Rep. Mark Amodei, a former Army lawyer who served in the Judge Advocate General Corps, said on the prospect of voting on military pay. But Johnson and his leadership team have held firm that the House has done its job by passing a clean extension of government funding — which included pay for the military and federal workforce through late November. And notably, members haven’t taken any drastic steps to buck leadership and force votes on a bill. A senior House Republican argued that Democrats merely want a “show vote” in support of troops. There have been some glimpses of daylight between the two GOP leaders on the issue, however. Earlier this week, Johnson and Thune initially offered different answers on the military pay issue. The GOP speaker did not rule out the idea of a standalone bill, while Thune was clear he would not bring it up. That mix-up prompted a brief check-in between the Senate Republican leader and his House counterpart to make sure the two were on the same page, according to three people familiar with the exchange. Johnson has privately said it was just a verbal misstep and that he did indeed support the strategy, one of those sources said. GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a retired Navy SEAL who was serving in the military when the government shut down in 2013, told CNN that Democrats are “playing politics with our service members’ pay” by wanting a separate vote to fund the military. “They’re trying to get out of this. But they are responsible,” he said. In lieu of congressional action, there was some discussion of whether the White House can step in to pay troops without congressional approval. One idea being floated was for the White House to use revenue generated from tariffs, but one senior House GOP aide cautioned that is “a big question mark.” Republicans also insist Democrats are making a major miscalculation in their shutdown demands. Democrats have said they will not agree to reopen the government until they have a concrete deal to prevent billions of dollars in those subsidies from lapsing at year’s end. But Republicans are privately not sure whether there will be a deal at all. Senior members of GOP leadership in both chambers are unsure whether any version of a subsidies measure can pass with enough Republican votes. Any deal would would likely require extended negotiations, with clear buy-in from Trump — and Congress is running out of time. Some center-right Republicans have been vocal about the need to do something about the deadline: They acknowledge that many of those receiving subsidies are their own voters and that the party can’t afford politically to simply let that lapse. “To get rid of the credits, it’s morally bankrupt and politically stupid,” Van Drew said, adding that he’s spoken to both Johnson and Trump about the issue. “We do need to do something.” But he acknowledged the fight will be “messy” — and that the longer Democrats refuse to back the spending bill, the less time they have to find a resolution. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York is another center-right Republican who is in favor of extending the subsidies in some fashion. But the Staten Island Republican said she — and the rest of the party — won’t support a simple extension as the Democrats are demanding. “This is really their mess. I think Republicans need to work with them to clean up their mess. But it needs to be something that’s comprehensive and reins in the insurance companies,” Malliotakis said. “It fell in our lap. There’s bipartisan support to do something here. If we open the government, we’ll be able to come to that resolution.” CNN’s Morgan Rimmer and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.", "tags": ["steadfast", "leaders", "stance", "gop", "party", "shutdown"]},
{"content": "President Donald Trump said Saturday that “we have identified funds” to pay military troops on October 15 as the government shutdown is headed into a third week. In a , Trump said he will “direct our Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th.” The funds for military paychecks will be pulled from the Pentagon’s research and development money that’s available for two years, according to a spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget. The Pentagon said in a statement that it “has identified approximately $8 billion of unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds” from the prior fiscal year that will be used to issue paychecks if the shutdown continues past October 15. The move to redirect funds that lawmakers have already appropriated could open the Trump administration up to legal challenges, because Congress holds the power of the purse. As service members were in danger of missing their first paychecks, congressional GOP leaders had of voting on a standalone bill for military pay, marking the most dramatic step yet to attempt to force Democrats to end the shutdown. Trump had that service members would still be paid despite the government shutdown. “We will get our service members every last penny.

{"content": "Top brass at the Department of Homeland Security approached the Federal Emergency Management Agency this spring with a proposal: What if the agency blocked millions of dollars in security grants awarded to Muslim organizations around the country? The suggestion of a blanket ban left the FEMA leaders bewildered and deeply concerned, and they immediately pointed out such a proposal could be considered discriminatory and even illegal, according to three sources with knowledge of the episode who asked not to be named out of fear of reprisal. While the DHS officials didn’t give a reason for disqualifying Muslim groups when they floated the idea, the Trump administration at the time was in the throes of dramatically downsizing the federal government. Ultimately, the idea was dropped. But six months later, dozens of those Muslim organizations     have been stripped of their eligibility for security funds that help protect against hate crimes and extremist attacks after DHS and the Department of Government Efficiency alleged that the groups have ties to terrorism. Five FEMA insiders — including those with knowledge of the proposal to block the funds — describe those allegations as questionable, given the standard vetting the groups undergo     and the unusual circumstances that led to their loss of funding. Some suggested that the allegations of terror ties, which they said came with little evidence, may be a pretext to justify the cuts. DHS, which oversees FEMA, denied to CNN that the department ever considered imposing a blanket ban on Muslim organizations receiving these security grants. “DHS and FEMA do not make policy decisions on the basis of religion,” a DHS  spokesperson wrote in a statement. “Such claims are ludicrous and deeply unserious.” The spokesperson said FEMA has been conducting an internal review of its grant recipients for months and has terminated funding to select groups found to have links to “terrorism or terrorist activities.” But sources who spoke to CNN say the efforts to block funds from Muslim organizations raise questions about equal treatment in federal grant programs and demonstrate the disproportionate impacts that the sometimes-chaotic attempts to reshape the US government can have. Several Muslim organizations contacted by CNN flatly denied any links to terrorist groups, suggesting they were singled out for political reasons. The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) said its FEMA security grant was abruptly rejected this summer with no explanation. Sources and internal documents obtained by CNN reveal that, behind the scenes, DOGE spearheaded efforts to block funding from dozens of groups — including ISNA — citing ties to terrorism. “We absolutely deny these allegations,” ISNA Executive Director Basharat Saleem told CNN. “This type of baseless information is very detrimental for civil society and for organizations that are doing good work.” At the center of the dispute is FEMA’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which provides funding for security upgrades such as surveillance cameras, bulletproof glass and security guards to thousands of nonprofit organizations, most of them religious institutions considered more vulnerable to hate crime attacks. In 2024, into the program amid a surge in both antisemitism and Islamophobia fueled by division over the ongoing war in Gaza. The funds were aimed at bolstering protections specifically for Jewish and Muslim institutions like synagogues, mosques, community groups and cultural centers. After Trump took office, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered FEMA to pause almost all of the agency’s grants, including these security grants, for officials from DHS and DOGE to carry out a sweeping “manual review” of the spending. FEMA grant funds totaling billions of dollars were effectively frozen as a result. By Spring, officials from DOGE and DHS were in discussions with FEMA leaders about unlocking the security grants, the three sources    told CNN. The administration was facing pressure from outside lobbying groups to expedite the release of funds to Jewish nonprofits, multiple sources said. However, resuming the program would have potentially awarded money to Muslim organizations as well. So, in April,   senior officials at DHS asked FEMA leadership how Muslim groups could be disqualified from receiving the funds, the sources told CNN. “I think they were worried about the optics of giving money to Muslim organizations,” one of the sources who heard the proposal firsthand told CNN, adding that a blanket ban would be “totally illegal and improper.” The FEMA leaders emphasized to DHS officials that the organizations had already been vetted and approved and should not lose their eligibility and potentially millions of dollars in funding. The conversations seemed to fizzle as FEMA leaders pushed back, warning DHS officials that a blanket ban of Muslim groups could cause significant legal and public blowback, the sources said. As the conversations were taking place and these grants were paused, thousands of nonprofits representing a wide range of faith groups – not just Muslim organizations – were waiting for the security funds to be approved, two of the sources told CNN. Among them: the Capital Jewish Museum   in Washington, DC, where a gunman killed a young Jewish couple in May in what authorities called an antisemitic attack. In late Spring, some of the funds were unlocked. DHS announced the first batch of nonprofit national security in June, which included the Capital Jewish Museum, a source told CNN. No Muslim nonprofits were included in the announcement. Around this time, scores of Muslim organizations, at DOGE’s direction, were quietly disqualified from the program. DOGE officials embedded inside DHS claimed to have intelligence indicating that more than 100 of these previously approved organizations had ties to terrorist groups, according to sources and documents reviewed by CNN. The officials   said the intel came from someone outside the agency but didn’t specify the origin. The White House, which oversees DOGE, referred CNN’s request for comment to FEMA. Again, officials inside FEMA were alarmed by the orders, saying they saw no clear evidence linking the nonprofits to terrorist entities. One source, a long-time FEMA official, questioned the unspecified outside intelligence cited by DOGE. “Everything about it seemed wrong,” the official said. “This felt like a manufactured narrative designed to justify excluding Muslim organizations from funding. What had always been an apolitical, risk-based grant process suddenly looked politicized in a way we’d never seen before.” The person said they had never witnessed government agencies taking “an overt action or effort to implement a blanket prohibition like we saw earlier this year” against Muslim groups — not even after 9/11, when they felt “‘Islamophobia’ was at an all-time high.” In a statement to CNN last week, DHS confirmed that it stripped funding from certain organizations, saying it did so after an internal review uncovered links to terrorism. A spokesperson said FEMA used “resources including the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and law enforcement” to determine that “multiple grant subrecipients had supported or were affiliated with organizations or individuals associated with terrorism or terrorist activities.” DHS said the department has improved its vetting process but declined to provide a full list of groups that lost eligibility and did not specify what new information led to their disqualification. The department did not respond to questions about DOGE’s involvement. The longtime FEMA official cast doubt on the validity of the department’s internal review given that previous administrations didn’t flag these organizations, some of which had received funds for years. “How did they not catch this during the first Trump administration?” the official asked. “The real question is, what has changed to prevent these types of organizations from being approved again?” Around the time that Muslim nonprofits were stripped of their grants, an outside group – the right-wing think tank Middle East Forum – also raised allegations about terrorist ties. The forum published a lengthy report claiming DHS and FEMA have been distributing millions of dollars each year to dozens of Muslim organizations with alleged ideological and monetary ties to al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The pro-Israel Middle East Forum has been criticized by various groups, including the Southern Poverty Law Center and Center for American Progress. Some have accused it of spreading anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian views, and of backing policies that unfairly target Muslim communities in the name of national security. Defenders  argue that its efforts are aimed at confronting extremist political Islam, not the religion. After the report’s publication, DOGE circulated it to FEMA staff, instructing them to ensure that none of the nonprofits named would receive funding, according to two sources. Once again, FEMA leaders were concerned, questioning the so-called evidence in the report. “If you read the report, it’s rather shallow on facts,” a former high-ranking FEMA official said. In July, a DHS spokesperson sent CNN a statement touting the department’s effort to withhold funding from “groups with questionable ties.” When CNN asked for specifics, the spokesperson pointed to the Middle East Forum report and a Fox News story that claimed DHS had cancelled dozens of grants in the wake of the think tank’s findings. But now, DHS insists the think tank wasn’t involved in the department’s funding cuts. In an email last week, a spokesperson said FEMA staff have “methodically reviewed” grant recipients for months – “well before” the forum published its report. Several organizations named in the Middle East Forum report have been under scrutiny for years, said Lorenzo Vidino, director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. “I’m not suggesting that these are terrorist supporting organizations, but if they have questionable views and ties, I think that’s fair to say, and I think the bar of what entities the government should be supporting should be set higher,” Vidino said. “Some of the entities in the report are well-known, not just to the academic community, but to law enforcement, as being problematic.” Still, Vidino added that each case should be considered individually, and that funding should be withdrawn only if there is clear evidence. More than half a dozen groups named in the Middle East Forum report contacted by CNN denied the think tank’s allegations, pointing to what they described as the forum’s long history of Islamophobic rhetoric – a characterization the MEF disputes. The Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center, which MEF claimed is “arguably one of the most prominent outposts for radical Islam in North America” said this was “a complete lie,” adding: “Whatever the hate that some people are spewing against Islam or the Muslim community, we cannot stop them.” Criticisms of Dar Al-Hijrah when the Northern Virginia mosque was accused of hosting terrorists, including the 9/11 hijackers. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, labeled in the report as an “extremist group” with alleged ties to Hamas, pushed back forcefully against the report’s claims. It also warned that if DHS is quietly blacklisting organizations without thoroughly vetting accusations — whether from DOGE, the Middle East Forum, or others — it marks a deeply troubling erosion of due process. “The government cannot ban American Muslim nonprofit organizations from receiving federal grants because of their religious identity” or other political reasons, CAIR said in a statement to CNN. “Doing so places American Muslim institutions at increased risk during a time of rising hate.” Middle East Forum, which responded to CNN after this story published, defended the report’s findings. “The report speaks for itself,” Executive Director Gregg Roman said. “It is deeply sourced.” Roman dismissed years of criticism aimed at the group, saying, “We have no issue with Islam whatsoever. Our issue is the juxtaposition of Islamist groups that are operating under the false banner of civil rights groups.” He also insisted that MEF did not work with DOGE or DHS on the report, but said their goal was to shape government policy. In August, Roman warned: “MEF is watching — whether the money is intended for foreign aid, public education, or homeland security — and we will not rest until every last cent allocated to terrorist-aligned groups is returned to American taxpayers.”", "tags": ["muslim", "security", "trump", "funding", "fema", "administration", "block", "groups"]},
{"content": "Federal prosecutors are meeting on Saturday to finalize the details of a potential indictment against former national security adviser John Bolton, who has been under criminal investigation for years related to his handling of national security information, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Prosecutors in the Maryland US Attorney’s Office previously pushed back against Justice Department political leadership from the Deputy Attorney General’s Office who wanted Bolton to be charged late last month, CNN previously reported. The prosecutors had sought more time to firm up a case by the end of the year. But as of Saturday, the Maryland-based team has lifted their objections and are working on the charges this weekend, the source told CNN Saturday. The Justice Department has also had internal discussions over whether Bolton, a well-known critic of Trump, would be “perp walked,” or arrested in a way where he could be seen on cameras, the source said. The meeting comes seven weeks after federal agents removed documents and electronics from Bolton’s home and office in court-approved searches. The inquiry around Bolton’s handling of national defense records has existed for years, even predating President Donald Trump’s second term in the presidency. But the charges, if filed, would come amid a spate of indictments of government officials who Trump perceives as enemies and has publicly said he would like to see in court. A spokesperson for Bolton declined to comment. Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Bolton, has maintained he did nothing inappropriate with classified records, and said records with classified markings found in his possession during the recent searches were decades old. A Justice Department spokesman also declined to comment on Saturday. Bolton served as Trump’s national security adviser in his first term, but the president fired him in 2019 and the two have been sharply at odds ever since. Trump during his first term called for Bolton to be punished after the longtime national security expert released a politically damaging book in 2020 about Trump’s handling of foreign policy and foreign leaders. The searches this year related to, in part, a reopened, years-old investigation involving Bolton’s book manuscript, which federal officials at first told him contained classified information. Yet investigators are also exploring other possible leaks. Federal investigators seized multiple documents labeled “secret,” “confidential,” and “classified,” including some about weapons of mass destruction, during the late August search of Bolton’s office, now-public court records regarding the search say. The federal agents also took four computers and a USB flash drive from Bolton’s office, as well as a collection of drives, phones, computers and documents labeled as referring to “allied strikes” and “Trump I-IV” from his Bethesda, Maryland, house, which the FBI searched on the same day. Bolton, 76, has maintained a private office since 2014 for political and policy work, according to public filings. Some of the reasons for the searches relate to what federal authorities know about a foreign adversary hacking Bolton’s email years ago, according to the court record. Trump’s Justice Department has been aggressive in its charging decisions lately – with a handpicked, inexperienced, newly appointed US attorney in Northern Virginia securing indictments of Trump foes James Comey, the former FBI director, and Letitia James, the New York attorney general, in the past three weeks. The Bolton case is viewed by prosecutors within the Justice Department as different than the Comey and James cases, which have faced more internal pushback, multiple sources tell CNN. The Bolton investigators this August, for instance, convinced federal judges in Maryland and Washington, DC, that they had collected enough evidence to search Bolton’s home and workspace, with the belief that those searches would turn up records that could become evidence of a crime in the investigation. When asked about the Bolton investigation recently, Trump has said he didn’t want to know about Justice Department decision making. He didn’t mention Bolton, either, in a recent social media post directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi pushing for her to charge Comey, James and a Democratic senator. Comey has pleaded not guilty to lying charges he faces related to past congressional testimony. James has not yet formally entered a plea to charges of misleading banks on mortgage documents, but has said she is unfairly being prosecuted by Trump’s Justice Department because of his political vendetta. Bolton hasn’t been charged with any crime. He and James share a criminal defense attorney.", "tags": ["prosecutors", "weekend", "federal", "finalize", "potential", "meeting", "indictment"]},

{"content": "Financial files in disarray. Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases. When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed . Researchers at the who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person’s average credit scores may start to weaken and their payment delinquencies rise. “The harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,” the researchers wrote. “Beyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.” Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the . Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are “not remotely shocking.” Tidwell’s mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since. Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an “outrageously methodical human being” who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military. After going through her mother’s papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother’s memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became “less than pristine.” For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. “There was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding — she knew things weren’t all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.” Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers. Her father was a former finance executive who “was very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,” she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest. Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn’t need, just months before police took away his driver’s license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said. What’s more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties. “I spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn’t paid them,” Lemay said. Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it. Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care. “The most challenging thing we faced was managing mum’s everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didn’t need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone — a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,” Sibley said. Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked. Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father’s situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care. While her mother’s condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties. To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week’s worth of cash for their mother “but she’d spend it all in one go,” she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes. Eventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. “She wasn’t able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. That’s when we realized there has to be a better way.” With her husband, she founded , which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a person’s condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store). While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person’s finances when they become incapacitated. In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise. That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother’s bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her mother’s bill paying online. “The time to make plans is you need to. It’s hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to ‘future me,’” said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother’s finances now that her condition has worsened considerably. Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia. Of course, no amount of can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline. “I prepared as best as I could, but it’s still hard,” Tidwell said. That’s why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, “make the easy part easy.”", "tags": ["signs", "finances", "show"]},
{"content": "Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation. Now that inflation has and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September. If it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others. Given how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response. The prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcome news to those seeking loans or anyone trying to reduce their existing debt loads. But, realistically, how much you’ll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time. The answer for the near term is most likely to be “not that much.” “Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. By that he means: “Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],” McBride said. “And for savers, [the initial declines] won’t wipe out your interest earnings. Savers will still be way ahead of the game.” That’s because one or even two quarter-point rate cuts this year won’t meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs. But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then. “Don’t jump the gun too early on this stuff,” said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning. Here’s a breakdown of how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips from Diodato and McBride on what to do about it. Getting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people ever make. Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of economic factors, and the Fed’s moves are one. Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small cuts in interest rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay. For those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate. Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you may be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further. That’s because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance. To buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said. To refi, the costs could be higher — they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree. Given that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25% in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over 2% or 3%, Diodato sees it this way: “Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn’t stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle. So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.” As for taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it’s no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%. A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won’t make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said. “Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it. Just because you have equity doesn’t make it free money.” Of course, if you’re just taking out a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern. But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted. And if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, “aggressively pay it down. It’s high-cost debt that won’t get cheaper soon.” Another perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balance . A few rate cuts won’t make much of a dent in today’s record-high average rate of 20.7%. Even if rate cuts ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 — 16.3% — it will still be a pricey loan. That’s why, if you’re carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe. If that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks. “They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,” Dodiato said. If you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think. McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car. So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year. “Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you’re financing and your credit rating,” he said. As for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called “money factor” you will pay to lease, and because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates. The past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts, many of which have been paying north of 5%. The same goes for those who could lock up their cash for certain periods of time in certificates of deposits or Treasuries, many durations of which were also paying north of 5%. While those rates will start to come down when the Fed starts cutting rates, the drops aren’t likely to be huge at first — meaning you will still be able to earn more on your savings than the rate of inflation for a while, McBride predicts. But it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward. “I caution people against the cash trap. A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,” said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years. His advice: Don’t keep more than six months’ to a year’s worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents. “Anything more than that and you’re putting a drag on your future net worth,” he said. That said, McBride suggested that if you’re within five years of retirement, you might want to lock in some high rates still on offer today to grow the cash you’ll want to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working. Having that cash on hand means you won’t be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big . For instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com. If you do opt for such a longer-term CD, try to find one that is not “callable.” A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years. “The call feature is a ‘Heads I win, tails you lose’ for the issuing bank,” McBride said.", "tags": ["starts", "smart", "moves", "rates"]},

Megan Rathmell thought she’d bombed her job interview earlier this year, assuming her nervousness and lack of preparation had cost her the opportunity. The 20-year-old later found out she got the job as a paralegal — and what made her stand out was her ability to do two important things: maintain eye contact and carry on a conversation. “My boss told me that I was a good communicator and that I was able to make strong eye contact, and that he hasn’t seen this from a lot of my peers,” said Rathmell, who is based in Virginia. “That was really surprising to me.” What Rathmell learned from her boss mirrors what hiring managers say: Some Gen Z college graduates are unprepared for job interviews or behave unprofessionally during job interviews. They bring parents to in-person interviews, refuse to turn the camera on during virtual interviews, use inappropriate language, dress unprofessionally and struggle to make eye contact. While there have always been people who interviewed badly for jobs, “it does seem to be more prevalent today,” said Dr. Nathan Mondragon, chief innovation officer at the hiring platform HireVue. There could be several factors contributing to the problem. The digital age has made many people less experienced with in-person interactions and therefore less comfortable with them especially challenging ones. Pandemic safety precautions only made that worse, Mondragon said. And while some parents are overinvolved in their child’s professional pursuits, others aren’t teaching them how to navigate the professional world without parental handholding. Some people think they can just wing a job interview, said Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder. But just like anything else you want to be successful at, getting a job also requires preparation. There will be plenty of competition for those jobs, as released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday shows. The number of employed people increased by 254,000 in September, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, according to BLS data on nonfarm payroll employment. (That excludes people working as farmers, nonprofit or private household employees, and more.) There are about 6.8 million people who currently want a job — so here’s what you should do before, during and after an interview to stand out and get the job you want. Before you get an interview, you need to stand out from hundreds of other applicants, and you have about six seconds to catch a recruiter’s eye , Haller said. Therefore, your resume should be one compelling, clear and uncrowded page that is tailored to the position and highlights why you’re the best candidate. Be careful who you get advice from, Haller said. If you know other people who work at the company or in similar industries, consulting them could be good. Parents and other people their age, however, likely have good intentions but may have not interviewed for a job in decades or ever worked in your industry, and the workforce is different now. Unless you’ve gone to a specialty school, your college or graduate school career center may not have employees with any experience in hiring people, so it’s not always helpful, Haller said. Look the career center employees up online to see if they have a relevant track record. One of the biggest mistakes some interviewees make is asking questions about things they could have easily found by looking at just the homepage of a company’s website, said Dr. Nicolas Roulin, professor of industrial/organizational psychology at Saint Mary’s University in Canada. That, as well as not asking any questions at all, tells the interviewer you haven’t done your homework and probably don’t care about the job. Thoroughly research the company, experts said. You must be able to answer the question, “Why do you want to work here?” and express how you can contribute to the company’s values, culture, strategies, goals and more. By researching the interviewers, as well — if you have their names — you can ask them more in-depth questions about their job, goals and lives, and you may even find you have a fun personal connection to bring up, such as having attended the same school. Websites such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor can help you find some of this information. Glassdoor reviews are typically left by current or former employees. During the interview, you’ll also need to demonstrate how well you fit, and can perform, the job description. You can prepare by writing down your success stories for each requirement within that description, using . That acronym stands for situation, task, action and result — define the situation, what task needed to be accomplished, what actions you took alone or as part of a team to do so, and what the results were. Your questions are just as important as your answers, and they should show interest, motivation and care, as well as what’s important to you, experts said. Here are some examples, which you can practice on your own or in mock interviews with friends or family: If you struggle with nervousness before interviews, relaxation or , Roulin said. Experiencing more severe anxiety . Dressing professionally for both in-person and virtual interviews is important regardless of whether it’s for a fast-food restaurant, retail store or office job, experts said. — no jeans, shorts, flip-flops or overly revealing clothing. If the company culture is more casual, that doesn’t automatically mean you should dress like them for your interview, Haller said. Those employees have already had the chance to show over time that they do great work despite how they’re dressed, but they don’t know you yet. You need to make a good impression that shows you’re respectful and serious. At the same time, don’t go overboard by wearing a three-piece suit and appearing totally out of touch, Haller said — unless that’s the dress code. Bring all those notes you prepared to the interview, but don’t bring your parents. That can imply immaturity and incapability, and you’re the one who needs to be able to do the job without them. Where you do the interview is also important. The setting should be as distraction- and noise-free as possible, so avoid conducting it from a public space, such as a coffeeshop. Turning your camera off is generally inappropriate, experts said, and it can suggest you’re hiding something or uncomfortable dealing with people — which is obviously a concerning red flag since most jobs require dealing with people. If you for a question, ask the interviewer to rephrase or say “I don’t have much experience with that particular issue, but I can tell you about a time when X.” You can also say you would like an opportunity to really think about the question if they would let you get back to them with an answer. These alternatives show you’re adaptable, and they allow you to show off in other ways. When you’re given the chance to ask questions, ask what you’ve prepared. But save questions about salary, availability expectations and vacation benefits for a point towards the end of the interview, Mondragon said. These questions are important for your survival and quality of life, something Gen Z cares more about than previous generations — which is a great thing, he added. Some states, such as Colorado and New York, have even required that job postings state the salary. But you don’t want to appear to care more about not working than working. you ask also matters. “Can you tell me about the company’s benefits packages for employees at this level?” sounds better than “How many days off do I get?” At the end, ask if there’s anything else you could provide to show you’re a great candidate for the position, Haller said. “You want to overcome any objections. And then you always want to ask about the next steps and express your interest.” Within 24 hours after the interview, email a thank you note expressing gratitude for the interviewer’s time and the opportunity, Haller said. But know that your message is more than a thank you note — it’s also an indirect reminder to hire you. If you get a call for another interview or a job offer, respond as immediately as possible, experts said. Even if you’re no longer interested, you should still quickly communicate that, too — it’s the respectful thing to do, and you don’t want to burn any bridges you may need to cross again in the future. Do not follow up with an employer about whether there’s any news before the time they said they’ll be in touch, Roulin said. After that is when you can check in once a week. If a month or two go by, no response from them is your answer, Haller said — and you shouldn’t work for companies that treat people that way.

{"content": "It’s April 15 — otherwise known as “Tax Day” in the United States. While the IRS has already received a majority of the 2024 federal income tax returns typically filed by Tax Day — 101.422 million as of April 4, to be precise — US tax filers are expected to send in tens of millions more by today. But the agency also expects to receive millions more returns in the months ahead due to the automatic extensions the IRS granted to people in federally declared disaster areas. At current count, all residents and businesses in seven states have already been granted filing and payment extensions, on top of people in select areas of other states. More on that below. Plus, millions of individual filers have requested — or will request today — automatic six-month filing extensions because they won’t make the April 15 deadline. If you are racing to file your return today — or think you won’t make it in time — here are some last-minute tips to keep in mind. If you’re starting cold, make sure you pull together all the documents you’ll need to fill out your return. You’ll want to look for income reporting forms from your employer (a for your earnings) or from your clients if you’re (a or ). You may even get a from any payment apps you use like Venmo if you received payments for your goods or services. If you are receiving any income distributions from an IRA or pension, you should have a . Also look for other 1099 forms from your bank and brokerage for other types of income you received during the year (e.g., interest, dividends and capital gains). All these forms will have been sent to you by mail, electronically or both. Consider, too, any major changes that took place in your life in 2024 that could affect your taxes either through new tax breaks or new types of reportable income — for instance, if you got married, had children, received alimony, started a small business on the side, bought or sold a home, inherited an IRA or collected unemployment benefits. Most filers now take the standard deduction — a flat amount you deduct from your income ($14,600 for single filers and those who are married filing separately; $29,200 for married couples filing jointly; and $21,900 for head-of-household filers). But if the standard deduction amounts to less than the total of the value of itemized deductions you’re eligible to take (e.g., state and local taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, etc.) you . If you do, gather the documentation you will need to back up those deductions (e.g. a for mortgage interest from your lender, contribution receipts from charities, etc.). Speaking of deductions, if you qualify to deduct contributions to a traditional tax-deferred IRA, you can put away up to $7,000 ($8,000 if you’re 50 or older) by 11:59 pm on April 15 and still have it count as your 2024 contribution. Since it’s an “above-the-line deduction” you’re allowed to take it even if you claim the standard deduction. Here are the eligibility rules if you and . If you have a fairly straightforward tax situation with a household income below $250,000, and if you take the standard deduction and only a handful of credits pertaining mostly to family, you may be eligible to use the .

The program works on mobile phones, laptops, tablets or desktop computers. And it will help guide you to fill out your state tax return, too. You also can using one of several private-sector tax preparation software . These free filing options, however, are for those with adjusted gross incomes of $84,000 or less. Other eligibility criteria may apply. Whether you’re preparing your return on your own, working with a tax preparer or using Direct File, you always want to double check that everything is correct on your return before submitting it.

And if you’re due a refund, those errors could delay that money getting to you. If possible, electronically file your return, which is generally considered to be safer and faster, according to the .

If you think you still owe money to the IRS for tax year 2024, it must be paid by Tuesday, even if you request a filing extension. One way to ballpark whether you still do is to multiply your 2024 income by 20% and make sure that you have already paid that much, according to Tom O’Saben, director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Professionals. If you haven’t, send the IRS the difference. Send that payment no later than 11:59 pm tonight. If you’re mailing it, do so by , so you’ll have confirmation that it was sent and received. If you can’t pay all that you owe, pay however much you can by April 15, then explore the you can make with the IRS. If you don’t file and haven’t requested an extension — or if you don’t pay the rest of what you owe the IRS for 2024 today — you may be subject to a failure-to-file penalty equal to 5% of the balance you owe plus interest for every month you don’t file; and/or a failure-to-pay penalty equal to to 0.5% of what you owe plus interest every month until you pay in full.", "tags": ["day", "tax", "extension", "tips"]},

{"content": "Its name is Courtney. Courtney doesn’t have eyes, but it’s got sensors everywhere. There are two blinking lights on the front of its boxy body to approximate wide, moony pupils. It’s been as a “large cooler on four wheels.” Courtney is a food delivery robot from Serve Robotics, transporting Uber Eats orders typically when there’s a mile or less between a restaurant and a customer. Courtney showed up in my Atlanta neighborhood one day toward the end of June with dozens of other four-wheeled bots with names like Deandre and Orion. Courtney and the bots have had some trouble navigating Atlanta. They get confused at crosswalks. They move with the speed and caution of a first-time driver, stilted and shy, until they suddenly speed up without warning. Their four wheels look like they were made for off-roading, but they still get stuck in the cracks of craggy sidewalks. Most times I see the bots, they aren’t moving at all. When they first got here, they were objects of curiosity. People took pictures of them and made TikToks when they spotted them on the street for the first time — the future is now! Three months after their arrival, though, the novelty has worn off. They’re not photo ops anymore. Cyclists swerve to avoid them like any other obstacle in the road. Patrons of Shake Shack (a national partner of Serve) weave around the mess of robots parked in front of the restaurant to make their way inside and place orders on iPads. They’re as much an accepted part of life in my neighborhood as the obnoxious scooters that litter sidewalks. “I think folks are always asking, ‘When are robots finally here?’ They really are finally here,” Serve Robotics CEO Ali Kashani told me. “If you’re lucky to live in one of these cities, you see it today. If not, probably in a couple of years, it will be something that everybody will have seen in their environment.” The dawn of everyday, “friendly” robots may be here, but they haven’t proven themselves useful — or trustworthy — yet. “People think they are your friends, but they’re actually cameras and microphones of corporations,” said Joanna Bryson, a longtime AI scholar and professor of ethics and technology at the Hertie School in Berlin. “You’re right to be nervous.” Edward Ongweso Jr. is a researcher at the Security in Context initiative, a tech journalist and a self-proclaimed “decel.” (That’s short for “decelerationist,” or someone who thinks Silicon Valley tech pioneers need to slow their roll, as do the leaders who quickly embrace untested and unregulated technology.) He told me skepticism toward new technology is healthy. . When robots show up in a city, it’s often because the residents of said city actively wanted them there or had a say in their arrival, he said. “They’re being rolled out without any sort of input from people, and as a result, in ways that are annoying and inconvenient,” Ongweso Jr. said. “I suspect that people would feel a lot differently if they had a choice … ‘what kind of robots are we interested in rolling out in our homes, in our workplaces, on our college campuses or in our communities?’” Delivery robots aren’t unique to Atlanta. AI-driven companies including Avride and Coco Robotics have sent fleets of delivery robots to big cities like Chicago, Dallas and Jersey City, as well as sleepy college towns. Uber and Lyft now offer self-driving cars — in my city, driverless Waymos are so popular that people are canceling rides until they’re paired with an autonomous vehicle, Business Insider. “They’re popping up everywhere,” Ongweso Jr. continued, “because there’s sort of a realization that you have to convince people to view them as inevitable. The way to do that is to just push it into as many places as possible, and have these spectacle demonstrations, get some friendly coverage, try to figure out the ways in which you’re selling this as the only alternative.” The robots have gotten plenty of since arriving in Atlanta They are also on Netflix: On “Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney,” the comedian cast a as a foil to sidekick Richard Kind. (Kashani assures me that the robot that was an Evel Knievel-style jump was fake; the real robot was unscathed.) They’ve even been used as literal vehicles for activism: In 2023, Serve rainbow-painted robot Marsha, named for trans rights activist . I asked Kashani whether the bots have cute names and fake LED peepers to endear them to people and hopefully make them less kickable. If a silly moniker like Clifford and a protect a robot from abuse, that’s an upside, but it’s not the point, he said. “We want the robots to be friendly and fun and embraced by the communities they go to,” he said. “But also, why not have some fun? We’re making robots. This has been a dream for humanity for like, four to five decades. It’s a wasted opportunity not to have fun.” But the bots are products, first and foremost, not friends, Ongweso Jr. said. The success of Courtney and Deandre and the rest makes investors money. “If you humanize it, you’re more willing to entertain it and rationalize it being in your area — ‘That’s just Jeffrey,’ or whatever they name it — instead of seeing it for what it is, which is a bunch of investors privately encroaching on a community or workplace,” Ongweso Jr. said. “It’s not the future. It’s a business model.” To give the bots the benefit of the doubt, I tried to employ them. I ordered delivery from Uber Eats one dozen times in two months, each time from restaurants I easily could’ve walked to but didn’t in hopes that Courtney or Deandre or a compatriot would pick up my food instead. They never came, but very efficient human cyclists did, typically in 15 minutes or less. I live about one-third of a mile away from the hub where many of the four-wheelers hang out, but I still haven’t scored a robot courier. It’s hard to know how successful these bot deliveries are when they’re almost never seen in motion. “They’re betting that, since this is a convenience thing, this is a luxury service, you can provide something that maybe is worse than what a human would provide, but because you’re still getting your new treat, you’re fine with it,” Ongweso Jr. posited. Serve launched its robots in Atlanta in an attempt to reduce traffic in a city where most residents use cars to get around, Kashani told me. Its robots’ average delivery distance in the city is under a mile, and it takes them about 18 minutes to make their deliveries, according to Serve. They’re supposed to do fine in extreme heat and snow, though have had to rescue them when they’ve been felled by weather. “They’re going to make cities safer, reduce emissions, help merchants make delivery more accessible to more folks,” Kashani said. Robot delivery is also likely cheaper for consumers for one crucial reason, he said: “You don’t have to tip the robots.” But Serve launched its first fleets in Atlanta’s most walkable neighborhoods, where there are dozens of restaurants within walking distance of an 50,000 residents. These neighborhoods are also among the wealthiest in Atlanta. Do we really need bots ? After a few weeks of ranting against the bots to friends, coworkers and sources, I started to wonder whether my loathing was misplaced. Perhaps I should aim my ire at more immediately nefarious forms of AI, like , whose to is already well-documented, or at companies like Uber, who don’t have to pay as many employees if there are robots who work for free doing their jobs. Dylan Losey, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech who studies human-robot interaction, said there’s nothing inherently wrong with delivery robots. “If we can create robots that do a boring, repetitive task for humans — like delivering food — then I think we’re moving in the right direction,” he wrote in an email. “However, I am skeptical about how these robots interact with people.” What troubles him, he said, is that the AI algorithms that run these robots are “completely unregulated.” “We don’t know if a third party has checked the hardware and software and deemed the system ‘safe’ — in part because what it means for these systems to be ‘safe’ is not fully understood or standardized,” Losey said. “The people who interact with delivery robots are basically put in a position where they have to trust that the robots are built and programmed with our best interests at heart.” I made one final attempt to court a bot courier toward the end of September when I came across 10 of them parked outside Shake Shack, no longer completely obstructing the entrance. Dallas and Clyde had their “on delivery” flags up; Deirdre was advertising the latest “Sonic the Hedgehog” sequel. Surely, ordering right next to them, from Shake Shack, would work this time. I sat six feet away from the small army of bots for 20 minutes and none of them moved to deliver, for me or for anyone. I adjusted my delivery location to the very spot where I sat. I even tried setting the tip to $0, which should improve one’s chances of scoring a bot deliverer, but that only made it more difficult to convince a human to pick up an order I immediately regretted placing. (I couldn’t set a tip for my human driver again until after those sad cheese fries arrived.) The bots are more annoying than directly harmful, I recognize, though they caused an elsewhere last month: In Los Angeles, one of the first major cities where Serve robots deployed, a man with cerebral palsy filmed a bot repeatedly swerving in his path and blocking the sidewalk, eventually resulting in a collision with his mobility scooter. I’ve identified my fear of these ostensibly harmless bots: As the use of this technology spreads, will we depend more on robots than people — and what will become of the people whose livelihoods are affected by our antisocial practices?

And they seem to have genuinely won people over — Serve regularly shares of people hugging its bots or cheerfully greeting them as they share a sidewalk.

{"content": "Chris Zephro’s warehouse full of latex masks, “Saw” movie props, and zombie apocalypse games is a testament to his love of horror. “Horror is not necessarily Halloween. It’s really a lifestyle,” Zephro said. But the fake blood inside his Santa Cruz, California, warehouse pales in comparison to the real-life cash bleed from his business ever since the Trump administration launched a trade war with China last spring. Zephro’s company, Trick or Trick Studios, produces and imports goods that are sold to more than 10,000 retailers around the world, 65% in the United States. He has paid upwards of $800,000 in tariff costs so far this year. The Halloween and Costume Association said roughly 90% of Halloween products contain at least one component made overseas, most often in China. That cost has forced Zephro to lay off 15 employees for the first time since he co-founded his company 15 years ago, which he calls “one of the worst days of my life.” “I mean, these are friends of mine. I know their families and I’m hoping to bring them back,” said Zephro, who is also treasurer of the Halloween and Costume Association. “Unfortunately, at the end of the day the business survives or it doesn’t. And I know of a number of companies in our industry that have had to close their doors.” President Donald Trump on most Chinese goods from about 20% to 145% in April, before in May. Many production orders were halted in April since importers decided it would be too costly to bring them into the US for the Halloween season. As a result, this year’s Halloween inventory will be tighter, and things will cost more.  Halloween shoppers can expect to spend a record $114.45 per person this season, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), $11 more than last year. The Trump administration told CNN that real prosperity is “good jobs” and “booming industry,” not “cheap Chinese imports.” “President Trump pledged to use tariffs to level the playing field, address fentanyl smuggling, and restore American Greatness,” White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Rising real wages, historic trade deals, and trillions in investment commitments to make and hire in America prove that President Trump’s America First agenda is paying off for the American people in the ways that matter most.” Zephro, however, said Trump’s policies hurt US businesses like his. “I would love to have a conversation closed doors with Trump, because he’s not an idiot. He took the same classes in business school that I took, so let’s drop the veil,” he said. “This is Economics 101. Tariffs are paid by importers.” Reyna Hernandez is piecing together a costume for her six-year-old son, who wants to dress as Carl from “The Walking Dead” for Halloween. She found an appropriate hat at Phantom Halloween in Northridge, California, but it cost $30. “It’s just ridiculous. We cannot even afford this at all. Like, a lot of people are not going to be able to afford a costume this year,” Hernandez said, who is buying the pieces one at a time to spread out the cost. An NRF survey found that 79% of Halloween shoppers expect to pay higher prices this year due to tariffs. Importers like Zephro absorb some of the initial cost – he said he takes on 60% to 70% – with the rest passed on to his retail customers, like Phantom Halloween’s Ryan Goldman. Goldman then must decide how much of that to charge customers like Hernandez. “The idea is to hold as many prices as we can knowing that because of tariffs, things are going to go up,” Goldman said. “But we don’t want (higher prices) to be 100% across the board. That’s not fair.” Costumes will likely cost customers $5-10 more this year, Goldman said. He said he’s trying to keep the price of child costumes the same, while boosting the price of adult costumes. Prices for items produced outside of China, however, may not see much of a price increase, if at all. For example, Zephro uses a Mexican factory to produce his latex masks, which are currently not subject to tariffs since they fall under an earlier trade agreement. Goldman said some makeup will stay the same price because they’re made in Vietnam, India or the U.K. But both decided some pieces are not worth selling this year due to import costs. Goldman didn’t order huge, complicated props and décor this year, like the large animatronic on display in his store called “Cagey the Clown.” The 6.5-ft tall clown holding a screaming child in a cage is a holdover from last year, selling at $399.99. This year, it would have cost customers closer to $600. Zephro also stopped production on a series of one-sixth scale action figures since they would be unsellable at higher price points. The ones he imported before tariffs are all that’s left for now. “Until maybe the midterms,” Zephro said. Even if prices are holding steady for some items, the stress of tariffs is hurting every part of the Halloween industry. The Halloween and Costume Association told CNN in an email the situation has caused significant concern particularly for “smaller manufacturers that lack the scale to mitigate cost pressures or shift operations domestically. The barriers to reshoring manufacturing are substantial, ranging from infrastructure costs and regulatory burdens to raw material availability.” Zephro said small and medium-sized businesses like his depend on factories that are mostly overseas because regulations and taxes make manufacturing in the US difficult. “If you really want manufacturing to come back here, you have to look at why manufacturing left and start there,” he said. “And then incentivize companies to manufacture, not penalize them for using factories that don’t exist here anymore.” Goldman, whose family started Phantom Halloween in the 1980s, has seen all kinds of outside forces hit the business over the decades, from recessions to natural disasters to Covid-19. This year alone had wildfires and then tariffs, just as he thought inflation was behind him. “Turns out things are kind of costing slightly more,” he said. So all Goldman can do this Halloween is try to keep cost increases as small as possible for his customers. “I’m not that political, so we just are dealing with the aftermath of it. The aftermath isn’t pretty because it’s going to create a financial strain on a lot of families,” he said.", "tags": ["trump", "industry", "tariffs"]},
{"content": "A comedy festival in Saudi Arabia featuring high-profile American performers is drawing intense criticism from ﻿human rights advocates who say the star-studded event helps gloss over the kingdom’s ongoing human rights abuses. The Riyadh Comedy Festival, which kicked off on September 26, has styled itself as “ ,” with sets from more than 50 star comedians, including Kevin Hart, Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr and Pete Davidson. Running through October 9, the festival was organized by the Saudi Tourism Authority as part of the kingdom’s push to attract more visitors. The festival also falls during the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Washington Post columnist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, ﻿which a US intelligence report says happened Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. That timing hasn’t been lost on the festival’s critics, who say the high-profile American comics are lending legitimacy to a government that represses dissent, jails activists and restricts free speech. Marc Maron ridiculed the festival performers and the crown prince in , noting that “the same guy that’s gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bonesaw Jamal Khashoggi … but don’t let that stop the yuks!” “I am disgusted, and deeply disappointed in this whole gross thing,” comedian David Cross on his website. “You’re performing for literally the most oppressive regime on earth.” , a fellow irreverent comedian, said he “took a principled stand” against accepting a “significant” offer to perform. Atsuko Okatsuka of the festival’s offer — which she said she rejected — that included a prohibition on making jokes or derogatory remarks about Saudi Arabia, religion or the royal family. Some of the invited comedians have publicly defended the festival, citing America’s own free speech issues, the opportunity to bring comedy to a socially conservative country or simply the allure of a big paycheck. “Right now in America, they say that if you talk about Charlie Kirk, that you’ll get canceled,” Dave Chappelle said during his Saturday set, . “It’s easier to talk here than it is in America.” Last month, comedian Jim Jefferies to podcaster Theo Von: “One reporter was killed by the (Saudi) government — unfortunate, but not a f–king hill that I’m gonna die on.” Pete Davidson, whose father died in the 9/11 terror attacks, was more direct about the financial incentives: “I just know I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, ‘I’ll go,’” . After his performance in Riyadh, Bill Burr that it was a “mind-blowing” experience. “You think everybody’s going to be screaming ‘Death to America’ and they’re going to have like f–king machetes and want to chop my head off,” he said. “Because this is what I’ve been fed about that part of the world.” Instead, Burr said, “They just wanted to laugh.” “That there appears to be more freedom in the country is definitely true, but the reality is that Saudi Arabia remains an absolute authoritarian dictatorship where voices that criticize the government, criticize the royal family, criticize the economic performance of the public investment fund literally face decades and decades in prison,” Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now, a non-profit founded by Khashoggi in 2018, told CNN. “Superficial observation based on a few days in the city is really just a pathetic and ignorant observation, ignoring the fact that at this moment Saudi men and women are literally in solitary confinement facing sentences of decades,” Whitson added. Chappelle, Burr, Davidson and Jefferies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In recent years, the Saudi government has sought to rehabilitate its global image through its state-owned sovereign wealth fund, using cultural initiatives such as the Riyadh Comedy Festival as tools of soft power. Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at the Baker Institute for Public Policy, told CNN that Saudi Arabia has “used the soft power and mass appeal of sport, in particular, to generate a global awareness that a process of change is underway.” Since 2016, the kingdom’s fund has and , injected , and it with rival PGA Tour, and . (The Uber and Penske Media investments came prior to the killing of Khashoggi.) Despite those efforts, human rights advocates continue to sound the alarm about Saudi Arabia. Ahead of the comedy festival, the kingdom was using comedy to “deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations.” “American comics heading to Riyadh might pause to consider that only three months ago, Saudi journalist Turki al-Jasser was executed for exercising his right to free speech in the same satirical way that they do on stage,” Abdullah Alaoudh, the senior director for countering authoritarianism at the Middle East Democracy Center. Indeed, on the anniversary of Khashoggi’s killing, the Riyadh festival stands in stark contrast with the state of speech in the country. Saad Almadi, a 75-year-old dual US-Saudi citizen, after previously being imprisoned and tortured over X posts about the crown prince, including one about Khashoggi’s murder. that “independent media are non-existent in Saudi Arabia, and Saudi journalists live under heavy surveillance, even when abroad.” Whitson suggested that while her late friend Khashoggi “would be very happy to see the Saudi people having an opportunity to laugh,” he would also have “hated the fact that these comedians were participating in this kind of comedy festival, voluntarily agreeing for money to zip their lips and bow their heads to the crown prince.” “It is the very antithesis of why he came to the United States,” Whitson continued, “why he fled to the United States, and ultimately why Saudi Arabia murdered him.”", "tags": ["backlash", "draw", "american", "festival", "comedians", "saudi", "rights", "human", "groups"]},

Global Witness said TikTok’s search suggestions were “highly sexualized” for users who both reported being 13 years old and browsed the app using which “limits exposure to content that may not be comfortable for everyone” including “sexually suggestive content,” according to TikTok’s support page. The report comes amid a broader push both in the United Kingdom and the United States to better protect children online, and as TikTok faces allegations in that it’s harmful to young users’ mental health. When CNN reached out about the report, a TikTok spokesperson said the company was committed to keeping their users’ experience safe. “As soon as we were made aware of these claims, we took immediate action to investigate them, remove content that violated our policies, and launch improvements to our search suggestion feature,” the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that TikTok has “more than 50 features and settings designed specifically to support the safety and well-being of teens.” The statement also said TikTok is “fully committed to providing safe and age-appropriate experiences” and that it removes “9 in 10 violative videos before they are ever viewed.” Sexualized searches, however, were recommended “the very first time that the user clicked into the search bar” for three of the test accounts Global Witness created, according to the report. TikTok surfaced pornographic content to all seven test users “just a small number of clicks after setting up the account.” “Our point isn’t just that TikTok shows pornographic content to minors. It is that TikTok’s search algorithms actively push minors towards pornographic content,” said Global Witness in its report. TikTok’s prohibit content containing nudity, sexual activity, and sexual services as well as any content containing sexually suggestive acts and significant body exposure involving youth. TikTok said in its covering January through March 2025 that roughly 30% of the content removed from the platform because of a policy violation was taken down due to sensitive and mature themes. TikTok removes around 6 million underage accounts globally every month by using various age detection methods, including technology to detect when an account may be used by a child under the age of 13, according to a spokesperson. It also trains moderation teams to spot signals that kids under 13 may be using TikTok.

TikTok did not immediately respond to Stephens’ comment when asked by CNN. is a set of laws that ﻿is meant to crack down on internet safety by enforcing new rules that require tech companies to regulate certain types of content, such as implementing age checks to prevent children from accessing content deemed harmful such as pornography and posts related to self-harm. The act also applies to online platforms outside of the UK that have a large UK user base or are capable of being accessed by UK users. But critics of the act, such as the , have said the age verification rules could threaten privacy of all ages. Global Witness said it conducted the first few tests before the UK’s Online Safety Act child safety rules and ran additional tests after that date.

{"content": "Mario Guevara, the Salvadoran journalist who gained popularity by documenting immigration raids, has been deported after spending months in federal custody. Guevara was deported to his native El Salvador early Friday morning, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) confirmed to CNN, more than three months after the Spanish-language live-streamer was while covering an Atlanta-area “No Kings” protest. He was transferred to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention shortly after his arrest. Moments after arriving at San Salvador’s airport on Friday, he was released by Salvadoran immigration authorities and is no longer expected to be taken to immigration facilities in the capital. Speaking to reporters in El Salvador, Guevara said he felt “strong” and described his situation as bittersweet. “I feel sad, but I also feel happy to be in my homeland. I mean, they didn’t execute me. Perhaps the racist government wanted to execute me. And I’m here in my homeland. So, at the end of the day, I think it’s a blessing,” he said. Despite saying he was treated like a criminal by the US government, he insists he holds no resentment. “At the end of the day, they’re just following orders,” he said. Guevara’s deportation comes after the Bureau of Immigration Appeals on September 19, ordering that he be removed from the US. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represents Guevara, on Monday, but the court earlier this week. “Journalists should not have to fear government retaliation, including prolonged detention, for reporting on government activity, and showing up to work should not result in your family being torn apart,” Scarlet Kim, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, & Technology Project, . “Mario’s treatment should terrify any person in this country that cares about a free press.” For months, groups including CPJ and ACLU criticized Guevara’s detention, which continued even after a Georgia immigration judge on bond in early July. and called for Guevara’s release from ICE detention. Although prosecutors dropped criminal charges stemming from Guevara’s arrest, determining that he had complied with law enforcement, the government argued that Guevara ought to be kept in detention, alleging his live-streaming of law enforcement activities presented a risk to their work. “The only thing that journalists like Guevara threaten is the government’s chokehold on information it doesn’t want the public to know,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said . Instead of releasing Guevara, the Board of Immigration Appeals reopened Guevara’s 13-year-old immigration case, which had been closed and authorized him to work in the US. The board claimed immigration courts cannot approve Guevara’s release, given his removal had previously been ordered in 2012. Less than a week after his release was ordered in July, ICE was by an immigration appeals court, effectively blocking Guevara’s bond, allowing for his continued detention. During his time in custody, Guevara was the only known journalist detained by the US government. “The Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States says ‘with liberty and justice for all,’” Guevara wrote in published by the ACLU. “Right now, that is a fallacy. They should add, ‘except for immigrants.’” In , Guevara’s son, Oscar, wrote that the journalist “has not always been safe” throughout his detention. “Known for his journalism, even by others inside, he has had inmates take photos of him and threaten to hurt him should my family not pay $60 a day,” he wrote. “What else could we do? We paid.” “Words cannot begin to describe the loss and devastation my family feels,” Oscar Guevera the day before Mario’s deportation. “I am in utter shock and disbelief the government has punished my father for simply doing his life’s work of journalism.” Guevara first entered the US in 2004 on a tourist visa and applied for asylum in 2005. He had fled his native El Salvador over his reporting there. Reporters Without Borders, which tracks the treatment of journalists globally, that “journalists regularly face threats and the seizure of their equipment” in El Salvador.

{"content": "Slower mortgage approvals, stalled rural home loans and a freeze on new flood insurance policies: The government shutdown, which began at midnight on October 1, could gum up some of the gears that keep the US housing market running. It is unclear how long will remain in effect. Experts say most housing programs will continue amid the closure, and most people may not be impacted yet. But with home sales already stalled by high prices, the government’s first shutdown in nearly seven years threatens to slow parts of the housing market even further. “Anything that you need to reach the government for, if someone is not in the office or someone is on furlough, that loan may have an issue,” said Justin Demola, the president of Lenders One, a national alliance of mortgage bankers. At the height of in the US, the National Flood Insurance Program isn’t able to write new policies during the shutdown, said Daniel Schwarcz, a professor of insurance law at the University of Minnesota. The program, backed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), offers federally backed flood insurance to homeowners. “If you already have an insurance policy, it’s still in effect,” Schwarcz said. “The shutdown affects the ability of the NFIP to actually renew an insurance policy or issue a new policy, but it doesn’t undermine the validity or enforceability of an insurance policy that’s already been issued.” That means homeowners whose policies are up for renewal may see their coverage lapse. They will have to renew those policies when the government reopens, but it could result in a coverage gap until then, Schwarcz said. Demola said most mortgage lenders won’t allow a home purchase in a high-risk flood zone to proceed until a homebuyer obtains . But all-cash buyers – even those in high-risk flood areas – aren’t required to get flood insurance and can proceed with their home purchases, even during the shutdown. Some homebuyers may be able to obtain flood insurance on the private market, but people who are not covered by private insurers will have to wait for the government to reopen before they can finalize their home purchase. In a statement on Wednesday, Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee warned that curtailing the NFIP “could threaten over 1,300 home sale closings each day, potentially locking thousands of families out of the dream of homeownership or putting them at risk if their home sales proceed without coverage.” “The longer this (shutdown) continues, the longer it will affect the housing market,” Schwarcz said. “Once you start accumulating the days where these closings don’t happen or these houses remain on the market, that can start having effects… It can cause closings to fall through.” Homebuyers in rural areas of the United States may be particularly affected. Housing loans issued by the US Department of Agriculture to help low- and moderate-income borrowers purchase homes in rural areas will not be issued during the shutdown, according to the agency’s contingency plans. Still, most people buying a home may not feel the effects of a shutdown unless it persists for an extended period, Demola said. When taking out a mortgage, lenders will still be able to verify your Social Security number and income, he added. However, with the Internal Revenue Service impacted, some mortgage approvals could face major delays, to the National Association of Homebuilders. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that help provide stability and affordability to America’s home mortgage market, will continue to operate, as they are technically independent companies run separately from the US government. That means most Americans who take out loans backed by the two entities can proceed with their home purchase – as long as their property doesn’t require a flood insurance policy. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development, which administers federal funding for various housing services, said most of its activities supporting government-backed mortgages will continue during a lapse in funding, as well. Nicole Upano, a representative from the National Apartment Association, said the agency is continuing to make payments for Section 8 contracts, which provide rental assistance to low-income families, the elderly and people with disabilities. “There should not be any immediate disruption for any residents who benefit from Section 8 housing choice vouchers,” Upano said.

Looking forward to sharing more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over.” The draft images show Trump’s side profile on the front with “Liberty” at the top, “In God we Trust” on the bottom and the dates 1776 and 2026. On the reverse is the famous image of Trump raising his fist after the Bulter, Pennsylvania, assassination attempt, with the words “FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT” at the top and an American flag billowing behind his head. It’s not clear the controversial coin design will be minted: It’s against US law to display the image of a sitting president or living former president. A president may be featured on a coin . “No coin issued under this subsection may bear the image of a living former or current President, or of any deceased former President during the 2-year period following the date of the death of that President,” according to the US code governing coin design. In anticipation of America’s 250th anniversary, Congress passed the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act, which allows the US Treasury to mint special $1 coins to celebrate the event. The act states that the Treasury secretary may “mint for issuance during the one-year period beginning January 1, 2026, $1 dollar coins with designs emblematic of the United States semiquincentennial.” That also states, “No head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person, living or dead, and no portrait of a living person may be included in the design on the reverse of specified coins.” The side portrait of Trump is featured on the front side of the coin, not the reverse, appearing to get around the law. The reverse still features Trump, but it’s unclear if the image would be a violation of the law. The reverse side still features Trump, but the Butler image falls outside of the direct language “head and shoulders portrait or bust.” “No head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person, living or dead, and no portrait of a living person may be included in the design on the reverse of specified coins,” the text states. While the Treasury confirms that the drafts with Trump’s portrait on either side are legitimate, a spokesperson emphasized that a final design has not been chosen. “While a final $1 dollar coin design has not yet been selected to commemorate the United States’ semiquincentennial, this first draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles,” a Treasury spokesperson told CNN, adding that they “look forward to sharing more soon.” Earlier in a press briefing, White House press secretary was asked if Trump has seen the first draft images of the coin with his face on it. “I’m not sure if he’s seen it, but I’m sure he’ll love it,” Leavitt said.

{"content": "France lost its fifth prime minister in less than two years this week, just before the 2026 budget was due to be sent to parliament. Monday after announcing a cabinet that largely retained the same ministers as under his unpopular predecessor, triggering a backlash. François Bayrou last month after trying to push through a savings plan that included scrapping two public holidays and freezing public spending Lecornu’s resignation raised doubts over whether the 2026 budget – including much-needed debt-cutting reforms – can be passed in time. But after talking to lawmakers from a number of parties, he provided some reassurance Wednesday, acting in a caretaker capacity. “There is a willingness for France to have a budget before December 31,” he said. France is Europe’s relative to its economic output. Its is behind only those of Greece and Italy, which were at the heart of the in 2011. When measured by – the gap between government spending and revenue – France is also among the most spendthrift in the European Union, according to Eurostat, the bloc’s statistics office. Although the country has a long history of hefty overspending, since June last year bond investors have become more worried about its finances, resulting in higher borrowing costs for the already cash-strapped government. Here’s what’s behind the recent political and market turmoil over France’s debt. By far the on the French public purse comes from what is known as , which covers pension payments, unemployment benefits and other outlays. The country’s spending on social protection – at 23.3% of gross domestic product – is the second-highest in the EU, behind only Finland’s, according to Eurostat. This type of spending in France is also liberal by global standards. Based on from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which uses different methodology from Eurostat, the country allocated the equivalent of 30.6% of its GDP to social protection last year, far above the 19.8% spent by the United States, for example. State pensions make up a of France’s social expenditure. They are generous by developed country standards and available from an earlier age than in many other rich economies. Beyond the more traditional spending on pensions and health care, the government also funds some unusual benefits. For example, it provides to families employing a childcare worker or a nanny for children under six, according to Business France, a national agency that helps foreign companies set up in the country. “We do reimburse a lot of things that we basically can no longer afford to reimburse,” Alexandra Roulet, an economics professor at business school INSEAD and a former economic adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron, told CNN. The authorities’ response to two back-to-back crises in recent years has also contributed to the country’s debt load. The government from the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic and the spike in energy prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. France’s politicians are deeply divided on whether the solution is to rein in spending or raise taxes, particularly as taxes are already high. The country’s revenue from in 2023 – the highest percentage in the EU. Agreeing on a deficit-reducing budget has also been difficult against the backdrop of against austerity measures. Take the government’s attempt earlier this year to reduce its generous health care spending: Its proposal to cut the amount the state compensates taxi drivers for transporting certain patients to and from doctor’s appointments was met with . A move by the government in 2023 to force through pension reforms that will push up the retirement age from 62 to 64 also triggered , though they still came into law. Since Macron came to power in 2017, public anger has been amplified by tax cuts for businesses and the removal of implemented early on in his presidency. Combined with his plans for an eco-friendly , those measures fueled a view of him as the – an image he has struggled to shake off. France’s debt burden is among the highest in the developed world: It stood at 116.5% of its GDP in 2023, compared with 122.9% in the US, according to the OECD. Based on benchmark 10-year government bonds, investors now consider the EU’s second-largest economy a riskier borrower than Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain – which were all at the center of Europe’s 2011 debt crisis. The main reason for this market uproar lies in France’s inability to move forward with repairs to public finances. The stall in policymaking can be traced back to June 2024, when Macron dissolved parliament and , a gamble that saw his party lose seats and splintered the National Assembly “Ever since Macron dissolved parliament, resulting in political paralysis, France has been the weak link in the eurozone,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the Berenberg bank, told CNN, referring to the group of 20 countries that use the euro. The recent rise in France’s borrowing costs compared with those of Italy is particularly striking. Italy, the EU’s third-largest economy, and . However, Italy is governed by a coalition that enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority and which has taken steps to reduce the country’s budget deficit. “If you look at its political situation now… it does actually look pretty stable,” Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at consultancy Capital Economics, told CNN. “So that’s why – even before the recent resignation of yet another prime minister – France has become more of a focus of concern than Italy.” So far, analysts do not expect another European debt crisis, this time centering on France. But French borrowing costs could jump if candidates from the extreme right or extreme left win the next presidential election, currently due in 2027, Kenningham said. “If (Marine) Le Pen comes in or let alone (Jean-Luc) Melenchon from the left-wing party… and if they were to actually implement even half of what they’ve said they want to do, then sure, you could get a sort of freak-out moment in the bond markets,” he said.

{"content": "The Federal Reserve stepped in last month to safeguard America’s labor market, cutting rates by a quarter point to shore up a slowdown in hiring. But it has another equally important problem still to address — one that has driven up the cost of living in the United States and continues to strain lower- and middle-income households. Inflation — the other side of the Fed’s dual mandate — still hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels and President Donald Trump’s trade war The Fed came within a hair of its 2% target by the end of last year, but then Trump’s aggressive policies shifted the tectonic plates of the economy. It’s a thorny issue that has divided policymakers on the rate-setting committee: The central bankers who called for rate cuts beginning in July — all Trump appointees — say they’re hopeful that tariff inflation will be temporary. Other Fed officials, however, aren’t convinced. “We have been missing our mandate on the inflation side, our objective of 2%, for more than four and a half years,” Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack told CNBC on September 29. “I continue to be worried about where we are from an inflation perspective.” The central bank has held interest rates steady for nine months straight in order to gauge the impact of Trump’s tariffs on the economy. But with the labor market now also under some duress, the economic picture has become far more complex. “There are no risk-free paths now,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters at a September press conference. “It’s not incredibly obvious what to do.” “We have to keep our eye on inflation. At the same time, we cannot ignore and must keep our eye on maximum employment. Those are our two equal goals,” he added. The Fed received broad criticism for being too late to respond to inflation’s eruption in 2021 — a view that some Fed officials, including Powell, have acknowledged. But by mid-2022, Fed officials were correcting course, hiking rates at the fastest pace since the 1980s. And it worked. By the end of last year, the Fed was on track to pull off the elusive “soft landing” by taming inflation without a recession. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, continued to slow in the first half of 2025, reaching a four-year low of 2.3% in April. Then, in January, Trump began his second term. His erratic trade war has paralyzed businesses, putting hiring plans on hold. It’s also roiled price pressures in the economy. That’s on top of other massive policy shifts, such as mass deportations and cuts to federal funding. “The economy is in a tug of war,” Philip Straehl, chief investment officer, Americas, at Morningstar Wealth, told CNN. “The Fed is making a tradeoff for the labor market because the tariff uncertainty is weighing on companies, you see what’s happening with federal workers and the impact of AI on certain industries,” he said. The Fed is expected to lower borrowing costs two more times by the end of the year, according to Fed officials’ latest economic projections, in the hopes that this will help prevent unemployment from surging. Reduced interest rates could also help the many Americans still struggling with the higher cost of living. Job growth since the summer ; unemployment among young people and minorities has climbed sharply; and there are now than there are job openings, according to the latest Labor Department data. Unemployment remains relatively low, at 4.3%, but research shows that whenever joblessness rises, it typically continues to do so — unless the Fed steps in. To put that into context, a 0.1% change in the unemployment rate equals hundreds of thousands of people. To make matters more complicated, the government’s shutdown means the suspension of official economic data that provides critical guidance for policymakers on issues like employment, inflation and trade. The September jobs report, due out October 3, has already been delayed and key inflation data due out next week could also be postponed. That puts a blindfold on the Fed. For now, officials are still widely expected to lower rates by a quarter point at their October 28-29 policy meeting, according to futures. Meanwhile, Americans are stuck waiting for the economy to right itself after years of high inflation. In August, price hikes were up by about 20% compared to January 2021, according to the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. That has resulted in many low-income households cutting back, or trading down for cheaper alternatives, according to retailers. Credit scores are also with the return of student debt payments. And the US economy is starting to bifurcate: Executives at major companies such as Walmart, McDonald’s and Target regularly detail in earnings calls the ongoing economic plight of low- and middle-income Americans. The University of Michigan’s noted that “sentiment for consumers with larger stock holdings held steady in September, while for those with smaller or no holdings, sentiment decreased.” “There is this big dichotomy between higher-income and lower-income consumers which continues and is a real issue,” Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf told CNBC on September 10. “The low end is spending the money that they have, so their balances are below … pre-pandemic levels; they are living on the edge,” he said. Americans are also still facing a housing crisis of low supply, high prices and elevated mortgage rates. Trump has said the Fed needs to lower interest rates in order to bring about better affordability for home seekers and has tried to influence the politically independent Fed in order to extract reduced borrowing costs. Trump said he would fire Powell (and then said he would not), has ousted Fed Governor Lisa Cook (although she launched an immediate legal challenge and ) and has pressured members of the Board to resign. He even had his top economic adviser take a leave of absence in order to on the Fed’s powerful governing Board. Trump has also said he intends to this year, months before Powell’s term ends in May, an unusual step that effectively introduces a “shadow” leader at the central bank, diluting Powell’s power as consensus builder. At least two voting members of the rate-setting committee are under contention for the role, and have spoken out in favor of aggressive rate cuts. That all leaves the central bank facing a battle on multiple fronts: Protecting its independence while preventing both inflation and unemployment from surging in the year ahead amid continued economic uncertainty (and a data blackout). “There is not a generic playbook for how the central bank should respond to a stagflationary shock,” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said at an event in New York in April.", "tags": ["inflation", "high", "fed"]},
{"content": "Unless you already have dual citizenship or own a home in another country, retiring abroad may not be quite as easy as all the beautiful photos and home-and-travel shows make it seem. Whether you’re motivated to live in another country for cost-of-living, quality-of-life or political reasons, there are many practical financial issues to consider before making the move. “You need to do your due diligence,” said New Jersey-based certified financial planner Leo Chubinishvili at Access Wealth. Whichever country you’re interested in, live there for a month or two before making any big moves. The last thing you want is to go through a lengthy legal and administrative process only to realize you don’t actually like living in the place you chose. Or you don’t feel welcome as a new immigrant. “I personally recommend staying in an Airbnb for a month where you have to fend for yourself as a local to see if that is something you’re happy doing,” said Adalberto Pucca, who is head of global mobility services at Global Citizen Solutions, which helps people in more than 40 countries make the move to another nation. Once you find a country you like, it might take anywhere from six months to two years to finalize the essential financial, legal and administrative matters. That time will be spent doing research, consulting tax and other professionals, securing a visa, finding housing, setting up your finances and making sure you have the requisite type of health coverage once abroad. It also accounts for any delays in processing that you might encounter. A key organizing principle during that preparation time will be the type of visa you’re seeking and whether your end goal is to get temporary or permanent residency status or seek citizenship. There are typically two visa types that might be a fit for US retirees, depending on your circumstances, Pucca noted. In many countries, the first type is a retiree visa, or a passive income visa, for which you will need to prove that your assets (savings and investments) can throw off at least the minimum required income to support yourself. That minimum is set by the host country. Note, however, if you’re also planning to derive some income from working remotely for a US company, find out if earning active income from abroad is permitted under the rules of the visa you’re applying for, Pucca said. (Here is GCS’ , which compiles different countries’ minimum income and other eligibility requirements. The organization also breaks out a list of the in terms of “balancing affordability, healthcare access, lifestyle perks, and ease of integration.”) The second category is a so-called golden visa, which offers you residency or even citizenship in some places in exchange for a minimum required investment — whether by buying real estate in the country where you want to move, investing in other assets or entities in the country or even making a large deposit in a national bank. The terms for golden visas are usually more flexible than a retiree visa — for instance, they typically have very low- to no-minimum-stay rules, Pucca said. Such minimum investment requirements might range from $250,000 to $1 million or more. (Here is the latest GCS list on the offering a golden visa.) Even if you have paid in to Medicare your entire career, it will not subsidize your care in another country. So, find out what is required to be eligible for care through the national health care system of the country you choose, or whether you need to purchase private international health insurance. If, like many expats, you plan to come back to the United States frequently — or even move back at some point — you’re likely to get some of your medical care in the United States. That’s why Chubinishvili recommends, if possible, keeping up your monthly payments , which subsidizes costs for non-hospital care — such as doctor visits, preventative care, tests, home health services and medical equipment. Keep in mind, too, if you don’t sign up for Medicare when you’re first eligible, the Social Security Administration, which processes your application for the program, that “if you do so at a later date, you will pay a 10% higher premium for each 12-month period you could have been enrolled but were not.” Lastly, research the quality of medical care in your chosen destination because if it’s below par, you should budget for money to pay for the care you’ll seek in the United States. You can receive Social Security benefits while abroad, depending where you live. In 2024, the agency reported that nearly 712,000 people were receiving Social Security benefits abroad, of which more than 463,000 were retired workers. The Social Security Administration offers about what is involved, and offers a to let you know if the agency is allowed to send benefits directly to the country where you’ll be living. While you may decide to open a bank account and brokerage account in the country where you move, Chubinishvili recommends his clients also keep their US-based bank and brokerage accounts as well as their 401(k)s, IRAs and Roth IRAs. But, well before you leave, find out from each institution housing your accounts what their rules and requirements are for customers who move abroad. Ask about everything from the consequences of changing your address to rules governing whether and how you can make transactions from abroad. Or, if you have a financial adviser, how that person may do so in your stead. Also see what services they offer to transfer money from your US-based accounts to ones you open up abroad, and what, if any, costs are associated with them. Both Pucca and Chubinishvili recommend having two certified public accountants who can work together on your behalf: one based in the United States and one based in the country where you’re going. Why? Because it is complicated to figure out the intersection of US tax laws and those of other countries — and whether the country you’re going to has a tax treaty with the United States. Having professional advice about each tax system can help you avoid inadvertently being double taxed on some types of income, savings or investments. Plus, a CPA will keep you up to speed on your tax reporting requirements since you may be required to fill out two returns — one to the IRS and one to the tax authority in the country where you relocate. And the CPA will make sure, if necessary, that you fill out a for the IRS. It’s a listing of your foreign financial accounts (eg, banks, brokerages and mutual funds). And failure to file or filing late can bring big penalties.", "tags": ["financial", "mind", "considerations", "top"]},

At least one of the eight people indicted in the case is accused of illegally performing an abortion in addition to charges of practicing without a license, court documents show. In March, Paxton brought felony charges against Houston-area midwife Maria Margarita Rojas, 49, who he says provided illegal abortions and operated multiple medical clinics without a license. Rojas was the first person charged in violation of the , according to Paxton’s office. “We’re still working vigorously to defend Ms. Rojas because we believe she did not commit any crimes,” Rojas’ attorney, Nicole DeBorde Hochglaube, told CNN on Wednesday. “We have yet to receive any evidence that supports either of those claims.” Hochglaube said Paxton, who referred to the defendants as a “cabal of abortion-loving radicals,” has made public statements about Rojas and the investigation designed to inflame the public and “run afoul of Texas disciplinary rules of professional conduct.” The Center for Reproductive Rights called the case against Rojas a sham. The organization is representing Rojas in a separate civil lawsuit. “Without any proof, Paxton went after Rojas, a licensed midwife dedicated to helping her pregnant patients. He heartlessly shut down several clinics that provided lawful, affordable services to families around Houston, most of whom were low-income, uninsured immigrants with few options for health care,” Jenna Hudson, the group’s senior counsel, told CNN in a statement. Supporting documents were not readily available for all eight individuals named Wednesday, though some appeared on a court docket. CNN reached out to Paxton’s office and the Waller County district attorney for additional information. Paxton emphasized in his announcement that some of the eight individuals include foreign nationals. “It’s no coincidence that he is targeting Rojas and these clinics amid the widespread anti-immigrant sentiment nationwide. Texas health care workers deserve respect, not to be treated like criminals,” Hudson said. Following her arrest in March, Rojas was booked into the Waller County Sheriff’s Office and released the next day, according to jail records. The midwife was indicted on 15 felony counts in Waller County, including illegal performance of an abortion and 12 counts of practicing medicine without a license, Paxton’s office said. Her network of clinics was barred from practicing medicine as the case unfolds, it added. , which makes no exceptions for rape or incest, allows for abortions only if a pregnant person is “at risk of death or serious physical impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed or induced.” Providers – who risk penalties of at least $100,000, the loss of their medical licenses and prison time for violating the law – have said the uncertainty around that policy has had a chilling effect on medically necessary abortions in the state. While state law does not allow for patients seeking abortions to be criminally prosecuted themselves, a 26-year-old Texas woman was arrested and charged with murder in 2022 after using medication to self-induce her own abortion.

{"content": "Beijing ramped up sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports on Thursday, expanding the list of minerals under control and extending curbs to target their production technologies and their overseas use, including for military and semiconductor applications. China dominates the global processing of rare earths – essential in everything from everyday electronics to fighter jets. The latest move came as Beijing broadened its leverage in trade talks with the United States and ahead of an expected meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea later this month. Under the new rules, Beijing further asserts its dominance in the sector by adding five rare-earth elements, including holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium, and related magnets and materials, to its existing control list, requiring export licenses. The announcement on Thursday brought the total number of restricted elements to 12, out of the 17 types of rare earths. Licenses for the export of technologies used in rare earth mining, smelting and processing, as well as for magnets manufacturing. Foreign firms seeking to supply rare earths produced in China or processed with Chinese technologies will also need to obtain a license, according to . The restrictions aim to “safeguard national security and interests” by preventing the materials from “being used, directly or indirectly, in military and other sensitive fields,” the ministry said. The commerce ministry will reject license applications for military use as well as defense companies and associated entities “in principle,” it said. Export license applications involving the use of rare earths in the developing and making of advanced computing and memory chips, as well as artificial intelligence with potential military applications, will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, the ministry said. Moreover, Chinese nationals and companies are prohibited from assisting rare earth mining, processing and magnets manufacturing outside China without government approval. In a move to protect China’s edge in the electric vehicle industry, the ministry on Thursday also announced curbs on lithium batteries and synthetic graphite anode materials, as well as equipment and technologies used to produce them. The restrictions on new rare earth elements, as well as lithium batteries and related materials, will start on November 8. The extraterritorial rules will be effective on December 1. The rest of the restrictions went into effect immediately on Thursday. China-US relations have shown tentative signs of improvement in recent months, though tensions remain. Last week, Washington on certain Chinese tech companies to also cover their subsidiaries, drawing ire from Beijing. In a separate announcement Thursday, the Chinese commerce ministry added 14 military, technology and security groups from the US and other countries to its unreliable entity list, barring them from operating in China, trading with Chinese companies or making new investments in the country. Notably, the ministry added TechInsights, a Canadian technology research firm specializing in semiconductors, to the list. The company is known for revealing that some of Chinese tech giant Huawei’s AI processors — in a possible violation of US export controls, which has been under investigation by American authorities. CNN has reached out to TechInsights for comment. Beijing has long criticized Washington for exercising “long arm jurisdictions” in US export controls, which prevented third-country companies like TSMC from supplying China with chips manufactured with American technology. But China’s move on Thursday signaled a shift in its strategy – adopting similar extraterritorial measures by extending its curbs on rare earths beyond borders. Rare earths emerged as a key source of friction between the world’s two largest economies in April, when Beijing on seven types of rare earth elements and their magnets in response to Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” on Chinese goods. The move swiftly disrupted global supply chains, rattling industries from automobiles to defense. Only in June did China and the US on rare earth shipments, slowly easing the shortages of the critical elements, though some industries are still grappling with the fallout. In a , a commerce ministry spokesperson said the authorities have found that some foreign organizations and individuals had transferred or supplied Chinese rare earth items or technologies, with some materials being used in military or other sensitive fields. “These actions have caused significant harm or potential threats to China’s national security and interests, undermined international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts,” the spokesperson said.

{"content": "The last of 10 prisoners who escaped nearly five months ago from a New Orleans jail has been captured at a home in Atlanta, according to the US Marshals. , who had been on the run since May 16 after breaking out of the Orleans Justice Center with nine other inmates, was captured Wednesday in Southwest Atlanta after a standoff with Atlanta Police and US Marshals, Deputy US Marshal Brian Fair said. A tip called in to Crimestoppers Greater New Orleans, along with follow-up investigative work, ultimately led to Groves’ arrest in Atlanta, Fair said. “It took almost three hours to locate him in the house. Gas had to be deployed into the house multiple times by (the) Atlanta Police Department’s SWAT team, and he was ultimately located hiding in a crawl space,” Fair told CNN. Groves waived his right to an extradition hearing Thursday morning in front of a judge in Fulton County, Georgia, saying he wanted to return to where he was from. His capture marks the end of a key chapter in a brazen, nighttime jailbreak that grabbed the nation’s attention and put people close to the convicts’ cases – from victims’ relatives to prosecutors – on edge for their own safety. Groves’ escape “represented a serious breach of public safety and a historic failure of custodial security,” New Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams said Wednesday. Groves, 28, was convicted of murdering two men on Mardi Gras in 2018 and was awaiting sentencing when he escaped in May, said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill at a Wednesday news conference. He was one of the gunmen who opened fire with AK-47-style assault rifles “on what should have been a joyous Mardi Gras family gathering,” said at the time. Groves was found guilty of two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted second-degree murder, charges that carry a life sentence, the district attorney said. “This was a very dangerous individual. He is going to face jail time for a very, very long time” for his previous charges as well as additional time resulting from his escape, Murrill said. Groves will be taken to the infamous Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, where the other nine former escaped inmates are being held, said Murrill. Authorities are looking into upgrading the charges against Groves to aggravated escape “in light of the material” found on him, including weapons and drugs, Murrill said. Federal, state and local law enforcement “worked together seamlessly to locate and arrest those fugitives,” said Col. Robert Hodges, superintendent of the Louisiana State Police. In early October, officers assigned to the task force investigating the escape learned Groves was likely in the Atlanta area and through information “gathered via multiple search warrants and other investigative means,” detectives gathered digital evidence that Groves was at a home, Hodges said. Several law enforcement agencies, including the Atlanta Police Department and the US Marshals Service, assisted in executing the search warrant at the home that led to Groves’ arrest, said Hodges. “His capture brings long-awaited calm to victims, their families, the witnesses who testified, the assistant district attorneys who prosecuted him and the people of New Orleans who were rightly concerned that a convicted violent offender had escaped so easily and evaded justice for so long,” Williams said shortly after Groves was apprehended. “We will pursue every available legal avenue to ensure that Derrick Groves answers for every crime he has committed and every consequence he has sought to avoid,” he said. Just after midnight on May 16, a corrections monitoring technician in New Orleans stepped away to get food. At the time, the Orleans Justice Center had been in lockdown since 10:30 p.m., as usual, with inmates expected to be in their cells for the night. But in the technician’s absence, several inmates began tampering with the door of Cell Delta 1006. They pulled until it broke open and slipped into the handicap cell, where they used electric hair trimmers with clipper blades to help cut through the cell walls behind a toilet, a source with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN. They are believed to have placed the toilet back on the wall after the jailbreak to conceal the hole, according to the source. Before all 10 inmates fled the New Orleans jail and crossed the Louisiana interstate into the warm, muggy night, they left a message on a wall on their way out. “To Easy LoL,” it read. The US Marshals credit Wednesday’s apprehension of Groves in Atlanta to a multi-agency law enforcement collaboration between the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, the New Orleans Police Department, the Louisiana State Police, Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI New Orleans. “We’re just very pleased this one is over,” Fair told CNN.", "tags": ["escapees", "police", "atlanta", "orleans", "months", "standoff"]},
{"content": "A Texas court has again granted a stay of execution to , who has long claimed he is innocent in the murder of his 2-year-old daughter Nikki Curtis, saying his conviction based on a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome was flawed. The ruling Thursday by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals halts Roberson’s execution scheduled to take place October 16, which his attorneys have said would be the first in the US based on an allegation of shaken baby syndrome. The appeals court sent Roberson’s case back to his trial court for further review after years of unsuccessful appeals by the inmate and his attorneys. Ahead of his last execution date last October, state and federal courts, including the US Supreme Court, declined to stop his execution, and the Texas parole board rejected his plea for clemency. In a death row interview with CNN Wednesday, Roberson again said he was innocent, but that he was at peace thanks to his faith. “I’m not scared to die, but I’m not ready to die yet, you know,” he said. “No matter what happens, I’m going home to a free world,” Roberson said. “I’m going home to be with the Lord.” Texas prison officials say the unit warden delivered the news to Roberson shortly after the court ruled to halt the upcoming execution. The order Thursday says the court found Roberson satisfied his claim that he should get relief under the state’s , which allows people to challenge their convictions if there is new scientific evidence. In sending the case back to Roberson’s trial court for review, the appeals court cited a ruling it delivered last year, when it granted a new trial to a man, Andrew Roark, who was convicted of injury to a child based on a similar allegation of shaken baby syndrome. In that case, the court found scientific evidence had evolved and that it was “more likely than not” Roark, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison, would not have been convicted. There remains among pediatricians that the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome – now considered a subset of abusive head trauma – is legitimate. But Roberson’s supporters argue there are other explanations for Nikki’s death that don’t involve abuse: Shifts in the understanding of the causes of symptoms Nikki displayed shortly before her death, along with mounting new evidence, prove his innocence or at least warrant a new trial, they say. On Thursday, Roberson’s attorney celebrated the ruling, but acknowledged there is still work to be done. “We have won a battle, but we have certainly not won the war,” Gretchen Sween told reporters. “But quite literally, our Robert lives to fight another day, and that really is a triumph.” Brian Wharton joins The Lead Roberson’s execution last year was only stopped following a remarkable maneuver from a group of state lawmakers, who , prompting to issue a temporary stay. In the year since, Roberson and his attorneys had hoped to secure a new trial, but was set even as appeals remained pending. State Rep. Brian Harrison, a Republican who orchestrated the House committee subpoena last year, commended the Texas appeals court judges, stressing his belief that Roberson has “never been given a fair trial.” “It is most incumbent on those of us who support capital punishment to ensure that potentially innocent people are never subject to it,” Harrison . “I will not stop fighting for justice and to ensure my children and the next generation do not inherit a state where the government can deprive Texans of life and liberty absent due process and fair trials.” The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton took over representation of the state in Roberson’s proceedings this summer and has been fighting for the execution to proceed. In last year, his office accused “a coalition of activists and State legislators” of “interfering with the justice system.” “They have attempted to mislead the public by falsely claiming that Roberson was unfairly convicted through ‘junk science’ concerning ‘shaken baby syndrome,’” the statement said. CNN has reached out to the office and that of Gov. Greg Abbott for comment. Roberson’s case dates back to January 2002, when he brought his daughter to a Palestine, Texas, hospital. Doctors determined Nikki to be the victim of abuse and transferred her to a hospital in Dallas, where she was later taken off life support. “That changed my life forever, you know, when I lost her,” Roberson told CNN Wednesday. “And I don’t wish that even on my worst enemy.” Roberson told investigators he and Nikki had fallen asleep the night before in the same bed. He said he woke overnight to a cry from Nikki and found she had fallen off the bed. Roberson kept her awake a while longer, he said, before they fell back asleep. When he woke later that morning, she was unresponsive. Roberson’s supporters say Nikki, a sickly child who visited the doctor’s office or emergency room dozens of times in her short life, had undiagnosed pneumonia. Other complications – including prescribed medicine they say further suppressed Nikki’s breathing – caused the symptoms doctors used to diagnose abuse, Roberson’s attorneys say. Shaken baby syndrome is now considered a type of , a broader term that emerged around 2009 to reflect it can be caused by actions other than shaking, like impacts to a child’s head. It is a leading cause of child abuse deaths for children under 5, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roberson’s attorneys and medical experts they cite say the evidence shows he did not shake his child, nor beat her, .  On Thursday, Sween called those allegations “grotesque falsehoods,” pointing in part to CT scans discovered only in 2018 that she says show Nikki had just one bump on the back of her head. Suspicion of Roberson was fueled further, his attorneys say, because of his undiagnosed autism. Medical staff at the hospital and police misjudged his demeanor as uncaring and evidence of guilt, his attorneys say, arguing his behavior is explained by his 2018 autism diagnosis. “I always in my life, I knew I was different, but I never was diagnosed,” Roberson said. Former Palestine, Texas, detective Brian Wharton has told CNN the guidance of doctors and Roberson’s demeanor led investigators to focus on the abuse allegations without considering other possibilities. There is no timeline for Roberson’s trial court to review his case, Sween told reporters in a virtual news conference Thursday. But she is “determined to push this as fast as possible.” “Robert has been waiting for 23 years already,” she said, noting she has already reached out to the attorney general’s office in hopes of scheduling a hearing. Thursday’s ruling was celebrated by Roberson’s supporters, who in recent weeks reprised last year’s campaign to save his life. His supporters include Wharton, parents wrongfully convicted of child abuse, medical and forensic experts, advocates for the autism community and the Texas lawmakers who stopped his execution last year – staunch, pro-death penalty conservatives among them. Republican Rep. Lacey Hull, a supporter of the death penalty, said Wednesday if he was executed, “justice will not be served at all.” “It would be a stain on this state, a stain on this nation,” she said at a news conference. On Wednesday, Roberson thought back to last year, when he was pacing back and forth in a cell, moments from being put to death. “I asked the Lord in to intervene. ‘Please have mercy and grace on me and … please help me,’” he said. He had already packed his belongings on death row in Livingston, Texas, and made the hour-long journey to Huntsville, where the execution chamber sits. He’d had his last meal, pasta with meat sauce. Last year’s stay, he said, was a “miracle,” he told CNN. Still, “I was hoping to be home by now,” he said.

{"content": "In an extraordinary effort to inject politics into millions of Americans’ travel experiences, the Trump administration plans to roll out a video at airports across the United States that will blame Democrats for lapses in Transportation Security Administration workers’ pay because of the government shutdown. People waiting in airport security lines will now be met with a new video of the Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem addressing the shutdown. “It is TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,” she says. “However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.” The video was first obtained by Fox News. The Department of Homeland Security responded to CNN’s questions about the video in a statement that noted the “public service video is rolling out across the country,” then repeated the language in the video almost verbatim. “We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel, and our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government,” the video concludes.

{"content": "A judge in Illinois has temporarily blocked federal agents from using certain types of force and crowd-control measures against protesters, after video of a pastor being by pepper balls during a demonstration outside at an ICE facility near Chicago drew widespread outcry. A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order Thursday in the lawsuit filed Monday by the Chicago Headline Club, a nonprofit that represents journalists, alongside unions and individual protesters over federal law enforcement tactics. The lawsuit alleges federal agents have shot, gassed, and detained individuals who have been protesting outside the ICE Detention Facility in Broadview for the , preventing them from “exercising their First Amendment rights.” The suit also claims the tactics infringed journalists’ right to cover the protests. Numerous videos have emerged of agents , pepper balls and roughly throwing protesters to the ground during the demonstrations. The judge’s order, which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from firing various types of less-lethal projectiles and chemical irritants and from “using force, such as pulling or shoving a person to the ground, tackling, or body slamming an individual.” Federal agents are more broadly prohibited from ordering a crowd to disperse or “requiring any person to leave a public place that they lawfully have a right to be.” There are exceptions for individuals who pose a threat to law enforcement or others. The 14-day order took effect Thursday and applies to all DHS agents, including those with ICE and US Customs and Border Protection, in the district which encompasses Chicago and the Broadview ICE processing facility. The judge also laid out specific protections for journalists covering the protests, blocking federal agents from arresting members of the press unless there is “probable cause to believe that the individual has committed a crime.” A preliminary injunction hearing has been set for October 23, according to the federal court docket. The order was issued on the same day that another judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard members in Illinois, one of over President Donald Trump’s push to send troops to Democrat-led cities. The new ruling limiting use of force against protesters was issued in response to a complaint on behalf of multiple plaintiffs, including a Presbyterian pastor who was struck in the head by pepper balls while taking part in demonstrations at the Broadview facility last month. Reverend David Black of Chicago’s First Presbyterian Church “stood in the street offering prayers” and urging ICE officers to repent, when he was repeatedly struck in the face by masked agents standing on top of the ICE facility, according to the lawsuit and video taken during the protest. Black was “visibly attired in clerical garb” when “ICE snipers fired,” the lawsuit said. “Moments later he was doused with chemical spray that ICE agents directed at his face.” Video obtained by CNN shows the pastor near the building with his arms outstretched when a cloud of smoke erupts from an explosion by his head, and he drops to the ground. Other protesters rushed to his aid and surrounded him. Another video shared with CNN shows masked agents pushing Black as he walks back and is then pepper sprayed in the face from close range. In his first television interview since the incident, Black a large group of federal officers then “rushed out of the gate and began to shove us,” describing their behavior was “indiscriminate” and “vicious.” Black said federal officers dispensed “a huge amount of chemical weapons,” adding, “I was drenched from the crown of my head to the socks in my shoes.” The Department of Homeland Security has defended the federal agents’ actions. Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the protestors had blocked an ICE vehicle from leaving the facility, ignored warnings and eventually began “throwing rocks, bottles and launching fireworks” at agents. Black disputed McLaughlin’s claims, calling the account “categorically false.” “There were no ICE vehicles attempting to leave the facility, and I was standing to the side in a gesture of prayer and praying verbally for the ICE officers and those detained inside,” he told Burnett. The pastor insisted he and other protesters received “no warning” and claimed he could hear the agents laughing as they fired shots from the roof, calling it “deeply disturbing.”", "tags": ["shot", "judge", "restrictions", "orders", "protesters", "federal", "tactics", "chicago", "ice", "area"]},
{"content": "As the ninth day of the government shutdown wears on, the focus is on how many air traffic controllers show up to work tonight. The Federal Aviation Administration reported staffing shortages for controllers dealing with airspace in 11 different places Thursday evening, according to a publicly available planning document. The control tower at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport will have fewer than normal controllers from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET along with Bradley International Airport in Connecticut from 4:25 p.m to 8:45 p.m. ET and Roanoke–Blacksburg Regional Airport in Virginia, from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET. Two different parts of the airspace controlled by the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center will be short-staffed from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and two parts of the Albuquerque center will be short staffed between 7:00 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. ET. The Washington center, located in Virginia will not have a normal number of staff from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and the Indianapolis center will be short staffed 12:30 a.m. ET and 6:30 a.m. ET. These areas usually deal with planes flying at higher altitudes. Newark Approach control, which handles flights approaching or departing the airport, will be short staffed from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET. Delays of nearly 90 minutes are expected. And Orlando International Airport Approach will be understaffed from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET. Earlier Thursday, a facility in Fort Worth, Texas was also short-staffed for about an hour. The cause of the staffing problems was not immediately apparent, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said early Thursday on Fox Business a “small fraction” of controllers were “lashing out” because of the government shutdown and not going to work. Every staffing problem reported does not always cause delays since controllers can take other actions, like routing flights to airspace with a normal complement of controllers. Wednesday six FAA facilities had staffing shortages, including the control towers at Denver International and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where about a quarter of the flights were delayed. “It’s a small fraction of people who don’t come to work that can create this massive disruption, and that’s what you’re seeing rippling through our skies today,” Duffy said. He said normally about 5% of delays are caused by short staffing, but now it’s more than half of the delays. “I think what’s happening here, 90% of the controllers, they show up, they come to work, but 10% of them are lashing out,” Duffy said, blaming Democrats in Washington for the shutdown. Monday night, the Hollywood Burbank Airport control tower closed when too many controllers there called out sick. Tuesday, flights in Nashville were delayed and part of the air traffic control operations had to be shifted to another facility across the state when workers took unscheduled time off. If controllers keep not showing up, Duffy will fire them, he said. “If we have a continual small subset of controllers that don’t show up to work… they’re the problem children,” he said. “We need more controllers, but we need the best and the brightest, the dedicated controllers, and if we have some on our staff that aren’t dedicated like we need, we’re going to let them go.” Controllers are considered essential employees and have to work during the government shutdown, despite not being paid. It is against the law for controllers to strike or take actions like sickouts, and the air traffic controllers’ union has urged members to keep working during the shutdown. “There are processes and procedures in place to deal with the inappropriate use of sick leave,” the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said responding to Duffy’s threats. Tuesday is the next payday, and controllers will only get a partial check for hours worked before the shutdown. The government shutdown has not had a “significant impact” on Delta Air Lines’ operations, CEO Ed Bastian told Brad Smith in an interview on “CNN Headline Express.” There were barely any flight cancellations the first week of October, with Delta completing nearly 100% of its flight schedule, Bastian said. Delays were also infrequent, with the airline running on time for 90% of flights. “As everyone’s well aware, the air traffic control system is already understaffed, so I think it’s difficult to speculate at this point in time, ‘is it more understaffed than normal?’” Bastian said. “We’ll keep our customers posted as always, but I do not anticipate any meaningful issues here.” Southwest Airlines, which has a large operation in Nashville, Burbank and several of the other cities hard hit by recent staffing problems, said it is monitoring the situation. Southwest must remain “vigilant in ensuring operational reliability” as air traffic controller staffing is “dynamic and could change rapidly at any ATC facility,” airline leaders wrote Wednesday in a company-wide memo obtained by CNN. “To date, while we’ve experienced a few manageable delays and cancellations related to the shortages,” it said. “We’ll continue to adjust our schedule, as needed and under the direction of the FAA, to help maintain the safety of our customers and employees.” United Airlines and American Airlines declined to comment, directing CNN to the industry group Airlines for America. “When federal employees who manage air traffic, inspect aircraft and secure our nation’s aviation system are furloughed or working without pay, the entire industry and millions of Americans feel the strain,” the group said. “Aviation is the safest mode of transportation, but to maintain that the system may need to slow down.”", "tags": ["miss", "work", "traffic", "transportation", "fire", "air", "secretary", "children", "controllers", "problem"]},
{"content": "The Federal Aviation Administration reported 12 of their facilities were short-staffed on Friday, including some which have caused delays for travelers. Phoenix Sky Harbor International airport will not have the normal number of staff in its control tower from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. ET. Delays there started earlier due to staffing shortages in the facility that operates the surrounding airspace. Two separate parts of the Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center, that manages flights over a large portion of the Southwest, is understaffed until 3 p.m. ET. Chicago Center will not have all of its controllers until 1 a.m. ET, Indianapolis Center will be short staffed from midnight to 6 a.m. ET, and New York Center will be understaffed until 11 p.m. ET. The Central Florida TRACON, where controllers guide planes approaching or departing Orlando International Airport, will be short-staffed from 7 p.m. ET to 11 p.m. ET. Two parts of the Southern California TRACON reported staffing issues until midnight ET and the Chicago TRACON is short-staffed until 1 a.m. ET. Two different FAA operations that deal with traffic at Newark Liberty International Airport reported staffing problems earlier Friday. The control tower and the facility that handles flights approaching or departing the airport did not have their normal amount of workers, which led to delays. Not all staffing problems cause delays, as controllers can sometimes route planes to other airspace with more workers, but there are times slowing flights so a reduced number of staff can manage them is the only way to make everyone is safe. The reasons for the short staffing are not clear, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday a “small fraction” of controllers were “lashing out” because of the government shutdown and not going to work. Air traffic controllers, along with Transportation Security Administration officers, are considered essential employees and have to work during the shutdown, despite not being currently paid. Twelve , including airport towers, approach controls which handle arriving and departing flights as well as centers that handle flights en route. This busy holiday weekend travelers are being warned they could see delays and cancellations from the government shutdown at the airports. “It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,” Airlines for America, the industry trade group, said in a statement. Thursday was the 12th busiest day so far in 2025, and the rest of the weekend is expected to be busy as well. “The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience,” Airlines for America added. The “safety and efficiency” of air travel in the United States depends on unpaid air traffic controllers showing up to work, the FAA administrator said in a memo to employees on Friday morning. “To the entire FAA team, both those continuing operations and those currently furloughed, thank you for your professionalism and resilience,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said in the email. “Your efforts to keep thousands of flights operating safely each day are noticed and deeply appreciated.” On Thursday Duffy noted more than half of air traffic delays are now being caused by staffing shortages, as opposed to only 5% earlier this year. “As Secretary Duffy has said, staffing shortages have increased across the country. Air traffic controllers are still required to report to work and carry out their critical duties. The safety and efficiency of our airspace depend on them,” Bedford said in the memo. He also vowed to delay flights whenever necessary to make sure they are safe. “I also want to be very clear that safety will never be compromised. When staffing constraints occur, we will reduce the flow of air traffic into affected airports and centers to maintain safe operations,” Bedford said. “We will get through this together and continue delivering for the American people.” On Tuesday, air traffic controllers will receive a partial paycheck for hours worked before the shutdown. They will not be paid for the time they are working now until the government reopens. Duffy said on Thursday he will not allow air traffic controllers to use their position as a “bludgeon” for political purposes, including calling out sick during the government shutdown. There has been a shortage of air traffic controllers for years, so even a small number of unscheduled absences can lead to delayed flights “When we have small sick outs, if you will, it has massive impacts on the airspace,” the secretary said in an interview with CNN partner Scripps News. “We can’t be held hostage, anywhere in government or in our lives, with people who are going to use their positions as a bludgeon.” Duffy noted most controllers are “great people” but he reiterated his commitment to fire the “small few” who chose not to come to work to protest the shutdown. “If they’re sick, they’re sick. I’m fine with that. But if they’re not showing up to work, and they’re calling out for other reasons, and it’s coordinated and they collaborate on it, I don’t want those people working in air traffic,” he said. “I’m not going to have them leverage our system, our air travel system, for political benefit. I don’t like it, and so I’m willing to make changes that are necessary so that doesn’t happen again in the future.” Local leaders of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) spoke about the importance of air traffic controllers continuing to show up to work in a video message published on the 10th day of the federal government shutdown. “Even though some aspects of the government may shut down, we never do,” Vanesa Hess, facility vice president at Denver Center, said in the video. Patrick James, a facility president at Kansas City Center, said it was “vitally important” for air traffic controllers to “continue to show up to work and maintain the safe skies the American people deserve.” “I urge you – if you’re fit for duty, continue to serve the American flying public,” Alex Cisneros, facility president at Southern California TRACON, said in the video message. In a separate video released Friday, the head of NATCA urged elected officials to end the federal shutdown and pushed back on the “persistent false narrative that air traffic controllers somehow control its outcome.” “Let me be clear: air traffic controllers did not start this shutdown, and we will not be responsible for ending it,” NATCA president Nick Daniels said in a video statement Friday. NATCA represents nearly 11,000 certified Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers and more than 3,300 trainees, according to the organization. Daniels said the system has been facing challenges for years, adding that hundreds of ATC Zero events – where a control facility shuts down – earlier this year received little media attention. The control tower at Burbank Hollywood Airport went ATC Zero earlier this week when there were not enough staff to operate it. “The difference now is the extreme attention being paid to these things and the unfair assignment of blame on the aviation professionals that continue to keep this nation’s airspace running during a government shutdown,” he said. Daniels said his organization will continue to work alongside the Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford to address some of the problems facing the air traffic control system, including by increasing hiring and modernizing equipment. “The current shutdown is an unfortunate obstacle to achieving these important shared goals, and at this moment of historic aviation challenges, NATCA’s leaders and its members remain steadfast,” the president said. He thanked air traffic controllers for their “unwavering professionalism.” “You are highly trained, highly skilled, and uniquely positioned to make sure that the system remains the safest and most efficient in the world,” Daniels said. “You remain the unsung heroes of the aviation system even as you work without a paycheck with no clear end in sight.”", "tags": ["continue", "traffic", "problems", "air", "control", "delays", "shutdown"]},
{"content": "A former family doctor who has been by more than 160 of his patients surrendered to authorities Friday in Oregon, where he was arraigned on felony sexual abuse charges. David B. Farley turned himself in at the Clackamas County Jail in the early hours of the morning. A county grand jury indicted Farley on nine counts of sexual abuse and two related counts, all felonies, involving three female patients over a span of 11 years. One of the patients was under 14. Farley, 67, appeared for his arraignment Friday afternoon via closed-circuit TV and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. The courtroom’s gallery was crowded, with some observers weeping quietly during the brief proceeding. A judge set a December 6 trial date. The moment marks a dramatic turning point in what has been a years-long journey for the scores of women and girls who allege Farley sexually abused them under the guise of medical treatment. Some of the survivors have been urging authorities for more than five years to bring him to justice. “The relief that ran through my body…is indescribable,” a former patient of Farley’s told CNN, speaking anonymously out of caution over the ongoing legal proceedings. “Just to know that finally something is being done on the law enforcement side after so many failures from prior law enforcement agencies brings peace in my life.” The doctor was first investigated in 2020, when former patients came forward to file complaints with the Oregon Medical Board and local police about his conduct. Those complaints ranged from excessive breast and pelvic exams on underage patients to ungloved pelvic exams and Farley taking naked photographs of minors for what he claimed were educational purposes. Patients described sexual abuse as well as being subjected to medically unnecessary and painful procedures such as “hymenectomies” in which Farley would insist on , telling at least one teenaged patient he was doing so to “make sex more pleasurable.” Through his attorney, Farley has consistently declined to comment on the allegations against him. CNN reported on these allegations against Farley last year, sitting down with several of his former patients who described abuse they said they’d experienced and their quest for accountability. Many of the women found Farley through church. They were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in West Linn, Oregon — just south of Portland — and say he was seen as a leader in their tightknit Mormon community. The women say his status as a respected elder in the congregation conferred a level of trust that allowed him to take advantage of them. “I had no idea,” one of Farley’s former patients, Nicole Snow, told CNN last year. “I thought this was normal.” Snow said the abuse led to health problems that later caused her to drop out of high school. The Oregon Medical Board and revoked Farley’s medical license in October 2020. Meanwhile, the West Linn Police Department began to conduct its own investigation, led by District Attorney John Wentworth, and in 2022 the case went before a grand jury. But after deliberations, the grand jury said it did not have enough evidence for a criminal indictment, and Farley was not charged. Farley’s former patients allege Wentworth and his team fumbled the case, only allowing testimony from a small fraction of women who had filed police reports.  In a March 2024 op-ed , Wentworth defended his handling of the case, noting that “all known patients with a colorable claim of abuse testified before the grand jury.” In an email to CNN last year, he blamed “a litany of issues outside our control” for prosecutors’ inability to convince the grand jury. Many of Farley’s patients joined together in a 2020 civil suit against the former doctor. The lawsuit now includes more than 160 patients – some as young as five years old. The patients also continued to push the only available avenue for Farley to face criminal charges – lobbying for the state’s attorney general to reopen the criminal case. In December 2024, after years of defending its handling of the case, the Clackamas District Attorney’s office issued a request that the Oregon attorney general take over the investigation. The attorney general’s office did not comment publicly on the matter, except to say that it was reviewing the case. But the office had quietly been moving forward, conducting confidential sessions with a grand jury that heard witnesses and resulted last week in the indictment. The charges against Farley relate to alleged incidents that occurred between February 2009 and July 2020. “When these survivors first came forward in 2022 … their claims were scrutinized and dismissed rather than properly investigated,” said attorney Tom D’Amore, who represents Farley’s former patients in their civil lawsuit. “Their commitment to accountability, even in the face of such disregard, is nothing short of heroic.” “When I was assaulted, I thought I was alone, I thought I had misread things,” former patient Katie Medley, who detailed her abuse in an interview with CNN last year, said in a statement Friday. “My faith in our justice system was tried over the years. But my sister survivors and I have never stopped speaking out and now we have been vindicated.” Farley has since moved to Nephi, Utah, where he lives with his wife. A longtime friend of his told CNN that as of last year, Farley was still an active member of his church community there. A judge on Friday set bond for Farley at $500,000. Farley is permitted to leave the state if he posts bond, but signed an extradition waiver stating he won’t contest orders that he return to Oregon for court appearances and to stand trial.", "tags": ["doctor", "suburb", "women", "criminal", "facing", "charges", "years", "family"]},

{"content": "Federal courtrooms on opposite sides of the country on Thursday served as stages for between Democratic-led cities and the Trump administration, as judges weighed whether the president is exceeding his authority by deploying National Guard troops to quell demonstrations outside ICE facilities near Chicago and Portland. In a scathing oral ruling from Chicago, US District Court Judge April Perry granted a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration’s deployment of soldiers in the state of Illinois for two weeks. “I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers, Perry said, calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.” Sending in troops would “only add fuel to the fire,” Perry added. It’s unclear what the next steps will be for guardsmen already on the ground in the Chicago area. The Department of Defense told CNN troops “will remain in a federalized status” while the order is in force. Meanwhile on the West Coast, a three-judge panel with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered whether the Trump administration should be blocked from federalizing the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland. They have yet to release a decision, though said he expects a ruling “in the coming days.” Though the hearings occurred thousands of miles apart, the arguments were eerily similar, pitching both sides against each other as they painted starkly different pictures of the reality on the ground  – and fundamentally disagreed over whether it rises to the severity of federal intervention. The outcome of the twin hearings could set a precedent for future federal intervention in local law enforcement, though Trump has suggested he would the courts if they do not rule in his favor. Here are the key takeaways from today’s proceedings. Leaders in Oregon and Illinois have emphatically disputed the Trump administration’s characterizations of their cities as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court that the situation on the ground is not as extreme as federal officials are portraying it to be. In her ruling, Judge Perry noted the largest protests at the ICE facility in the suburb of Broadview, Illinois, did not exceed about 200 attendees. In that instance, she said, about 100 state and local law enforcement officers were present and capable of handling the crowd. Intervention from federal officials has not seemed necessary, and the deployment of troops into Chicago’s suburb could fuel “civil unrest,” Perry said. When federal officers have become involved, their use of chemical agents has “been arbitrary and indiscriminate,” she added, citing Broadview police.  Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson has previously accused federal agents of creating “chaos” by “needlessly deploying tear gas, pepper spray, mace and rubber bullets at individuals and reporters.” The Trump administration has accused protesters in Broadview of fostering “ongoing and sustained violence” against ICE personnel and federal property. In the administration’s filings in Chicago, attorneys claim injuries including a torn ACL, a hyper-extended knee, multiple lacerations, and a beard ripped from an officer’s face. Some officers have also been hospitalized after being physically tackled by rioters, the filing alleges. An Illinois attorney said by protesters against officials is “of course deplorable,” but local law enforcement should be given deference to handle the situation. The three-judge appeals court panel – which included two Trump appointees – challenged the Oregon attorney on several occasions during the hearing, appearing skeptical of their claims about the severity of the protests. During arguments, state Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin pointed out that a lower court found “that the Portland ICE facility protests were small, less than 30 people, largely sedate and generally peaceful.” Judge Ryan D. Nelson – a Trump appointee – shot back, saying the claim was “clearly erroneous.” “There’s clearly been protests that were above 30 (people),” Nelson said. “Unless you’re trying to limit it to certain time periods, we have evidence in the record that there were protests as much as 200.” “It was generally small,” Chaffin said. Department of Justice attorneys told the judges protests at the facility have federal agents. DOJ attorney Eric McArthur argued the demonstrators are “hardly the peaceful and sedate crowd” that the State of Oregon “tried to make it out to be.” The judges’ questions indicated their ruling may consider protests that took place in months past, not the current situation on the ground. Judge Bridget Bade, the other Trump appointee, noted the ICE facility was closed for more than three weeks starting in mid-June at the height of the protest violence. “Are those facts that are not relevant for the president to determine the threat and whether there’s a threat to DHS being able to enforce the 400 laws it’s tasked with enforcing?” asked Bade. Chaffin argued the court should not judge the need for military action in Portland now based on events from months ago. Oregon attorneys argued that Trump acted retroactively when he cited past clashes as justification for sending in the Guard. Nelson again challenged the state. “You’re saying, well, if you don’t hit it within a narrow window, you lose your right (to enact the military),” Nelson said. “That just seems unnaturally constrained.” Even if the court sides with the Trump administration and allows federalization of the Oregon National Guard, troops still cannot be deployed to Portland under a in effect until at least October 19. “Rebellion, Insurrection. War. These are heavy words,” an Illinois attorney said at the top of the Chicago hearing. Attorneys in both cases seemed to agree that the existential threat of a rebellion against the US government – one of the few circumstances in which the president has the legal authority to federalize the National Guard –  is a serious matter. But what constitutes a rebellion and how it is defined in the eyes of the law was the key point of disagreement between the states and the Trump administration in both hearings. “There is no rebellion in Illinois,” an attorney for the state said, calling the In her ruling, Perry said she saw no evidence of rebellion, which she defined as “deliberate, organized resistance openly opposing the government as a whole.” Earlier, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton argued there did not need to be a real act of rebellion, only the threat of one. He also said the court doesn’t need to decide what a rebellion is. “I think I do,” Perry replied. Meanwhile in Portland,  Judge Susan P. Graber asked the DOJ attorneys at the top of the hearing whether the demonstrations in Portland met the legal standard of a “rebellion.” McArthur, the DOJ attorney, said rebellion is “a deliberate, organized resistance by force and arms to the laws and operations of the government.” The state argued for a stricter legal definition. Chaffin said rebellions “are unusual and extreme emergencies,” pointing out that the other circumstances in which presidents have the power to federalize guardsmen involve invasion from foreign powers. She argued the situation should be considered a rebellion when circumstances arise, “which may be vital to the existence of the Union.” Pressed by Judge Perry about whether the National Guard presence in Illinois would be limited to certain locations, the Justice Department suggested they could be deployed beyond the area around the Broadview ICE facility. Perry asked whether soldiers may also be present in neighborhoods, including near schools. Hamilton said that it could be possible when protecting federal agents or property. “Will they be solving crime in Chicago?” Perry asked Hamilton. “Certainly, to an extent,” Hamilton responded. He added: “The mission, again, is a federal protective one.” As the Chicago hearing came to a close, the judge heard a final plea from the state, urging her to recognize what it sees as an existential threat to constitutionally protected states’ rights. Christopher Wells, an attorney from the Illinois Attorney General’s Office, asserted the day’s arguments represented one thing. “That fight is the Tenth Amendment. Full stop,” he said, referring to the amendment that reserves power for the states. Wells described Trump’s attempt to circumvent the state’s will as shocking and “authoritarian.” He warned the moment represented a “grave risk of wanton tyranny.” The Justice Department followed with closing statements, and Hamilton argued Trump’s judgment is “unreviewable.” One of the judges reviewing the Portland case acknowledged concerns about the potential for setting a dangerous precedent. Judge Nelson told the court he was not “trying to diminish” concerns that the National Guard’s deployment is a “slippery slope” and did not rule out the possibility that troops may be used unlawfully in the future. “I’m not trying to diminish that,” Nelson said of the concern of unlawful use of troops. “It may well be that the forces are used in an improper way, but we don’t have any evidence of that right now.” CNN’s Andy Rose and Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.", "tags": ["court", "guard", "battles", "key", "chicago", "troops", "decision", "national", "awaits", "portland"]},

Some flights in the air were able to land, with assistance from the approach controllers that normally guide planes to the airport, but usually hands them off to the tower for landing. “We actually just landed uncontrolled,” the pilot of a flight from Greensboro, South Carolina, told other pilots. “We’re just trying to see what to do next.” “Nobody has taxied, landed or taken off other than you in the last 15 minutes,” another pilot said. No planes took off, from what is typically the world busiest airport, between 5:11 p.m. and 5:52 p.m., according to FlightAware.  Only about five planes landed. The Atlanta Fire Rescue Department investigated and gave the all-clear, according to an airport spokesperson. Controllers returned to directing flights and takeoffs and landings resumed just before 6 p.m. Air traffic controllers are considered essential employees and are required to work during the government shutdown, but won’t be paid until it’s over.

{"content": "Just before midnight on New Year’s Eve, finished up a stint as an Uber driver and drove to a hiking area just north of Pacific Palisades, California. It was a familiar place for the 29-year-old – not far from where he had previously lived, according to a federal investigator who provided the following account of his movements that night in court documents. Rinderknecht got out of his car and hiked up the trail, past a sign stating “Danger” and “No Fires/Smoking,” toward a small clearing sometimes called the “Hidden Buddha” for a hollowed out stump where people placed Buddha figurines. At 11:47 p.m., he took out his iPhone and captured a 360-degree video of the area. Seven minutes later he played the song “ ” by the French rapper Josman, about despair and bitterness. There, by himself, with the world stretched out below, Rinderknecht entered into the New Year. At 12:12:01 a.m., a camera just under 5 miles away captured the first indication of a fire near that location, according to the court documents. That blaze soon developed into the Lachman Fire, which grew to eight acres before firefighters were able to knock it down on New Year’s Day. But the fire continued smoldering underground, and on the windy morning of January 7, it started up again. That “holdover” fire rapidly grew into the that swept through Pacific Palisades, destroying thousands of homes and businesses and killing 12 people, making it one of the most damaging wildfires in the region’s history. What exactly happened at the top of that hill as 2024 turned to 2025 is now the subject of a federal arson case against Rinderknecht. Investigators have determined the cause of the fire was an open flame, “likely a lighter,” to a combustible material like vegetation or paper, according to an affidavit in support of a criminal complaint filed this week. The affidavit, signed by an ATF special agent who is a certified fire investigator, accuses Rinderknecht of “maliciously” setting the fire just after midnight. At a news conference Wednesday, officials with the US Attorney’s Office and the ATF declined to speak to the suspect’s motive. “I wish we could get into somebody’s head, but we can’t,” said Special Agent in Charge Kenny Cooper of the ATF’s Los Angeles Field Division. “People do evil things for whatever reason, and I’m not going to speculate or go into anything of that.” Rinderknecht appeared in federal court in Orlando, where he is based, on Wednesday afternoon, and he did not enter a plea. A judge denied him bail in a hearing Thursday on concerns he was a flight risk, according to . Federal Assistant Public Defender Aziza Hawthorne said Rinderknecht was not a flight risk, adding “he is not a risk to anyone,” according to The Associated Press. If convicted, he faces a minimum of five years and a maximum of 20 years in prison. CNN has reached out to Rinderknecht’s attorney for comment. An examination of the 26-page affidavit reveals some of the gritty details of the eight-plus months of investigation that led to his arrest. There were high-tech methods: GPS data, fire-sensing cameras, DNA analysis and ChatGPT logs. There were decidedly low-tech methods: Closely watching his pulsing carotid artery during an interview, talking to hundreds of witnesses and through the charred remains of the fire for clues. “Part of the lengthy time that it took to go over the thousands of acres that were burned is we literally had agents with our partners on their hands and knees crawling through fire debris,” Cooper said at the news conference. Here’s a closer look at Rinderknecht’s alleged actions on the night of the fire and the extensive efforts to investigate its cause that led to his arrest. Months before the fire, Rinderknecht had sent curious prompts to ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence app, according to the affidavit. In July, he asked ChatGPT to produce a “dystopian painting” with three distinct parts, the affidavit says. “On the far left, there is a burning forest. Next to it, a crowd of people is running away from the fire,” he wrote. “In the middle, hundreds of thousands of people in poverty are trying to get past a gigantic gate with a big dollar sign on it. On the other side of the gate and the entire wall is a conglomerate of the richest people. They are chilling, watching the world burn down, and watching the people struggle.” The app spat out this image, according to prosecutors: Then in November, Rinderknecht wrote a prompt to ChatGPT saying he was 28 years old and mentioning a fiery event months prior, according to the affidavit. “I literally burnt the Bible that I had. It felt amazing. I felt so liberated,” he wrote. On New Year’s Eve, Rinderknecht appeared “agitated and angry,” two Uber passengers later told investigators. He dropped off a passenger at 11:34 p.m. and then went on up to the trailhead toward the Hidden Buddha area for the New Year, the affidavit says. In an email, Uber said Rinderknecht passed his initial background check in 2023. The company said it worked closely with the ATF to help determine his whereabouts on and around the New Year and provided the ATF with GPS data and other information. Uber said it removed his access to the platform after learning of his suspected involvement in the fire. Video footage and “Timing Advance” data from cell service providers showed he was the only person in the Hidden Buddha area that night, according to the affidavit. The first indication of a fire came at 12:12:01 a.m. from the camera about 4.7 miles away that was set up to detect wildfires, the affidavit says. Another camera just .2 miles from the Hidden Buddha area detected the glow of a fire at 12:12:21 a.m., the document states. At 12:12:31 a.m. and 12:12:50, Rinderknecht repeatedly tried to call 911, but the calls did not go through, according to cellphone data. GPS data of those calls shows him in and around the Hidden Buddha area, according to the affidavit. After several more failed attempts, his 911 call finally connected at 12:17 a.m. and he reported the presence of a fire, the affidavit states. During that call, he went to his ChatGPT app and asked a question: “Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarettes,” according to the affidavit. He made a screen-recording on his iPhone of several attempted 911 calls and his question to ChatGPT, the affidavit states. That action “indicates that Rinderknecht wanted to preserve evidence of himself trying to assist in the suppression of the fire and he wanted to create evidence regarding a more innocent explanation for the cause of the fire,” according to the affidavit. Rinderknecht got into his car and drove away, but then turned around after he spotted fire engines headed toward the scene, the affidavit states. He allegedly walked back up the same trail from earlier and took iPhone videos of the Lachman Fire and firefighters. By the next day, the fire appeared to those on scene to be extinguished. But it roared back to life less than a week later, leading to the Palisades Fire and its vast destruction throughout Pacific Palisades. The fire was finally contained on January 31. On January 24 – while the Palisades Fire was still burning – investigators interviewed Rinderknecht about his alleged actions on New Year’s Eve. In the interview, he made statements investigators determined were inconsistent with the GPS evidence about where he was when he first saw the fire and called 911, the affidavit states. He said one correct thing – that the fire began on the hillside below and south of the Hidden Buddha area, according to the affidavit. “The investigators are not aware of any other way for Rinderknecht to have known this non-public information other than having witnessed the start of the fire,” the affidavit states. Further, the investigators noticed his carotid artery “would pulsate and become visible” when they asked how the fire started and who started it, a physical symptom supposedly indicating he was “extremely anxious” about that issue, according to the affidavit. Still, determining how the Lachman Fire on New Year’s Eve actually began required painstaking analysis. As the affidavit explains, investigators ruled out fireworks, lightning, power lines and sunlight refraction. They examined smoking as a possible cause based on Rinderknecht’s statement that he sometimes smoked, but determined the weather conditions were inconsistent with the theory. Instead, they concluded the fire was incendiary and likely started from a lighter. The affidavit gives several clues as to the identity of the specific lighter. On December 31, a video from Rinderknecht’s iPhone showed what appeared to be a green, barbecue-style lighter in his apartment, the affidavit states. That same lighter was found in the glove compartment of his car on January 24. Rinderknecht’s DNA was found on the lighter, the affidavit says. In cellphone video taken on January 1 at 1:44 a.m., over an hour after the fire began, the glove compartment of his car was open. During his January 24 interview with investigators, Rinderknecht admitted he brought a lighter to the Hidden Buddha area, the affidavit states. He said he could not remember which kind.

{"content": "Eighteen people are dead or missing after a massive blast obliterated a building at a Tennessee explosives facility on Friday, authorities said — a “mass detonation” so significant that it rattled homes miles away. The early-morning explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems, which manufactures military and demolition explosives, left charred debris and mangled vehicles across a vast area. The blast was felt as far as 15 miles away and scattered debris over half a square mile. Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said there are fatalities but did not want to declare a death toll yet. “I always wish for the best,” Davis said. “Is there a possibility that somebody might be injured somewhere, or somebody that we don’t know about? Yes.” Officials previously said they were “missing 19 souls,” but later clarified one person who was initially believed to be at the plant was located at their home. Investigators are working to confirm who was at the facility Friday morning and notifying victims’ families, according to a joint release from Hickman and Humphreys County officials Friday night. “Our hearts are with the families still waiting for word tonight. We are doing everything possible to bring them information and support,” the release said. As of Friday evening, authorities were still working to contact some of the next-of-kin of employees who were believed to have been inside the building at the time of the explosion, a law enforcement source tells CNN. As part of the ongoing effort to determine which company employees may have been among the victims, the source said authorities are now also conducting analysis of records from nearby cell phone towers. The sophisticated process involves comparing the cell phone numbers of employees with local cell phone tower registration records to help pinpoint the geographical location of a device at the time of the explosion. Davis described the aftermath of the explosion as “the most devastating scene that I’ve seen in my career.” “It’s hell,” Davis told reporters Friday evening. “It’s hell on us. It’s hell on everybody involved.” Work at the explosion site will continue into the night, he said. “We’re working for our people, and we want to take care of our families,” an emotional Davis said. “I understand that some families get mad. I understand that some people get upset … We’re doing the very best we can to take care of this.” Davis said investigators from multiple agencies have been assisting with the response but have not yet determined what caused the explosion. The FBI will be assisting. “Do I see a short-term explanation? No. Do I see us being here for many days? Yes, I do see that,” he said. Davis noted people were undergoing a “gauntlet of emotions” as first responders continued to search the area. The tragedy hit close-knit communities. “I can tell you right off the top of my head that there’s three families that’s involved in this that I’m very close to,” Davis said. “When you have small counties like this, we know each other, we communicate with each other, we love each other.” The blast shook nearby homes and set off smaller explosions, local officials say. The explosion, which happened around 7:45 a.m. local time, was a “devastating blast,” but responders were able to secure the scene by late morning, Davis said. Three people with “minor injuries” from the explosion were treated at TriStar medical facilities in Dickson, Casey Stapp, the spokesperson for TriStar Health, said. Stapp said two people were released, and one person is still receiving treatment at an emergency room. In a statement Friday evening, Accurate Energetic Systems called the blast at its facility a “tragic accident.” “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, coworkers, and community members affected by this incident,” the company on Facebook. “We extend our gratitude to all first responders who continue to work tirelessly under difficult conditions.” The company, which specializes in making military explosives, is located about an hour southwest of Nashville, Tennessee, on the Hickman and Humphreys County line, the Humphreys County Sheriff’s Office told CNN. The company’s says it manufactures “various high explosive compositions and specialty products for the U.S. DoD and U.S. Industrial markets.” Last month, the US Department of Defense a contract for nearly $120 million “for the procurement of TNT.” Hickman County Mayor Jim Bates said the facility has about 80 employees, but it’s unclear how many were in the building when the explosion happened. Bates said one building on the site was completely destroyed. “It’s pretty devastating to see this,” Bates said. “It’s going to be an investigation that’s probably going to go on for days,” the mayor said. “This facility, they do manufacture, not only military, but demolition explosives for road work and things like that.” Numerous law enforcement resources from across Tennessee have been dispatched to assist in the investigation, including federal agents and the Tennessee Highway Patrol Special Operations Unit, a source familiar told CNN. More than 300 emergency personnel were at the scene Friday, officials said. The Hickman County Sheriff’s Office, Humphreys County Sheriff’s Office and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation. Recovery and investigative work will continue through the weekend and the ATF’s National Response Team is expected to arrive Saturday to process the scene, a release from officials said. The relatively remote area is typically patrolled by smaller law enforcement departments, the person said, which has prompted other agencies to volunteer resources for support. The Hickman County Sheriff’s Office is asking everyone to avoid the area as emergency responders do their work. Tennessee state Sen. Kerry Roberts told CNN the facility sits on a 1,300-acre campus and is a beloved employer for many people in the community. He said it’s common to see employees at community events and people wearing baseball caps with the company name on them. “It is a well-loved company in the area,” Roberts said. “So this is going to have a devastating impact on quite a few families … it is heartbreaking.” Residents who live near the facility say they felt the impact of the explosion. “I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,” Gentry Stover told The Associated Press by phone. “I live very close to Accurate and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.” Cody Warren, who lives in Lobelville, about 21 miles away from the facility, said the sound from the explosion woke him up and he thought lightning struck his house. The plant suffered another blast that killed a worker a decade ago, according to media reports, and federal data shows it had faced fines related to work safety practices. In April 2014, one person was killed and four others injured during a blast at the plant, CNN affiliate . The explosion, in the back of a building that housed shotgun ammunition, caused extensive damage. At the time, authorities said several companies operated on the Accurate Energetic Systems property but the blast happened in an area operated by Rio Ammunition. Years later, records from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration show Accurate Energetic Systems was $7,200 after a 2019 inspection found violations for standards involving the use of personal protective equipment, employee exposure to contaminants and employee training about safety hazards, among other citations. The records show the company contested the violations and eventually came to a formal settlement. Additional details about the inspection and its conclusions weren’t immediately available, and it’s not clear whether the plant has faced any more recent health or safety inspections. Over the last nine years, Accurate Energetic Systems filed annual injury with OSHA showing it had a total of 46 work-related injuries, but no work-related deaths going back to 2016, the earliest year with data available. In 2024, the most recent year data was available, the company reported five injuries and one other illness. In 2021, a former employee sued and alleged they were improperly terminated after being blamed for a fire that broke out at the facility the previous year. The company disputed that claim and the suit was dropped after mediation.

{"content": "Lawyers for asked a New York federal judge Saturday to dismiss some criminal charges, including the only count for which he could face the death penalty, from a federal indictment brought against him in the December assassination of . In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, the lawyers said prosecutors should also be prevented from using at trial his statements to law enforcement officers and his backpack where a gun and ammunition were found. They said Mangione was not read his rights before he was questioned by law enforcement officers, who arrested him after Brian Thompson was fatally shot as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. They added that officers did not obtain a warrant before searching Mangione’s backpack. Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges in the fatal shooting of Brian Thompson on December 4 as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for his company’s annual investor conference. The killing set off a multi-state search after the suspected shooter slipped away from the scene and rode a bike to Central Park, before taking a taxi to a bus depot that offers service to several nearby states. , a tip from a McDonald’s about 233 miles away in Altoona, Pennsylvania, led police to arrest Mangione. He has been held without bail since then. Last month, asked that his federal charges be dismissed and the death penalty be taken off the table as a result of public comments by US Attorney General Pam Bondi. In April, Bondi directed prosecutors in New York to seek the death penalty, calling the killing of Thompson a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.” Murder cases are usually tried in state courts, but prosecutors have also charged Mangione under a federal law on murders committed with firearms as part of other “crimes of violence.” It’s the only charge for which Mangione could face the death penalty, since it’s not used in New York state. The papers filed early Saturday morning argued that this charge should be dismissed because prosecutors have failed to identify the other offenses that would be required to convict him, saying that the alleged other crime — stalking — is not a crime of violence. The assassination and its aftermath has captured the American imagination, setting off a cascade of resentment and toward U.S. health insurers while concerned about security. After the killing, investigators found the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose,” written in permanent marker on ammunition at the scene.

{"content": "A federal appeals court ruled Saturday the National Guard troops in Illinois can remain under federal control but can’t be deployed as the appeals process continues in the ongoing showdown between the Trump administration and the state. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to temporarily pause part of a lower court’s order this week that halted deployments of National Guard troops in the state for – the latest in a bicoastal court saga over whether President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority by deploying troops to quell demonstrations outside ICE facilities near Democratic-led cities like Chicago and Portland. “Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the order says. Troops in the Chicago area are now engaged in “planning and training,” but “not conducting any operational activities at this time,” US Northern Command said in a Friday update. There were 300 members of the Illinois National Guard and 200 members of the Texas National Guard activated under Title 10 and in the Chicago area as of Wednesday, the command previously said. The Trump administration had filed a notice of appeal this week against US District Court Judge April Perry’s decision Thursday to grant a temporary restraining order blocking Trump’s National Guard deployment in Illinois. “I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers, Perry said in her ruling, calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.” Sending in troops would “only add fuel to the fire,” the judge added. Leaders in areas like Illinois and Oregon have emphatically disputed the Trump administration’s characterizations of their cities as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court that the situation on the ground is not as extreme as federal officials are portraying it to be. On the West Coast, a three-judge panel with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is still weighing whether the Trump administration should be blocked from deploying the Oregon National Guard to respond to ICE protests in Portland. They have yet to release a decision, though on Thursday said he expects a ruling “in the coming days.” The appeals court ruled Wednesday to temporarily allow the federalization of the Oregon National Guard, while the block against deploying the troops remains in effect.

{"content": "Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has propelled markets to this year. But the fierce ascent has also raised concerns about a bubble. AI has been the dominant theme in markets since 2022, when OpenAI first launched ChatGPT. Optimism has since spread among investors about a potential transformative AI boom, and enormous amounts of money have flowed into tech stocks. Valuations have risen to . To some analysts and economists, those are red flags that the market might be in a bubble — when investors bid up stock prices beyond what they’re worth, creating an unsustainable rally that often results in a significant downturn, as seen during the dot-com bubble that burst in 2000. “Fired up by optimism about the productivity-enhancing potential of AI, global equity prices are surging,” Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech on Wednesday. “Today’s valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago,” Georgieva said. “If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth.” Jamie Dimon, chief executive at JPMorgan Chase, said he thinks “AI is real,” but some money being invested now will “probably” be wasted. “Take AI, there’s a lot of money going into it,” Dimon said in an interview with the BBC. “AI is real, AI in total will pay off. Just like cars in total paid off, and TVs in total paid off. But most people involved in them didn’t do well.” Dimon also said he thinks there is a higher chance of a meaningful drop in stocks in the next six months to two years than what is being reflected in the market. “I am far more worried about that than others,” Dimon said. “I would give it a higher probability than I think is probably priced in the market and by others.” “The level of uncertainty should be higher in most people’s minds than what I would call normal,” he said, adding that geopolitics and government debt burdens are contributing to the uncertain outlook. Big tech companies like Meta ( ), Microsoft ( ) and Amazon ( ) have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on to build out and power AI, and have earmarked hundreds of billions of dollars for more spending. These companies’ earnings results continue to impress Wall Street, supporting elevated valuations and the rally in stocks. Yet some investors said there are questions about whether the spending and AI aspirations will eventually generate enough returns to justify the enormous buildout. Concerns are growing about whether it is sustainable and what the fallout might be if there is a significant drop in stocks. Concerns about a potential bubble intensified in recent weeks as AI stars like Nvidia and OpenAI announced deals with that raised eyebrows that the top players might be propping up the market. The rise in valuations and emergence of circular financing are among aspects that “rhyme with previous bubbles,” according to strategists at Goldman Sachs. “While it appears we are not in a bubble yet, high levels of market concentration and competition in the AI space suggest investors should continue to focus on diversification,” the strategists said in a note. Despite concerns, anything related to AI has been in high demand. OpenAI on Monday with chip company Advanced Micro Devices ( ), sending AMD’s shares soaring almost 24%. The rally has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble. However, investors said there is a key difference: Big Tech companies now are actually profitable and delivering strong earnings results. “Unlike the 1990s tech bubble that featured soaring stocks from unprofitable early-stage companies, strong mega-cap company earnings are driving this year’s rally,” Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Asset Management, said in a note. Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, said the market is signaling “bubble light” territory. He said investor sentiment has not yet reached the levels of exuberance that would signal the market is at peak risk levels. “Valuations, positioning and flows are all certainly signaling that we’re in bubble light territory, but sentiment has just not got there yet,” Mullaney said. “And so this thing could still run.” Big Tech is an increasingly influential part of the S&P 500, which is weighted by companies’ market value. As AI-related stocks have carried the market to record highs, they have also become a more significant part of people’s 401(k) retirement plans. While the rapid growth of tech stocks lets individual investors and people saving for retirement take part in companies’ gains, it leaves people vulnerable to a potential extended drawdown if a bubble bursts. Just seven stocks — Alphabet ( ), Amazon, Apple ( ), Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia ( ) and Tesla ( ) — have accounted for 55% of the S&P 500’s gains since the end of 2022, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The Bank of England on Wednesday said the risk of a sharp downturn in the stock market has increased. “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence,” the bank said in a quarterly report. “This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,” the bank said. In 1996, then-Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan famously asked whether “irrational exuberance” might be taking hold in financial markets. While Greenspan warned that the stock market could be running too hot on emotion, the dot-com bubble peak did not happen until four years later in 2000. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on September 23 said stocks are “fairly highly valued,” drawing comparisons to his predecessor’s comments 30 years ago. Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note: “Is the stock market back on the road to the same irrational exuberance that inflated the Tech Bubble of 1999, which was followed by the Tech Wreck of the early 2000s? Perhaps.” “However, the S&P 500 has been driven to new highs this year by better-than-expected earnings,” Yardeni said. “We are still targeting the S&P 500 to get to 7,700 by the end of next year.”", "tags": ["jamie", "market", "correction", "dimon", "stock"]},
{"content": "YouTube on Thursday will begin offering previously banned users the opportunity to create new accounts and potentially re-publish some videos that may have contributed to their termination but no longer violate YouTube’s rules. YouTube last month announced the plan to allow previously banned users and their content back on the video platform. The move was announced following an investigation by Republican lawmakers into whether the Biden administration pressured tech companies to remove certain types of content. YouTube said that over the past couple of years, it did away with rules that had prohibited users from repeatedly posting misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 US election outcome. Now, users terminated for breaking those rules have the chance to return. “We know many terminated creators deserve a second chance – YouTube has evolved and changed over the past 20 years, and we’ve had our share of second chances to get things right with our community too,” the company said in a blog post Thursday. “We appreciate the patience as we ramp up, carefully review requests, and learn as we go.” The decision to permit banned users to rejoin the platform is the latest example of how YouTube — — has loosened its content moderation efforts in recent years, that has accelerated across Silicon Valley this year amid pressure from conservatives. Here’s what we know about the effort. Some previously banned users will see the option to request a new account when they sign into their old pages starting on Thursday. The option won’t be available to everyone right away; a YouTube spokesperson said the platform wants to make sure wait times aren’t too long as it reviews each request. Users won’t have the option until one year after their original channel was terminated. Requests will be reviewed based on considerations such as whether the user’s rules violations were “severe and persistent,” YouTube said in its Thursday post. Think, for example, whether they previously tried to circumvent YouTube’s rules by attempting to create a new account while on a temporary suspension, the spokesperson said. YouTube will also consider a user’s behavior on third-party platforms to gauge whether they could “continue to harm the YouTube community.” “This pilot won’t be available to creators terminated for copyright infringement, those who have violated our Creator Responsibility policies, or those who deleted their YouTube channel/Google account,” YouTube said in its blog post. It’s not clear how long the review process will take, but a YouTube spokesperson said users will receive an email with their results. Users who are approved won’t be able to fire up their old channels with their original followers lists. They’ll have to start fresh. However, users will be able to re-upload content from their old accounts so long as it follows YouTube’s current rules. And because YouTube’s Community Guidelines have changed, videos that might have contributed to a user’s previous banning — for example, with false claims about Covid-19 or the 2020 election — may now be permitted. Like any other user, these reinstated creators will have the chance to apply to YouTube’s Partner Program to earn money from their channel once it meets the program’s guidelines. And rules enforcement will start fresh, too — they’ll be subject to the same as any new user, according to the spokesperson. YouTube’s spokesperson said the change aligns with a broader push to ensure users fully understand the rules before they’re booted from the platform. In its letter announcing the change earlier this month, YouTube said the move reflects its “commitment to free expression.” “YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse,” states the letter, which was sent to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan. The language echoes statements made by other tech platforms this year as many have altered their policies to align more closely with the views of President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was “going back to our roots around free expression” by ending partnerships with third-party fact checkers. Some of Youtube’s now-defunct guidelines had led to enforcement against prominent figures. For example, an account belonging to Children’s Health Defense Fund, a group affiliated with now-Health and Human Services Secretary and longtime vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., was removed for posting vaccine misinformation in 2021. The same year, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s account was for posting about dubious Covid-19 treatments.", "tags": ["old", "letting", "rules", "users", "youtube", "means", "videos"]},

Silver prices have surged roughly 75% this year, boosted by investors seeking out safe havens, plus strong industrial demand and lingering supply deficits. Spot silver prices hit a record high $51 a troy ounce on Thursday, breaching the $50 threshold for the first time since 1980. Traders have turned to hard assets like gold and silver this year as safe investments and tools to hedge against geopolitical instability and economic uncertainty, from concerns about tariffs and inflation to worries about Federal Reserve independence and government debt burdens. Silver has been on a tear, supported by momentum from gold’s record-breaking rally. The metal is considered a cheaper, alternative safe haven investment to gold, which just hit for the first time ever. “There’s just a lot of concern about the global economy, and when that happens, people turn to hard assets like silver,” Michael DiRienzo, CEO of the Silver Institute, previously told CNN. “Silver tends to follow gold upwards.” While investor demand is driving up prices, silver also has widespread industrial uses, including in building data centers, solar panels and smartphones. “Its dual role as an industrial metal and safe-haven asset has amplified the rally, making 2025 a historic year for silver,” Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, said in an email. There are also supply concerns that could underpin higher prices. The silver market is in its fifth year of a structural supply deficit because of “stagnant mining output” lagging behind demand, according to Peter Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals. “Strong and growing demand for silver, combined with a persistent supply deficit, is a recipe for higher prices,” Grant said in an email. Gold prices have soared across the past two years, driven by investors diversifying into safe havens. on the dollar and building reserves of gold also boosted prices. The safe-haven rally has spread out to other precious metals like silver and platinum this year. Silver and platinum, which are up roughly 75% and 80% this year, respectively, are both outpacing gold, which is up roughly 51%. Precious metals and bitcoin have also become beneficiaries of Wall Street traders and fund managers looking to protect against a weaker dollar. Investors can get exposure to silver by buying bars or coins or investing in exchange-traded funds backed by silver. The iShares Silver Trust ETF has surged roughly 68% this year. Inflows into silver ETFs this year are at their highest level since 2020, according to Maria Smirnova, chief investment officer at Sprott Asset Management. “Silver’s steady climb is turning into a breakout,” Smirnova said. “Supply is thinning, and investors are taking notice.”", "tags": ["hit", "decades", "price", "silver", "ounce", "highest"]},

Additionally, the United States “directly” purchased Argentine pesos, Bessent said, a rare move that marks the latest step in an attempt to stabilize the country’s financial market. Bessent did not specify how many pesos the United States had purchased. Representatives from the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. “The U.S. Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets,” Bessent wrote. The $20 billion lifeline framework Bessent announced is known as a “currency swap,” which gives Argentina’s central bank the ability to exchange pesos for US dollars with the Treasury. Doing so can help stabilize its financial markets by injecting more liquidity. The Argentine peso has significantly devalued against other currencies since President Javier Milei, a close ally of President Donald Trump, suffered major defeats in local elections, raising doubts that he’ll hold on to his legislative majority in midterm elections later this month. Trump has praised the chainsaw-wielding libertarian and his reelection. But the Trump administration’s attempt to rescue Milei’s economy has been , given Trump preaches an “America First” agenda.

{"content": "The IRS on Thursday announced adjustments it is making to a host of line items on your federal tax return for this year and next. Those updates are the result of changes in inflation but also due to provisions in the enacted in July. How the adjustments will affect you has everything to do with what deductions you take and what your taxable income will be. But, generally speaking, “many taxpayers will see modest ‘relief’ simply because the deductions and thresholds move upward. Inflation will take less of a bite,” said Tom O’Saben, director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Professionals. Among the changes are: Most filers claim the standard deduction, and they do so because it exceeds the value of the deductions they would otherwise take if they . The increases in the standard deduction by 2026 “will shift more income into the ‘zero bracket’ — (meaning it will not) be taxed because the deduction covers more,” O’Saben said. For tax year 2025, returns for which will be due in April of next year, the new tax law raised the standard deduction to $15,750 for single filers, up from the $15,000 that had previously been scheduled. For married couples filing jointly, it will be $31,500, up from $30,000. And for heads of households, their standard deduction will be $23,625, up from $22,500. From there, for tax year 2026, the IRS is adjusting the standard deduction for inflation — something it does every year. As a result, the standard will rise to $16,100 for single filers; $32,200 for joint filers; and $24,150 for heads of households. The IRS also made inflation adjustments for 2026 to the income ranges that apply to each of the seven federal income tax rates. As the IRS has explained, “When your income jumps to a higher tax bracket, you don’t pay the higher rate on your entire income. You pay the higher rate only on the part that’s in the new tax bracket.” The adjustments are not uniform — some ranges increased by roughly 3.9% while others increased by about 2.3% relative to this year. “The uneven increases are normal artifacts of the IRS’s inflation adjustment methodology — not a policy choice to favor one income level over another,” O’Saben said. In 2026, you will pay: The EITC is an especially valuable credit for low-income households. Credits are a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the taxes you owe. And, since it is a refundable credit, it can increase your refund if you don’t have much or any income tax liability. The IRS is increasing the value of the credit for next year. For instance, eligible tax filers with three or more children may claim a maximum of $8,231, up from $8,046 this year.

First things first: Many critics have deemed Swift’s 12th studio album a miss, and I’m not going to sit here and tell the critics they’re wrong (at least, not about ). I can squint and point out the album’s gems — I think “Wood” is fun, actually — but that kind of analysis is best reserved for my My job here is to point out why I think is a savvy business play masquerading as Millennial cringe. In short: It’s novelty Oreos. Five years ago, the New York Times’ that those limited-edition Oreos — with weird flavors like Root Beer Float or PB&J or Key Lime Pie — are all part of a clever marketing strategy by the cookie brand: “Novelty Oreos sell reasonably well … But the sales are not the point. Novelty Oreos… play a much purer role: They help drive consumers back to milk’s alleged favorite, the 108-year-old paterfamilias, the plain old Oreo. In other words, the new flavors function as advertisements for the original.” You take a weird flavor that is decidedly not for everyone and chuck it into the world like chum. “Piña Colada Oreo Thins,” to a reasonable person, sound certifiably insane. If you were to walk by such an abomination in the grocery store you might shake your head and say, Might as well buy a box of the original recipe now while you still can. It is a madman theory of marketing, and it . Bromwich writes that over a three-year period when sales of novelty Oreos were up 12%, sales of the classic were up nearly 22%. is Taylor Swift’s Piña Colada Oreo. We’re not suggesting that Taylor would put out an album that was less than her best but it hardly matters. The result is still a weird Oreo, and a weird Oreo can be — when you’re as successful as Taylor Swift — great for the brand and the bottom line. Because who makes money when you’re done giving a try and decide it’s time to revisit ? Miss Taylor Alison Swift. Earlier this year, outright, reclaiming her masters from Shamrock Capital, the private equity firm that bought the recordings from Swift’s first music label. That means all the revenue from all her past work — album sales, merchandise, films, the works — goes into her pocket. “Unlike most celebrities,” my colleague Ramishah Maruf writes, “Swift has made lucrative business dealings a part of her persona, positioning herself at the vanguard of the long narrative in the music business that unseen executives received much of the money actually generated by artists.” Any time Swift releases a new album, Ramishah notes, streaming of her previous work (good ol’ plain or Double Stuf Oreos) also spikes. To be sure, is no commercial flop, even if the critical reception is mixed. As of Thursday, it was closing in on the modern-era record for album sales in a single week, potentially dethroning Adele’s 2015 masterwork, , (which notes the modern era data date to 1991). The Swifties are clearly not letting withering critiques from The Standard (“I was beginning to wonder if I was accidentally listening to a parody album hallucinated by some porn-addled AI”) or Pitchfork (“ sounds like much of the pop music you have heard over the past 10 years and throughout your lifetime) spoil their fun. Addressing the mixed reviews, Swift offered the kind of “all press is good press” reasoning you’d expect from a billionaire brand executive. “The rule of show business is, if it’s the first week of my album release, and you are saying either my name or my album title, you’re helping,” she told podcast host Zane Lowe this week. “I know what I made.

{"content": "US federal regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla’s self-driving feature after dozens of incidents in which the cars ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday that it is looking into 58 incidents in which Teslas reportedly violated traffic safety laws while using the company’s so-called Full Self-Driving mode, leading to more than a dozen crashes and fires and nearly two dozen injuries. The new probe adds to several other open investigations into Tesla technology that could upend Elon Musk’s plans to turn millions of his cars already on the road into completely driverless vehicles with an over-the-air update to their software. “The ultimate question is, ‘Does the software work?’” asked Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst with a “sell” rating on the stock. Added money manager Ross Gerber, “The world has become a giant testing ground for Elon’s concept of full self-driving, and it’s not working,” The probe comes as Musk, whose fortune as the world’s richest man derives partly from Tesla’s levitating stock, has promised to roll out hundreds of thousands of driverless taxis in cities around the United States by the end of next year. The new investigation covers 2.9 million vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, a misnomer criticized for lulling drivers into handing full control over to their cars. Tesla has argued to regulators and in court cases that it has repeatedly told drivers the system cannot drive the cars by itself and whoever is behind the wheel must be ready to intervene at all times. In the new probe, regulators reported that many of the Tesla drivers involved in accidents said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior. Tesla ( ) stock fell nearly 3% at one point Thursday but closed with a loss of just 0.7%. The agency behind the latest probe, NHTSA, opened an investigation last year into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed. NHTSA also opened an investigation earlier this year for a “summon” technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up after reports of several fender benders in parking lots. Another investigation was launched by the agency in August looking into why Tesla apparently has not been reporting crashes promptly as required. That same month, a Miami that Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly 2019 crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology — which is different than full self-driving — and must pay the victims more than $240 million in damages. Tesla said it would appeal the decision. Money manager Gerber, a long-time Tesla investor who says he once was a big believer in the company’s driver assistance feature, says the company should stop calling it full self-driving and admit the vision-only system using cameras on its cars needs to be supplemented with radar sensors and other hardware. Otherwise, regulators should force it to do that. “They have to take responsibility for the fact that the software doesn’t work right and either adjust the hardware accordingly — and Elon can just deal with his ego issues — or somebody is gonna have to come in and say, ‘Hey, you keep causing accidents with this stuff and maybe you should just put it on test tracks until it works,’” he said. The FSD system under investigation is what is called Level 2 driver-assistance software that requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. A new version of FSD was introduced earlier this week. The company is also testing a vastly upgraded version that does not require driver intervention, something that Musk has been promising to roll out for years. Tesla is under pressure to show success with FSD because the main part of its business — selling cars — is struggling. Customers who don’t like Musk’s support of President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe have boycotted the company, sinking sales. Meanwhile, rival electric vehicle makers, including China’s BYD, are stealing market share with cheaper, high-quality offerings. In response, Musk on Tuesday announced Tesla would be selling two new, stripped-down and cheaper versions of models already on the road, including its best-selling Model Y. But investors, hoping for lower prices or a completely new offering, were unimpressed, pushing the stock down 4.5%.", "tags": ["drove", "driving", "side", "self", "tesla", "wrong", "cars", "road", "investigation", "lights", "feature"]},

Thursday night on ABC, Jimmy Kimmel tossed to a “special report” from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, “ .” Pritzker, wearing body armor, played a TV reporter in the video clip. “We’ve seen people being forced to eat hot dogs with ketchup on them,” the governor quipped. While Kimmel’s show was airing, a real reporter for The Oregonian was recording a video outside the ICE facility that has long been a magnet for protests in Portland. The topic: “ .” The video showcased how Portlanders are wearing inflatable costumes to mock what one of the frog cosplayers called “insane government overreach.” The dress-up “dismantles their narrative a little bit,” Jack Dickinson, also known as the “Portland Chicken,” . “It becomes much harder to take them seriously when they have to post a video saying Kristi Noem is up on the balcony staring over the Antifa Army and it’s, like, eight journalists and five protesters and one of them is in a chicken suit.” Pritzker and Dickinson have something in common: They’re using the tools at their disposal — smart phone cameras, social media apps and satire — to turn “war” rhetoric into a punchline. “The Daily Show” did it too, with labeled “REAL footage from Portland, 2025. Viewer discretion is advised.” Conservative journalist Andy Ngo early Friday morning by claiming the costumes in Portland “serve the function of masking the violent extremism to make the direct action appear like a family-friendly gathering on camera, and to whitewash the past ultraviolence.” So, as always, it comes down to videos and posts people choose to believe. However, “in the bifurcated media world of 2025, one side’s comparative calm is the other’s ‘hellscape’ — as the White House described Portland on Wednesday — and the narrative that the Trump administration has wanted has been supplied by a coterie of right-wing influencers elevated by Mr. Trump himself,” The New York Times’s Anna Griffin and Aaron West wrote in . Trump’s is just one example. “Right-wing podcasters, writers and pundits are flocking to Democratic deep-blue cities to document the scene for their massive audiences but also, in some cases such as Portland, to spar with left-wing demonstrators,” NBC’s David Ingram and Jo Yurcaba . It’s often helpful to think of pseudo-events like these anti-ICE protests as stages, because then you can observe the performers accordingly. Take this quote, for example: Local TV reporter-turned-MAGA poster Jonathan Choe , “This is now a full-blown information war that we’re in, so being on the front lines is more important than ever…” Sometimes a simple photo montage can serve as the most powerful fact-check. Earlier this week, when President Trump resumed his insistence that “Portland is on fire,” I logged onto Getty Images and searched for photos from Oregon. Photographer Spencer Platt had just published dozens of gorgeous day-in-the-life-of-the-city shots. A man sunbathing in a public square; a woman ordering coffee; a couple strolling through a park; this was the reality in the city Trump called a “hellhole.” Yes, Platt also took photos at night of officers standing in formation while protesters gathered outside the ICE facility. But the photos showed the disconnect between Trump’s “Portland is burning to the ground” rhetoric and the on-the-scene reality. Oregon Public Broadcasting did something similar last weekend, with timestamped photos that contradicted Trump’s hyperbole. “Our OPB team is reporting the facts on the ground as they unfold with as much context as we can offer,” said the network’s CEO, Rachel Smolkin. “When the facts diverge from statements about the city, we note the discrepancies.

Consumer sentiment edged a hair lower early this month to a preliminary reading of 55, the University of Michigan said Friday — a weak level rarely seen in the post-World War II era. It’s slightly above the lows it reached this spring when President Donald Trump unveiled massive tariffs. “Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers’ minds,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a release. “Consumers do not expect meaningful improvement in these factors.” The , which stretched into its tenth day on Friday, has not so far affected Americans’ perceptions about the economy, according to the survey. More than a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay. “Interviews reveal little evidence that the ongoing federal government shutdown has moved consumers’ views of the economy thus far,” Hsu said.

Friday’s survey showed “declines in expectations for future personal finances as well as current buying conditions for durables.” Still, that may not mean much for the US economy: Sentiment hasn’t been a good predictor of future spending in recent years. In the summer of 2022 when inflation was running at 40-year highs, sentiment plummeted to its lowest level on record, but Americans continued to spend later that year. That dynamic has persisted.

The BLS has stopped all operations since October 1, when the government’s funding lapsed.

The toy company’s revenue grew 11% in the second quarter to a record $124.2 million, and it even raised full-year guidance – all while mitigating the cost of tariffs. That’s a stark contrast to years of unprofitability before 2012. Investors have taken notice. In the last year alone, Build-A-Bear’s stock is up 76%. In the last five years, the toy company’s share price ( ) has risen nearly 2,000% – besting even tech companies riding the AI boom like Palantir, Nvidia and Microsoft. But the company faces potential headwinds, including the impact of tariffs and increasingly squeezed consumers, who might pare back on non-essentials as they tighten budgets while inflation stays hot. Build-A-Bear broadened its customer base beyond kids and capitalized on customer trends that emerged after the pandemic, focusing on experiences and tapping into what Sharon Price John, the company’s CEO, calls the “nostalgia economy.” “’Kidulting,’ (is) adults wanting to be kids, and they’re buying things that they loved when they were kids. So we leaned into that with really interesting licenses that played on their memory,” John told CNN. Build-A-Bear has licensing deals with nostalgic brands like Hello Kitty, Pokémon and Harry Potter. John said adults and teens are now 40% of the company’s business. “A lot of the adults with kids also have fond memories of Build-A-Bear themselves,” said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. “So they’ve been keen to expose their kids to that. It’s a memory that they have and are fond of, and they’re keen to recreate that for a new generation.” For parents, the fusion of entertainment and product from picking out and building a bear is valuable, as is Build-A-Bear’s price point, especially for birthday bears that cost a customer’s age. “That’s very helpful to the retailer because we are in an era where money’s a bit tighter. People are thinking about what represents value, and Build-A-Bear has a proposition that’s really centered around value,” said Saunders. And while many mall brands have faded, Build-A-Bear is growing. The company announced it would open 60 stores this year, 10 more than previously announced. “Malls are still a big part of what we do, but that’s almost 30-40% of our retail environment,” said John. “Now we’re in tourist locations, cruise ships, hospitality and we also built out our e-commerce business. We had to participate in the digital economy.” Like most toy companies, the company said tariffs will take a bite: an expected $11 million this year, despite front-loading component imports from China and Vietnam, which have 30% and 20% tariffs respectively. The brand has controlled price hikes for now but expects to raise them at some point, albeit in specific spots rather than across-the-board, John said. “I think that that has pleased investors because they’ve said, well, yes, there may be some downside on tariffs here, but it’s significantly less than maybe it is elsewhere in the toy sector,” said Saunders. And as Americans face tighter wallets in the face of inflation, non-essentials – like Build-A-Bear’s product – could get cut from family budgets. the Federal Reserve’s 2% target for years, and has reignited fears that more families could see their incomes shrink. Saunders also cited concerns about slowing foot traffic at shopping malls – and the chance that the current collectibles craze could go the way of Beanie Babies and Cabbage Patch kids in years past. “Some of these (worries) may not materialize in the near-term, but the company needs to be alert to all of them,” said Saunders.", "tags": ["bear", "build", "street"]},

The threat is a massive escalation after months of a trade truce between the two nations. “The United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social Friday afternoon. “Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.” Trump’s announcement is tied to Beijing export controls on its critical rare earths, which are needed to produce many electronics. As a result, Trump appeared to with Chinese President Xi Jinping that was scheduled for later this month in South Korea. Trump’s initial message Friday, delivered via a Truth Social post, in which he threatened “massive” new tariffs, was ill received by investors on Friday as fears of a spring déjà vu, when tariffs on Chinese goods soared to a stunning 145%, set in. Markets closed sharply lower on Friday after Trump’s initial comments, with the Dow falling by 878 points, or 1.9%. The S&P 500 was down 2.7%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 3.5%. While Trump doesn’t always act on his threats, investors, consumers and businesses still have reason to worry. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Although Mexico has recently replaced China as the top source of foreign goods shipped to the United States, America depends on China for hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of goods. Meanwhile, China is one of the top export markets for America. In particular, electronics, apparel and furniture are among the top goods the United States receives from China. Trump has pushed CEOs, especially in tech, to move production to the United States, but he’s in recent months as business leaders have satisfied the president with announcements of hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in US manufacturing — even if they continue to make the bulk of their products overseas. Shortly after imposing minimum 145% tariffs on Chinese goods — an effective embargo on trade, Trump , making them subject to 20% tariffs instead. The move was, in many ways, an acknowledgment that the Trump administration understood the pain he was inflicting on the US economy through his sky-high tariffs. Then, in May, US and Chinese officials further established the interdependence of trade by agreeing to lower tariffs on one another. China brought levies on American exports down to 10% from 125%, and the United States brought rates down to 30% from 145%. Both countries’ stock markets rallied as a result. Trump on Friday claimed trade hostility from China “came out of nowhere.” But in reality, it’s been bubbling up for months. For the United States, a critical part of trade agreements has been to ensure China will increase its supply of rare earth magnets. Yet despite several apparent breakthroughs, Trump has in recent months repeatedly accused China of violating the terms. Trump first responded by putting restrictions on sales of American technologies to China, including a key Nvidia AI chip. Many of these restrictions were later lifted. Then came the Trump administration’s announcement that it would soon impose fees on goods transported on Chinese-owned or -operated ships. China countered with a similar plan on American ships that took effect Friday. In short: Trump has already demonstrated there’s no limit to how high he’ll go with tariffs on China, and Xi has shown no mercy in how he chooses to retaliate. But Trump’s ability to continue to impose tariffs on a whim could soon end, pending the verdict in a landmark case kicking off in the Supreme Court next month.

The Dow fell 879 points, or 1.9%. The broader S&P 500 dropped 2.71% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.56%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each posted their worst day since April as a slide in tech stocks led the market lower. The Dow posted its worst day since May. The S&P 500’s drop of 2.71% saw the index shed roughly $1.56 trillion in market value in one day, according to FactSet data. Trump said in a social media post he is considering a “massive increase” in tariffs on imports from China, adding “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive’” over rare earth exports. His latest threat stems from accusations that China is imposing export controls on rare earths, slow-walking previous agreements to free them up for US businesses. Because of that, Trump said he with President Xi Jinping later this month at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. US stocks had been hovering near . Wall Street in recent months has tried to look past concerns about tariffs, instead focusing on better-than-expected corporate earnings. The president’s post on Truth Social jolted markets, sending Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, soaring by 32% to its highest level since June. “That was clearly not something traders wanted to hear!” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said in a note. “We’d become quite accustomed to relatively quiescent markets with an upward bias, so it was quite shocking to see stocks in a quick freefall.” AI and chip stocks that are sensitive to developments in US-China trade relations dropped lower. Nvidia ( ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( ) fell 4.95% and 7.78%, respectively. “The ramping up of tensions with China is the big story,” said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird. “It definitely caught markets off guard.” Wall Street in recent weeks has also been of AI and tech stocks, leaving them more vulnerable to a surprise. “When you have a shock like today with President Trump, they are going to get hit the most because they’re the most at risk to the economic outlook worsening or corporate earnings retreating due to a potential slowdown,” said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers. Meanwhile, US-based rare earth mining and processing companies jumped higher. USA Rare Earth ( ) and MP Materials ( ) gained 4.96% and 8.37%, respectively. US Treasuries rallied as investors rushed into safer assets amid market volatility and concerns that a reignited trade war could hit economic growth. 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields fell as investors scooped up bonds. Gold and silver, which are considered safe havens amid turmoil, rose 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. “Trump is sparking risk-off sentiments in markets after declaring the potential for massive tariff hikes on China,” Torres said. “Investors are clamoring for safe haven holdings as a heavy increase in levies could weigh on the earnings picture and the economic outlook ahead.” US oil prices slumped 4.2% and Brent crude dropped 3.8% to their lowest levels since May. Oil prices had been trading lower earlier in part due to between Israel and Hamas. Robert Yawger, commodity specialist at Mizuho Securities, said the flare-up in tensions between Trump and Xi stoked concerns of a “demand destruction event,” where a trade war weighs on economic growth and demand for oil. “It’s a mini mirror image of what happened in April,” Yawger said, referring to the in the spring when investors were raising forecasts of a possible recession. dropped from “neutral” into “fear” for the first time since May. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq each turned into the red for the month. “The sell-off has the potential to evolve into a larger correction, especially if the US-China trade truce is over,” Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in an email. “Throughout the summer, greed has far outpaced fear in the US equity market, and the high level of complacency leaves investors vulnerable.” CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald and Matt Egan contributed reporting.", "tags": ["war", "dow", "points", "reignites", "tumbles", "economies", "world", "largest", "trade"]},

Bodycam footage of police arresting a pile of macaroni and cheese. Big Tech wants to give social media an AI makeover – and so far, it’s a bit of a mess. ChatGPT’s Sora app, where some of those scenes popped up last week, is just the latest entrant into the AI social media sphere. Meta’s AI app has a TikTok-like video feed called Vibes. You can chat with AI personas on Instagram in your direct messages. And TikTok’s AI Alive tool turns images into videos with just a simple command. The moves are part of a high-stakes race that could shape the next era of the internet. Winning that race is critical for tech giants as they figure out how to make money from AI amid . Efforts to push AI into our social feeds have raised sweeping concerns across the web, from whether these tools violate copyright laws to how they might contribute to the rampant spread of fake content. OpenAI and Meta directed CNN to the company’s safety policies and guardrails when asked for comment. Within days of the Sora app’s debut, for example, Motion Picture Association CEO and chairman Charles Rivkin that “videos that infringe our members’ films, shows, and characters have proliferated on OpenAI’s service and across social media” because of Sora. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a that the company will soon give rights holders “more granular control over generation of characters” and that it is exploring a revenue-sharing model. Prompts with copyrighted characters, like Pikachu or Spongebob, now result in an error message saying the content “may violate our guardrails concerning similarity to third-party content.” AI has only amplified long-standing worries about misinformation on social media. But sophisticated tools like Sora, which can create lifelike-looking footage, have taken those fears to a new level, especially since it’s relatively easy to remove the watermarks indicating such videos are AI-generated, as tech publication discovered and CNN has tested. Sora-generated videos are also embedded with C2PA metadata – a behind-the-scenes industry standard signature denoting a video’s origin. The company also says its tech can detect people and public figures as part of its measures to prevent deepfakes. Meta says media created with its AI tools have an “invisible watermark” to help it track harmful AI-generated content as well as AI labels. There are also growing concerns that AI chatbots are particularly harmful to teens following a string of that AI personas on the app Character.AI and mental health issues among young people. OpenAI Sora includes “stronger protections for young users,” such as restrictions on generating mature content and restricting adults from initiating messages with teens. Meta uses technology to prevent adults who have shown suspicious behavior from viewing and interacting with teen content, the company said. Then there’s the question of whether consumers want “AI slop” flooding their feeds in the first place. There’s nothing about the deluge of randomness on Sora and Meta AI that makes me want to endlessly scroll. The very concept of combining social media with AI assistants caused confusion earlier this year. Some Meta AI users were seemingly unaware that their AI prompts – some of which are like medical or legal questions – were part of the app’s public feed. Meta said at the time that chats are private by default and aren’t shared to the Discover feed unless users share them through a multi-step process. To be fair, endless scrolling isn’t the point of Sora and Meta AI. Those apps are designed to encourage users to create more videos using OpenAI and Meta’s respective tools, likely a bid to become the platform of choice for the next generation of influencers and internet stars as they increasingly adopt AI. But the striking resemblance to TikTok and other short-form video apps sends the message that these platforms are indeed trying to be a destination for viewing content rather than just a forum for creators. It’s perhaps a new form of social media entirely that even companies like OpenAI and Meta are still figuring out.", "tags": ["media", "social", "messy"]},
{"content": "Tech giant Nvidia is the world’s leading artificial-intelligence chipmaker, but the company’s success has also put it in the crossfire of trade tensions. The Santa Clara, California-based company, which is approaching a market capitalization of $5 trillion, has seen rapid growth due to its chips, which are predominantly used to power massive data centers used by other tech firms, like OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT. But Nvidia’s leading technology has been used as a negotiating tool in President Donald Trump’s trade spat with China, which was kickstarted by Trump’s sweeping tariffs in April and has . It’s further complicated Nvidia’s relationship with China, where it was doing roughly 25% of its graphics processing unit sales, estimates Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. Nvidia’s popularity has also embroiled the company in a steep controversy for potentially allowing China to skirt around export restrictions as trade tensions continue. “Nvidia has gotten caught in the middle of two very important things: a trade dispute between China and the United States … but more importantly, AI has become a matter of national security,” Luria said. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has argued that restricting sales of American AI chips will ultimately enable Chinese developers to create their own alternatives. Huang, 62, was born in Taiwan, and at age 9 was sent by his parents to live in Tacoma, Washington. In 1993, the Oregon State and Stanford University grad co-founded Nvidia, which started as a graphics-based processing company. Huang — who is worth $167 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — has been treated as a in Taiwan for his success in the AI chips race, and previously worked as a microprocessor designer at now-competitor AMD. “It’s really unusual to have somebody who can go from starting what was at the time a very small tech startup and grow it to the extraordinary level of success that Nvidia has grown to,” John Villasenor, a nonresident senior fellow at Brookings Institution and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said of Huang. Nvidia powers the data centers that support AI technology and has been the go-to provider of those chips. Nvidia essentially created the architecture for anyone who develops AI, leading to a surge in demand for its technology, according to Arun Sundararajan, a professor of technology, operations and statistics at NYU Stern School of Business. The company said in September that it would invest up to and provide it with data center chips as soon as late 2026. Nvidia is competing with AMD for deals with partners like OpenAI, which said Monday it would use to power OpenAI’s data centers. “The competition has undeniably arrived. Customers will choose the best technology stack for running the world’s most popular commercial applications and open-source models. We’ll continue to work to earn the trust and support of mainstream developers everywhere,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNN. In recent years, the US government has sought to to American technology to slow Beijing’s progress on AI, thus allowing the United States to take the lead. Trump continued the trend in April, when he restricted China’s access to chips, including Nvidia’s H20, as part of his trade war. Such restrictions on the sale of chips offended China, Luria said, and ultimately led to Beijing limiting the purchase of chips to their companies. But the White House recently reversed their position. “You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in July. Trump in August greenlit sales of chips to China in an agreement with US chipmakers. Nvidia and AMD, Trump said, would give 15% of revenue from China sales to the US . That includes giving China access to Nvidia’s H20 chips, which were released in 2024 to maintain access to the Chinese market following . But Beijing seemed and trade tensions have only escalated since the start of a tit-for-tat trade war in April. China has since increased import restrictions on US chips, including Nvidia’s processors. Trump said Friday on Truth Social that he would impose a “over and above any Tariff they are currently paying” beginning November 1 over export controls on rare earth minerals. “Where this all gets resolved is unclear,” Luria said, because China believes “that stopping the sale of Nvidia chips into China creates some leverage on the US in the negotiation.” Commerce Department officials are investigating whether Nvidia’s customer, Singapore-based Megaspeed, is helping China sidestep export restrictions for access to Nvidia’s tech, according to a report from the . CNN has not independently verified the Times’ reporting. “We have engaged with the U.S. government regarding Megaspeed, performed our own inquiry, and have not identified any reason to believe products have been diverted. NVIDIA visited multiple Megaspeed sites yet again earlier this week and confirmed what we previously observed—Megaspeed is running a small commercial cloud, like many other companies throughout the world, as allowed by U.S. export control rules. The Administration’s AI Action plan rightly encourages businesses worldwide to embrace U.S. standards and U.S. leadership, benefitting national and economic security,” an Nvidia spokesperson told CNN. And Nvidia’s H20 chips are widely believed to have contributed to , an advanced Chinese AI model that shook Silicon Valley upon its release earlier this year, raising concerns that China was further ahead on AI than previously understood. China could also gain access to the chips on the black market, since another country could buy Nvidia’s chips and resell them to China, Sundararajan said. “The bigger issue is if we push harder to restrict global access to Nvidia’s products, can that be counterproductive? Because it forces these countries to speed up their own pace of innovation,” Sundararajan said. This story has been updated with additional content.

{"content": "The roughly 20 plumbers of Oak Creek Plumbing & Remodeling in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area don’t just bring toolkits with wrenches, pliers and Teflon tape to customers’ homes these days. They also bring a tablet equipped with the latest version of ChatGPT. The technology helps those workers automatically create invoices, work proposals and even brainstorm how to address complicated plumbing problems, company president Dan Callies told CNN. All they have to do is take photos of a broken water heater, for example, or write their observations in a prompt, and ChatGPT spits out a list of recommendations. “It’s definitely been worth the investment,” Callies said. “Some of our older guys have learned to ask ChatGPT the right questions, and they’re kind of amazed with some of answers it comes up with.” From office work to on-the-ground troubleshooting, blue-collar businesses are increasingly embracing AI to boost productivity, cut down costs and even replace administrative support roles. Some use popular AI software such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, while others use platforms tailored specifically for the trades with AI capabilities, such as ServiceTitan and Housecall Pro. “It’s affecting both sides of our company, out in the field and internally within our office,” Callies said. No humans are involved from when a customer requests services from Gulfshore Air Conditioning & Heating in Niceville, Florida to when a technician arrives at their home, thanks to AI. And once the technician arrives, they use AI to diagnose the issue and pull up technical information within seconds — a task that used to require sifting through as many as five 60-page manuals, said Krista Landen, the company’s marketing and IT manager. A across North America by Housecall Pro earlier this year found that more than 70% of respondents said they have tried AI tools and about 40% said they actively use them. Younger professionals are leading the charge, the survey showed, though older workers are testing the waters, too. AI’s integration and impact varies by industry, according to the survey; Plumbers were the most likely to say AI has helped their business grow; cleaners were the “biggest adopters of AI”; while electricians had “the highest satisfaction rates” with the technology. Schools have also taken notice: Jason Altmire, president and CEO of Career Education Colleges and Universities, a trade association that represents more than 800 private vocational schools across the country, said several institutions are weaving AI into their curriculum in collaboration with employers. “They want their graduates ready for jobs that are going to be available in the future, not jobs that were here five years ago,” Altmire said. Still, some tradespeople are skeptical about how the new technology works and how it can be applied to physical tasks. “There’s some hesitancy, so I wouldn’t say they’re all in,” said Edward McFarlane, chair of the board of directors at the Air Conditioning Contractors of America. “But the tide is definitely coming in.” AI is slowly reshaping the economics of blue-collar America. Businesses in the trades implementing AI are becoming more productive, allowing them to take on more projects or improve the quality of their services, said Laura Ullrich, an economist at job site Indeed. “People go into the trades because they like doing the hands-on work itself, and if some of the administrative tasks can be automated, then that should help those workers lean into the parts of the job they like and do smarter work,” she said. AI has already made a measurable impact on Gulfshore, which saw a $370,000 increase in revenue 30 days after upgrading to an AI marketing feature that automates campaigns. The company said it also saw an increase of $150 in revenue per average ticket after implementing AI tools that helped technicians get through administrative tasks more quickly and allowed them to sell customers additional services or accessories. Landen said the higher revenue, if sustained, should eventually translate into higher compensation for technicians. “We’ve been using these AI products since June, so we should start to see more of a benefit in order to roll out new compensation packages (for technicians) within the next six months,” she added. Callies of Oak Plumbing & Remodeling said ChatGPT has allowed the company to “lower our overhead and provide better services or better value.” AI’s growing adoption in the trades could mean businesses may not need to hire as many office workers for marketing and taking customer calls, economists and business owners tell CNN. That presents those businesses the opportunity to cut down on those costs. For now, there’s broad agreement that AI is nowhere near taking away the jobs of technicians, at least not until robotic technology significantly advances. It’s mostly proving to be a useful tool for tradespeople. “All of our technicians are running more efficiently, and they’re less stressed,” Landen said. “I feel like I am a real life Jetson living in the future.”", "tags": ["favorite", "chatgpt", "tool", "plumber"]},
{"content": "Three and a half years since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with a US-led peace process on ice and a stalemate on the battlefield, Kyiv’s allies are calling for renewed economic pressure on Moscow. The aim: to raise the cost of war for the Kremlin to a level that forces it to change course. Eighteen packages of European Union sanctions and dozens more from the United States, United Kingdom and others have weakened Russia’s economy – but not its resolve to carry on fighting. What’s needed, then, is not just more but smarter penalties, experts say. “We just need to be cleverer,” said Timothy Ash, a Russia researcher at the UK-based Chatham House think tank who has advised a number of governments on the impact of sanctions against Moscow. A massive rise in military spending helped the Russian economy grow more than 4% in 2023 and 2024, but this year the government is expecting just 1% growth. It also sees inflation at 6-7% by the end of the year, and interest rates are at a painful 17% level, aimed at containing price rises. The Kremlin’s hugely important earnings from oil and natural gas are falling and the budget deficit – the gap between government spending and revenue – is widening. Yet the latest three-year budget plan, submitted to parliament in late September shows that will stay at around four times pre-war levels. And that’s thanks largely to Russian taxpayers. Starting from January, the Kremlin has decided to raise value-added tax (VAT) from 20% to 22%, with the extra revenues “primarily directed” toward defense and security, according to the . Russian President Vladimir Putin has openly acknowledged the economic cost of raising VAT, earlier this month that the measure would “be reflected in economic growth” – but he still defended it. The Kremlin’s decision is “consistent with planning for a long conflict and a prolonged regime of constrained private demand,” Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNN. In other words, the Russian government has accepted the growing economic pain of the war. But are there potential penalties so damaging that they would sap Russia’s resolve to keep fighting? The 500% tariff on any country buying Russia’s energy exports proposed in the Sanctioning Russia Act – with bipartisan support in the US Congress but not yet brought to a vote – would certainly be one, argues Ash, an associate fellow in Chatham House’s Russia and Eurasia program. “That would totally halt Russian exports. It would absolutely definitely crash the Russian economy and stop the Russian war machine,” he told CNN. But no one, including Putin, who called the idea “impossible to imagine” last week, expects the US to go through with it, because taking Russian oil and natural gas off the market would raise global prices. Instead, Ash suggests a much lower so-called , of 20-30%, which would allow Russian exports to continue flowing to the global market, but with a twist: The revenue generated should be used to fund Ukraine. Using Russian wealth to fund Ukraine is at the heart of discussions in Europe right now about another economic measure – one that would also send a clear message on Kyiv’s longevity in this war. According to a number of media reports based on an internal European Union document, the EU is considering using Russia’s frozen assets in Europe as the basis of a €140 billion ($162 billion) loan to Ukraine. Kyiv would be required to repay the debt only if Russia paid reparations for its war. The new loan would send “a really strong signal to Russia,” according to Ash, “that Ukraine is well-financed (and) it will be able to buy the weapons to sustain a long war.” In an opinion piece in the Financial Times backing the plan, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also wrote that “Moscow will only come to the table to discuss a ceasefire when it realizes Ukraine has greater staying power.” Another option is to target new measures at the weakest points in Russia’s economy, suggests Alexander Kolyandr, a senior fellow with the Democratic Resilience Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis. His idea centers on Russia’s long-standing labor shortages, which since the war broke out and many working-age men have either been mobilized or fled overseas. Currently, Russian citizens face extra hurdles applying for work visas in some European countries, with the Baltics and Poland effectively banning them. “Instead of limiting professional immigration from Russia to the West, I think a brain drain should be only encouraged,” said Kolyandr. Doing so would exacerbate Russia’s labor crisis, as well as put an upward pressure on wages, complicating its battle against inflation, he noted. As well as taking a new approach to sanctions, enforcing existing sanctions more effectively is essential, experts say. In a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine on the night of October 5, Russia, according to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, used more than 500 weapons systems containing over 100,000 foreign-made parts – including European ones. That’s despite Western sanctions banning the sale of billions of dollars’ worth of military and dual-use components to Russia. “Now, in the fourth year of the full-scale war, it is simply strange to hear anyone claim they don’t know how to stop the flow of critical components,” Zelensky . Penalties for non-compliance need to be properly enforced, according to Ash. “There’s a huge windfall to these individuals, companies and countries helping Russia break sanctions,” he said, “but no penalties… no one goes to jail.” But perhaps the most effective penalty on Russia’s war economy is in the hands not of Ukraine’s allies but Ukraine itself. In recent months, Kyiv’s escalating long-range drone strikes on Russian oil refineries have, according to a recent estimate by Russia’s analytics agency, knocked out 38% of Russian oil refining capacity – though Sergey Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, has said that such estimates do not account for how much was idle before and how much damage has been repaired. Still, the strikes led to shortages of gasoline in Russia and caused it to crude oil, which is generally less profitable than selling refined products. Ash believes the strikes are a potent weapon against Russia’s economy, for two reasons: “You’re not only causing domestic disruption to the economy through a shortage of fuel at the pumps, but you’re actually capping their export receipts as well.” This strengthens the argument for supplying more Western long-range weapons to Ukraine and with fewer restrictions on their use, he told CNN. And, based on Putin’s recent reaction, this is something Russia may fear more than any economic sanction. At a Russian economic forum last Friday, Putin was asked what would happen if the US allowed the delivery of its intermediate range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. Perhaps hoping to dissuade the Trump administration, he replied that it would lead to the “destruction of US-Russia relations.”", "tags": ["war", "experts", "russia", "cost", "raise"]},
{"content": "The families of the 16 victims killed in the devastating blast at a Tennessee explosive plant have been notified, authorities said at a Saturday news conference. No one has been found alive in the search and investigators are working through the scene foot by foot, Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said. Earlier officials thought 18 people were missing but they were able to locate two people off site, officials said. “We’re moving to recovery,” Davis said with emotion during a news conference one day after the blast, his voice trailing off at times. “At this time, we have recovered no survivors.” “As we get into this, we find it even more devastating than what we thought initially,” he added. Early Friday, the thundering blast at reverberated across a tight-knit community, razing an entire building on the plant’s sprawling campus. The recovery effort was being made “more volatile” with the presence of ordnance at the site, and investigators were working with the FBI to use cell phone technology to figure out what happened at the time of the explosion, Davis said. Investigators were also using DNA to try to identify the remains of victims. Melissa Dawn Stanford, a 53-year-old production supervisor at the plant, is believed to have died, her niece, Brittany Kirouac, told CNN in a statement Saturday. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation informed Kirouac they don’t believe her aunt could have survived, she said. “To say our family is devastated is to put it lightly. We are honestly at a loss for words and grief is not linear. In the past 24 hours I have seen: anger, sadness, bargaining, denial, and acceptance,” Kirouac said. “Not only from our family, but from the families who surrounded us waiting to hear news about their loved ones,” she continued. “At this time, we are just hoping to bring her home to say goodbye.” Kirouac asked for prayers as her family, like so many others, attempts to “navigate these coming days, weeks, and months.” Davis said more than 300 people had searched “almost every square inch” of the plant. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ elite National Response Team, which provides a range of specialists who investigate bombings and wildfires, is part of the complicated recovery operation. “I never want to give up hope. Hope’s always been my heart, but I don’t want to give false hope either,” Davis said. “We need our communities to come together and understand that we’ve lost a lot of people. This don’t only affect those families, it runs deeper … this could be people that you grew up with,” Davis said, noting one victim was a childhood friend of his. The explosion occurred during an early shift at Accurate Energetic Systems, a manufacturer of military and demolition explosives that employs scores of local residents. “Prayers are needed … our hearts are broken for the families and for the loved ones that lost their lives,” Wendall Stinson, the manufacturer’s CEO, said alongside officials Friday. The blast triggered a series of smaller explosions, officials said, and the cause is still under investigation. Officials will be on site Saturday detonating explosives because “chemicals are more unstable” than previously thought, according to a source familiar with the investigation. The source added the timing of these controlled explosions is unknown but will be audible to people in the area, noting the point is to ensure the area is safe. Investigators are also pulling employment records, according to the source. Here’s what we know as the investigation continues: The explosion happened around 7:45 a.m. local time, waking residents for miles around. “I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,” Gentry Stover told explaining how he was jolted awake. It took him only moments to piece what happened together. “I live very close to Accurate (Energetic Systems), and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.” Officials said the explosion was felt as far as 15 miles away, but Cody Warren, who lives more than 20 miles from the plant, told CNN the noise woke him and at first he thought lightning had struck his house. “I went outside and could still hear the ring of the sound off in the distance. I thought maybe it was an earthquake or a meteor explosion,” Warren told CNN. Closer to the plant, charred debris and mangled vehicles were spread across a vast area. Davis called it “the most devastating scene that I’ve seen in my career.” Residents who are being asked to call their local sheriff “so trained personnel can respond safely.” Officials are requesting everyone to avoid the area near the plant while emergency teams do their job. It’s unclear how many people were inside the plant when the explosion happened, Hickman County Mayor Jim Bates said. “It’s going to be an investigation that’s probably going to go on for days,” Bates said. The ATF and Hickman and Humphreys counties’ sheriff’s offices will co-lead the investigation, which will also include the FBI, the officials said. In a Friday evening, AES called the explosion a “tragic accident” and said, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, coworkers, and community members affected by this incident.” As of Friday evening, authorities were still working to contact some of the next-of-kin of employees who were believed to have been inside the building at the time of the explosion, a law enforcement source told CNN. As part of the ongoing effort to determine which company employees may have been among the victims, the source said authorities are now also conducting analysis of records from nearby cell phone towers. The sophisticated process involves comparing the cell phone numbers of employees with local cell phone tower registration records to help pinpoint the geographical location of a device at the time of the explosion. Davis noted people in the community were undergoing a “gauntlet of emotions” as many awaited word of loved ones. “I understand that some families get mad. I understand that some people get upset. … We’re doing the very best we can to take care of this,” Davis said. Accurate Energetic Systems makes “various high explosive compositions and specialty products” for the US military and industrial markets, according to the company’s page. The AES plant employs around 80 people, the Hickman County mayor said. The facility is spread across 1,300 acres in a rural, wooded area off Interstate 40, roughly 60 miles west of Nashville near the border of Hickman and Humphreys Counties, officials said. The relatively remote area where the plant is located is typically patrolled by smaller law enforcement departments, so other agencies have volunteered resources for support, a source told CNN. The site consists of five production buildings and “a quality lab for product evaluation and analysis,” according to a from the nongovernmental Association of the United States Army, which lists AES as a sponsor. Last month, the Department of Defense AES a nearly $120 million contract “for the procurement of TNT.” Tennessee state Sen. Kerry Roberts told CNN the company is a beloved employer for many, with workers often seen at community events sporting baseball caps with the company’s logo. “It is a well-loved company in the area,” Roberts said. “This is going to have a devastating impact on quite a few families.” The plant has suffered deadly accidents in the past and faced federal fines related to workplace safety practices, according to media reports and federal data. In April 2014, an explosion at the facility killed one worker and injured four others, CNN affiliate reported. The blast, in the back of a building used for shotgun ammunition, caused severe damage. At the time, authorities said several companies operated on the property, and the explosion happened in an area run by Rio Ammunition. Tennessee OSHA said Saturday the 2014 incident involved a different company, American Sporting Supplies, which was leasing a building at the site at that time. American Sporting Supplies no longer operates there, and Accurate Energetic Systems was not connected to the 2014 incident, according to Tennessee OSHA. Years later, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the company $7,200, after a 2019 inspection found violations related to personal protective equipment, employee exposure to contaminants and inadequate safety training, among other citations. The company contested the findings, OSHA records show, and eventually reached a formal settlement. Details about the inspection and its conclusion are limited, and it’s unclear if the plant has faced more recent health or safety reviews. Records show the company has reported 46 work-related injuries since 2016, the earliest year on record. No workplace deaths were reported during this period. In 2024, the most recent year for which data is available, the company reported five injuries and one illness. In 2021, a former employee sued the company, alleging wrongful termination after being blamed for a fire that broke out at the facility the previous year. The company disputed the claim, and the case was dropped after mediation. The Tennessee explosion is a stark reminder of the long history of deadly workplace accidents in small-town America. That history includes the 1947 , when a ship carrying ammonium nitrate exploded and killed nearly 600 people, and the 2013 in West, Texas, which killed 15 people. A wave of high-profile industrial accidents in the 1960s prompted legislative action, leading to the OSHA’s creation, signed into law by President Richard Nixon. A small crowd gathered for a vigil Friday evening at a nearby park, holding candles as they prayed for the missing and their families, joining voices to sing “Amazing Grace,” the AP reported. The Humphreys County sheriff said the incident struck close to home, placing a heavy strain on the tight-knit community. “There are three families that’s involved in this that I’m very close to. When you have small counties like this, we know each other … we love each other,” Davis said. Three individuals with “minor injuries” were treated at TriStar medical facilities in Dickson, according to a TriStar Health spokesperson. Two were discharged, while one remained under observation in an emergency room as of late Friday, the spokesperson said. Among those hurting Saturday was Janie Brown, who sought comfort at a prayer vigil at a chapel in McEwen, Tennessee. She said she knew and worked with some victims and their families. “It’s going to be a sad, sad day in our community for a while,” she lamented, urging people to “give us time to heal and pray for us.” The focus now should be on the families, not on how the tragedy occurred, she said. “The time is not to worry about why it happened, it’s to worry about who it happened to, the families,” said Brown, adding the victims “were loved by their families and by their communities … Everybody knew them.” CNN’s Taylor Galgano, Nicquel Terry Ellis, Jason Morris, Caroll Alvarado, Chris Youd, Casey Tolan, Josh Campbell, Dalia Faheid and Martin Goillandeau contributed to this report.", "tags": ["explosive", "dead", "plant", "officials", "survivors", "massive"]},
{"content": "The US trade war with China has a major sticking point: rare earth minerals. China , leading US President Donald Trump to threaten economic retaliation and imply he would during an upcoming visit to Asia. The tussle over rare earths precedes the current administration; China has built up near-total control of the minerals as part of its wider . China’s restrictions are also seen as a response to Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” on Chinese goods announced in April. After agreeing on a trade truce in Geneva, US officials had expected China to ease export restrictions on those minerals. Here’s what you need to know about rare earths. Rare earths include 17 metallic elements in the periodic table made up of scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides. The name “rare earths” is a bit of a misnomer, as the materials are found throughout the Earth’s crust. They are more abundant than gold, but they are difficult and costly to extract and process and are also . Rare earths are ubiquitous in everyday technologies, from smartphones to wind turbines to LED lights and flat-screen TVs. They’re crucial for batteries in electric vehicles, as well as MRI scanners and cancer treatments. Rare earths are also essential for the US military. They’re used in F-35 fighter jets, submarines, lasers, satellites, Tomahawk missiles and more, according to a 2025 research from CSIS. Sixty-one percent of mined rare earth production comes from China, according to the International Energy Agency, and the country controls of the global output in the processing stage. There are two types of rare earths, categorized by their atomic weights: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths are more scarce, and the United States doesn’t have the capability to separate rare earths after extraction. “Until the start of the year, whatever heavy rare earths we did mine in California, we still sent to China for separation,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN. However, the Trump administration’s announcement of sky-high tariffs on China in April derailed this process. “China has shown a willingness to weaponize” America’s reliance on China for rare earth separation, she said. The US has one operational rare earth mine in California, according to Baskaran. Beijing is using rare earths as major leverage in the trade war, and its latest restrictions come as Xi and Trump are scheduled to meet at the APEC summit in South Korea later this month. In its most recent move, China – holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium, and related magnets and materials – to its existing control list, requiring export licenses. That makes the total amount of restricted rare earths to 12. China will also require licenses to export rare earth manufacturing technologies out of the country. It’s not the first time this year that Chinese restrictions on rare earths have angered Trump. In June, Trump said on Truth Social that as Beijing kept its export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products. The export controls could have a major impact, since the US is heavily reliant on China for rare earths. Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of US imports of rare earth compounds and metals came from the country, according to a . But it’s China’s latest restrictions that are seen as a dramatic escalation in Trump’s trade war between the world’s two biggest economic powers. “Dependent on what China says about the hostile ‘order’ that they have just put out, I will be forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially counter their move,” Trump on Truth Social Friday. “For every Element that they have been able to monopolize, we have two,” he added.", "tags": ["central", "rare", "minerals", "trump", "earth", "threats"]},
